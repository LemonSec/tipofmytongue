3
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,139
you can

4
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,160
all right I guess we should get started

5
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,370
there seems to be a little bit of

6
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,650
confusion about the rooms this is the

7
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,420
padang room this is the IRT F open

8
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,400
meeting if you're looking for the

9
00:04:48,420 --> 00:05:00,150
Collier room you should be next door

10
00:04:50,400 --> 00:05:02,250
okay so this is the ITF open meeting my

11
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,179
name is Colin Perkins and the the ICF

12
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,860
chair there should be blue sheets

13
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:12,810
circulating shortly please make sure you

14
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,750
sign in a reminder that the the usual

15
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,600
IRT f intellectual property disclosure

16
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,270
rules apply to this meeting I know as

17
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,150
with the ietf sessions if you have if

18
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,770
you know of IPR related to the to the

19
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,190
discussion when you're making a

20
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,370
contribution you need to disclose that

21
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:34,500
in addition I'd like to remind you that

22
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:39,270
this meeting will be being recorded and

23
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:42,650
the recording will be made public and

24
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:46,830
that we have a code of conduct and

25
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:51,679
please work work respectfully with

26
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,680
others when participating in the IRT F

27
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,169
also I'd like to remind you that this is

28
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,740
an IRT F and internet research task

29
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:04,590
force session and I remind that the IRT

30
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,470
F is focused on longer term research

31
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,890
issues and will discuss more of this

32
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:12,230
later in this session but unlike the ITF

33
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,180
sessions which are happening this week

34
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,270
this is a research group it is not a

35
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,080
standards development organization

36
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,700
research standards and if if you're not

37
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,289
familiar with the the difference between

38
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:32,070
the IRT F and the IETF RFC 74 18

39
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:34,500
is a really nice primer for new I new

40
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:43,530
participants in the eighth RTF who have

41
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:45,480
been used to the ietf process we have a

42
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:48,299
number of ways in which you could keep

43
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,940
yourself informed about the IRT F we've

44
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,010
got the IRT F dot org web page which

45
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,320
lists information about all the research

46
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,969
groups about all the other activities we

47
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:02,190
do here we have Facebook and Twitter

48
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,900
accounts that the Twitter account is

49
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,270
perhaps a more active than the Facebook

50
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,419
page but we have them and feel free to

51
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,180
follow us on social media if that's your

52
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,620
thing we also have mailing lists for

53
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:20,610
those who like things more old-school

54
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:23,970
and please subscribe to the lists so

55
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,420
yeah I RTF is comprised of a number of

56
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:30,570
research groups right we have 14

57
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:34,320
research groups in the IRT F of which 13

58
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,940
of them are meeting this week that the

59
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,560
den our G group is not meeting the

60
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,100
decentralized infrastructure group but

61
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,750
all the rest are meeting of these two of

62
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,720
them the computation in the network

63
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,060
group and the quantum Internet's group

64
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,970
proposed research groups new groups get

65
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,740
a year to access acts as if they are a

66
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,540
research group and then we that they go

67
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,490
for a review and we decide if they

68
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,070
should be made permanent for research

69
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,500
groups the the computation the network

70
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,650
group will be having that that that

71
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,760
review this week the quantum internet

72
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,359
group will be doing that at the next

73
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,219
meeting all the rest are for full

74
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,320
research groups the majority of them

75
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,420
have still to meet so look out for them

76
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:21,599
on the agenda and please do consider

participating in addition to the

78
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,570
research groups we run to other

79
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,640
activities in the IRT F those of you who

80
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,020
were at the meeting in Montreal earlier

81
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,390
in the year would have seen the applied

82
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,789
networking research workshop for 2019

83
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,669
running in parallel with with the a

84
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:41,159
meeting in Montreal and pleased to

85
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,189
announce that the 2020 applied

86
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,079
networking research workshop will

87
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,280
collocate with the ITF in Madrid next

88
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,170
summer

89
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,020
that workshop will be chaired by Mira

90
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,000
and Roland who many of you will know

91
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:55,829
look out for the call for papers for

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,420
that in the next couple of weeks I

93
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,620
expect the paper submission deadlines

94
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,650
will be in the sort of March April

95
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,510
timeframe and the proceedings will be

96
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,670
published in the ACM digital library

97
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:12,300
this is all running in conjunction with

98
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:15,260
a CMC cup the other activity we we have

99
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,359
is the applied networking research prize

100
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:20,130
this is a prize awarded for recent

101
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,680
results in a plain networking research

102
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,780
which may be relevant to transitioning

103
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,640
into internet products related standards

104
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,870
and the IRT F and the IETF we've got one

105
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,699
a NRP

106
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,230
Prize winning talk which will be

107
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,200
happening just just after I finish these

108
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:40,170
introductory remarks by waiting Cheng

109
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,470
who be talking about of passive paths

110
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:47,430
tcp exploits and how wireless wireless

111
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,650
routers can jeopardize your secrets we

112
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,439
also have the nominations for the 2020

113
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,020
applied networking research prizes which

114
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,680
are now open if you go to the IRT F dot

115
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,890
org slash

116
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,349
a and RP websites if you've read any

117
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,970
good papers on applied networking

118
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,760
research anything which you think would

119
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,190
be deserving of a prize to bring me off

120
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,250
bring the offer to the IRT F and the IAT

121
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:13,920
F for a week then please consider

122
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,360
nominating that work the deadline for

123
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,550
nominations is at the end of this week

124
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,370
but we're always looking for good good

125
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,290
good nominations good work to

126
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,510
potentially award the price to we

127
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,420
typically award two prizes for each of

128
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:34,100
the IETF meetings so we're looking for

129
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,709
six good papers to make the

130
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,720
we had hoped to have to to price price

131
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:43,040
winning talks today the the other

132
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,240
speaker the / awardee had family issues

133
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,010
which meant that she couldn't attend

134
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,270
this meeting so we'll be postponing that

135
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:53,090
talk and won't be doing it one of the

136
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:56,480
later meetings instead so that's about

137
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:59,720
all I have to say the agenda for today

138
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:03,650
the first thing we have up is we tank

139
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:07,490
with his a NRP prize-winning talk say on

140
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:09,740
TCP exploits following that we've got a

141
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,770
brief update on the computation in the

142
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:16,010
network research group which as I say is

143
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,689
finishing its third meeting and will be

144
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,280
up for transitioning from proposed

145
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,340
research group to full research group

146
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,670
after this this week and then we've got

147
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,950
some discussion we've got a little bit

148
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,569
of discussion from Melinda will be

149
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:34,310
leading talking about the relation

150
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:36,020
between the IRT F and the IETF Erin and

151
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,910
Lawrence will be leading some discussion

152
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,550
about moving work from the research

153
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,290
world into the standards world I'll be

154
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,050
finishing up with some discussion about

155
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,020
how the IETF can help sorry how the IRT

156
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:54,290
F sorry excuse the Tokyo there can help

157
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:57,050
academia and vice-versa so with that I

158
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:00,699
guess we should move on to the price

159
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,699
winning talk waiting

160
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,009

cuz I better yeah so today I'm going to

165
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:58,040
share a new side channel we discovered

166
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,439
in all generations our various

167
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,980
technology and how we can export it to

168
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,690
perform of positive injection attacks

169
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,090
this is basically a cross layer attack

170
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:10,130
in which a design choice over its

171
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:15,260
protocol can actually compromise the

172
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:18,110
security and application layer so what's

173
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,960
the what what is the our past history

174
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:24,650
injection attack here's the threat model

175
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,510
we used in our work for now I added

176
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:29,079
Ultra is not involved in this threat

177
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:32,990
model but I will get into that later

178
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,960
typically given to host one client and

179
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,720
the ones target server Mallory is able

180
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,760
to inject spoof data into the wicket in

181
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,460
connection between the client and the

182
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,110
server

183
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:48,590
the attack is performed in the following

184
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,720
steps first Malory convicting into

185
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,170
visiting the malicious website for

186
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,690
example via phishing email and then when

187
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,579
the waiting clicks on the link giving

188
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,420
the phishing email and with it the

189
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:05,240
malicious website they transcript well

190
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,670
wrong on the kind of machine which can

191
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,920
initiate two connections went to the

192
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,520
target server and the other one 2d of

193
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,740
past attacker since these two

194
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,930
connections are on our control we can

195
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,560
send arbitrary numbers of requests to

196
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,560
the target server

197
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:25,759
so that the connection between the

198
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:27,949
client and the server can be kept alive

199
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,399
for a long time as long as we keep

200
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:32,569
sending requests to the server as

201
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,939
opposed to man-in-the-middle attacks

202
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:37,759
where the attacker can intercept the

203
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:40,009
response and temper the content Mallory

204
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,239
is completely off pass and can now is

205
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:46,909
job any of these traffic Malory Hiram

206
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:49,489
can send spoofed packets with server's

207
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:51,769
IP address to pretend to be the server

208
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:53,959
of course the client will validates

209
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:58,579
every incoming packet based on some

210
00:14:53,959 --> 00:15:01,219
secret share between and server the

211
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:07,728
secret is created when the connection is

212
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:09,769
established because of the secret is

213
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:12,529
really difficult for the attacker for

214
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:16,039
the office attacker to sense both

215
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,589
packets with the correct secret if we

216
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,959
just do random guess

217
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:23,299
therefore the transcript only on the

218
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,848
kind of machine is also for the purpose

219
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,799
of sending some feedback informing the

220
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:28,369
attacker whether his guessing is correct

221
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,098
or not

222
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:33,199
since the JavaScript has no privilege it

223
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:34,970
can not appear into directing connection

224
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,639
and the still the secret

225
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,499
instead where you lie on such I know to

226
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,869
infer that behavior yourself how the

227
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:45,799
client responds to those both packets

228
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:47,899
and then based on the feedbacks the

229
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,759
attacker can guess multiple runs and

230
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:53,689
finally figure out was the correct

231
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,449
secret you may wonder was the impact of

232
00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:58,129
this read model because even though we

233
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:00,199
can inject spoofed data into the

234
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:02,329
recuiting connection the whole procedure

235
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,569
is performed on the malicious website

236
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:07,969
and the attacker can already control the

237
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:13,009
whole page why would we bother to do

238
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:16,189
this well the trick here is that once

239
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:18,739
the spoof data is accepted by the client

240
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:21,409
it will be cached in the browser for a

241
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:23,089
long time so you can imagine that next

242
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:25,699
time when the user when the richting

243
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:27,789
tries to access the same server the

244
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:30,919
browser where I trained reload this

245
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:32,819
injection page rather than sending a new

246
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,639
request to the server

247
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:38,209
and even worse if the user does not

248
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:43,559
clear the cache manually it can be

249
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:45,839
cached in your browser for years here

250
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,789
supposed to be a video demo but

251
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,369
unfortunately we can no do that so I

252
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:53,879
just take some snapshots to give your

253
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:55,589
sound flavor of how it looks like as I

254
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,979
mentioned earlier when the wig team

255
00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:01,379
tries to access the malicious web site

256
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:03,419
they are actually two connections

257
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,309
underneath one connects to the target

258
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:08,189
server in this case it's the Syrian news

259
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:11,189
web site and the other one connects Judy

260
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:15,149
of pass attacker launching the real

261
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:17,879
attack once the our Wednesday attacks

262
00:17:15,148 --> 00:17:20,579
succeed the injecting page will be

263
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:22,500
cached in the browser and when the user

264
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,990
tries to access the homepage of cien

265
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,269
news he or she will actually see this

266
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:30,200
page showing up as we can see there is

267
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:33,419
an injected logging component at the top

268
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,899
this is only our this is a one version

269
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:38,789
of the attack we performed for Windows

270
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:41,668
there is actually another version for

271
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:46,620
Mac OS you can find these two videos

272
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:49,500
through the link given in our paper so

273
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,389
what's the secret I'm talking about you

274
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,950
know that you're successfully injects

275
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,320
poof they tie into the recuiting

276
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,740
connection we need to know how to speech

277
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:04,649
tag validates an incoming packet here's

278
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:06,779
the simplified TCP specification the

279
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:09,689
secret I'm talking about actually

280
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:11,639
straight at home including port numbers

281
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,389
sequence number and you don't

282
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:18,049
acknowledgement number so let's take a

283
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:21,029
close look at a sicko stamp a check as

284
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:23,429
we can see here when the peghead

285
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:25,919
condemns in out our windows sequence

286
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:29,600
number the client will actually send a

287
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,889
reasonable response back to the server

288
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,779
in the other case where the sequence

289
00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:35,639
number is Englander but the

290
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:39,450
acknowledgement number is auto window

291
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:41,639
the packet will be sent a job so we can

292
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,250
see here there is the current will

293
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:45,870
actually behave differently depending on

294
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,560
whether the sequence number is England

295
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:51,780
or not

296
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:54,389
right I actually have a question about

297
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,450
this and I got this question a lot but I

298
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:00,210
don't have a perfect answer for this so

299
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,070
basically the question is that why the

300
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:05,430
client should send a response back to

301
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:08,370
the package even if the package contains

302
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:11,940
an auto window sequence number does

303
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:14,969
anyone in this room know the answer

304
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,730
Oh any reasoning for this because it

305
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,430
sounds weird if you know that the

306
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,640
package is broken in himself regarding

307
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:29,580
the sequence number why we should send a

308
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:31,440
response back right yeah that's a

309
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:36,710
question we can discuss later let's move

310
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:39,810
on so there actually are several tongue

311
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:42,060
side channels against 33 connections

312
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm not going to dig into the details

313
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:48,750
but I won't I just want to summarize the

314
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,900
first to say that such channels have

315
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:54,360
been fixed already the third one

316
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,390
requires a malware running on the kind

317
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,850
of machine to monitor the system in our

318
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,430
work we discovered a new side channel

319
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,550
that is inherent in all generations of

320
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:09,390
wireless technology and the alphas

321
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:11,460
attack we we present in our work only

322
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,440
requires a transcript running on the

323
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,260
kind of machine and all three major

324
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,020
operating systems are affected by your

325
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,450
check it's also worth noting that our

326
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,760
check is the only working one without

327
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:28,530
any mitigation in place and it's

328
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,690
practically infeasible to fix it so from

329
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,389
a hell of a view of the side channel

330
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,910
attacks against TCP connection that are

331
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:37,500
discovered in prior work or often

332
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,630
manifest themselves through the

333
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,320
following control or bulk there are

334
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:46,050
actually two essential building blocks

335
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,210
first anytime you have a channel there

336
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:51,450
must be some global resource shared

337
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:54,090
between the attacker and victim in the

338
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,620
context of TCP side channels depending

339
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,470
on whether the sequence number is

340
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:01,090
England or not

341
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:04,070
the shared state may change accordingly

342
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,230
secondly and most importantly the shares

343
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:11,299
they change must be observable to the

344
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:13,330
attacker so what's the shared resource

345
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:19,519
we discovering about her

346
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:22,490
well the insight is that the half-duplex

347
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:24,649
nature of wellies creates a shared

348
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:27,379
resource between uplink and darling

349
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:28,219
traffic half-duplex is in contrast to

350
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:30,678
folk duplex

351
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,139
photoflex means that both appaling and

352
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:37,100
darling traffic can transmit at the same

353
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:40,189
time well for half duplex only allows

354
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,049
one direction to transmit at a time for

355
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:46,490
wireless networks it makes perfect sense

356
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:48,529
to use half duplex because if both ends

357
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,590
try to just mate at the same frequency

358
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:54,139
and at the same time it's likely to

359
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,230
cause interference back half and then

360
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:59,508
retransmission since half duplex is a

361
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,460
fundamental design choice of well use

362
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:06,320
protocol it's really difficult to change

363
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:12,139
let's considered following two scenarios

364
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:14,720
in wellies let's consider assume that

365
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:16,758
the client has established two

366
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,490
connections went to the target server

367
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:22,159
and the I went to the opposite hacker in

368
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,039
this case the opposite hacker can send

369
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:29,779
both legitimate and spoofed packets to

370
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:32,690
the client because because we're lease

371
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:34,730
is half duplex when both uplink and

372
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,620
downlink traffic are transmitting at the

373
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,440
same time it's likely to cause

374
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,178
interference which enforces either or

375
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,909
both ends to back off and then

376
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,340
retransmit suppose the client gets the

377
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:51,230
chance to transmit then the spoofed

378
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:54,740
packet has to wait to be sent later so

379
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,139
does the third packet as we can see here

380
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,809
the round-trip time of the post probe

381
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:04,879
car now is prolonged due to this

382
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:07,369
particular spoofed packet let's consider

383
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:09,830
a similar scenario compared to the

384
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:11,370
previous one is almost the same except

385
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,699
that now the spoof

386
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:16,559
it can trigger a response Rico that when

387
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,840
the packet contains another Windows

388
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,680
sequence number the kind should send a

389
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:26,159
reason was back right but the issue here

390
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,100
is that the packet is sent back to the

391
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,410
server so how do you how does the

392
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,429
attacker can see this can see the

393
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:37,559
difference well because of these

394
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:41,309
additional response triggered by the

395
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:43,950
spoof to package the cert the packet now

396
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:46,940
the post pop carry now experience more

397
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,070
contention increasing issue on ship time

398
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,950
let's put them together as we can see

399
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,200
there is a timing difference of the

400
00:23:52,950 --> 00:24:02,190
round-trip times for the post pub query

401
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:05,340
in these two scenarios therefore based

402
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:08,429
on the ground ship Thomas the attacker

403
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,550
can determine whether the spoofed packet

404
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:13,620
has triggered a response or not which in

405
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,020
turn tells whether the scible packet

406
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,169
contains a correct sequence member or

407
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,170
not

408
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:26,040
however you may wonder that does the

409
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:29,850
timing difference resulted from these

410
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:33,240
additional response is too small to be

411
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:38,250
measurable well that's true

412
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,830
but what if we can amplify the signal so

413
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,650
in this figure we also illustrate the

414
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:46,470
I'm preferable nature of the search I

415
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:49,679
know in this case the attacker can stand

416
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:52,500
two probing spoofed packets to the

417
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,080
client causing more contention which

418
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:58,800
delays the search post pop Korea ref

419
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,050
even further which means the mole

420
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,270
problem packets we sent the more

421
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:07,190
contention we experienced and therefore

422
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:10,620
we can observe larger round-trip times I

423
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:13,350
also want to mention that this is not

424
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,629
exactly what happens in reality because

425
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:18,149
reality is more complex than this but I

426
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:22,100
hope it can offers a concrete example to

427
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,100
show the timing difference

428
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,810
so far we only discuss conceptually

429
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:31,629
discussed time inside China and its

430
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:34,060
effect now I want to show some empirical

431
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,660
test results to understand the

432
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:40,629
real-world implication we created a

433
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:42,820
total of 16 different setups to make

434
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,250
sure that the timing difference the time

435
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,879
inside China exists in various products

436
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:51,520
we used four different rollers noters

437
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,430
and two different machines of as the

438
00:25:51,520 --> 00:26:00,790
client we also varied the frequency of

439
00:25:54,430 --> 00:26:02,920
each cutters so follow the same probing

440
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,139
strategy I mentioned earlier we measure

441
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,410
the wrong shape terms of the post pop

442
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:10,870
carry weighs 100 runs we pick three

443
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:14,080
representative test results here as we

444
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:17,439
can see the timing difference is clear

445
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,080
and measurable on average is about 2

446
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,180
milliseconds and also the timing

447
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,669
difference grows as we increment the

448
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:29,080
number of popping packets we send

449
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:31,900
protests we also measure the round-trip

450
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,659
times at two different locations where

451
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,970
where the attacker is far away from the

452
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,900
richting with round-trip times over 20

453
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:43,120
milliseconds although there is more

454
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,130
overlapping between those boxes

455
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:51,179
the timing difference is still clearly

456
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:54,100
present and measurable so back to the

457
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:58,720
TCP of hassle check where we want to

458
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:02,320
infer the secrets secret let's start

459
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,480
with the pod number inference since the

460
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,520
client will behave differently depending

461
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,260
on whether the sequence number whether

462
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,660
the PO number is correct or not

463
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,590
the attacker can actually send multiple

464
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,170
spoofed

465
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,689
probing packets with a guest sauce phone

466
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,730
number to the client and then determine

467
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,190
whether his guessing is correct or not

468
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:26,470
by simply exploiting the timing

469
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:28,540
side-channel now that we know the PO

470
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:31,180
number we can further infer the sequence

471
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,310
number compared to this PO number

472
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:36,040
inference is a modular sim we can still

473
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,330
apply the guess then checks King chewing

474
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,730
for the sequence number

475
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,408
however the issue here is that it's

476
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,159
unclear whether all the operating

477
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:49,110
systems will behave the same as we is

478
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:53,110
illustrated here so we await the late

479
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:55,539
latest Linux and Mac OS by inspecting

480
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,998
their kernel source code and develop it

481
00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:01,269
it has a program to measure behaviors on

482
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:03,669
Windows this table shows the behaviors

483
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:07,090
of different operating systems when

484
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:09,639
processing ten identical packets as we

485
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:12,100
can see here the three operating system

486
00:28:09,639 --> 00:28:14,350
behave consistently on sequence number

487
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,109
check which means that we can always

488
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:20,019
apply the gessen checks King to infer

489
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:23,109
the sequence number there's one

490
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:30,279
interesting fact of about the behaviors

491
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:32,439
of windows in it I didn't show the show

492
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,080
the numbers in this table you can find

493
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,109
the complete table in our in our paper

494
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,629
so the the fact is that we found that

495
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:43,869
when the so normally in the alpha see

496
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:46,090
draft we says that the client should

497
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:47,470
send a response back when the packet

498
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:53,350
contains and out her window seek wisdom

499
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:56,830
/ right but we I'm sorry so in the

500
00:28:53,350 --> 00:29:00,189
average C draft it says that we should

501
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:03,309
accept any sequence number in the window

502
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,649
right but we found that in Windows if

503
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:08,918
the connection is idle then it only

504
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:11,649
accept sequence number that exactly

505
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:16,629
equal children next expected sequence

506
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:17,199
number and this behavior is never I

507
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:21,129
guess

508
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,159
never specified in any RFC standards so

509
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:27,668
I don't know why windows have

510
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,669
implemented in this way so if anyone

511
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:34,570
from Microsoft knowing the answer for

512
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:37,749
this and we appreciate answered ok let's

513
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:39,999
continue the implementation for

514
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:42,519
acknowledgement number check actually

515
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:45,850
varies significantly from one device to

516
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:48,220
another so we propose customized

517
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,219
strategies for each operating system by

518
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:54,049
exploiting HTTP but

519
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:57,299
occasion and the behaviors of browsers

520
00:29:54,049 --> 00:30:00,270
remember that our ultimate goal is to

521
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:02,309
perform a plasticity injection attacks

522
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,389
we don't actually need to know the exact

523
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:07,860
egg number to perform the attack

524
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:12,419
therefore we can just brute force every

525
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:15,030
possible act number and even though we

526
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,919
can still exploit the time inside

527
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,840
channel to infer the egg number the

528
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,510
brute forcing strategy is more efficient

529
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:27,899
only taking a couple seconds as there is

530
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:30,240
no no waiting for check so we are

531
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,850
implemented a complete attack for each

532
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,950
operating system that has results as

533
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,699
shown in the up table regarding the

534
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:40,740
success rate and average tank host we

535
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,440
also to further demonstrate that this

536
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,720
attack is practical we also record the

537
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,179
result under a remote attacker scenario

538
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,100
where the attacker is far away from the

539
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:55,559
richting with round-trip times over 20

540
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:58,439
milliseconds so how serious is the time

541
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:02,780
aside Channel after we discovered this

542
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:06,059
issue we reached out to discuss this

543
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:09,629
vulnerability with HBO to the 11 working

544
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:11,850
group but unfortunately we all agreed

545
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:15,780
that this is almost impossible to be

546
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:18,299
fixed at physical and McClure's that

547
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:22,649
being said we still need to discuss some

548
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:24,809
possible defenses and medications one

549
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:27,960
straightforward idea is to make various

550
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:31,020
photo plaques although research has been

551
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,240
done on this area we are still facing

552
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,700
some real-world challenges which need to

553
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,950
be carefully adjust and there is unclear

554
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,630
when the technology will be readily

555
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:45,960
deployed in practice since our attack

556
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:49,169
also exploited TCP specification making

557
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,880
TCP stack behave consistently regardless

558
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:53,640
of the sequence and acknowledgement

559
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,090
number would be a good defense when

560
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,010
possible strategy to consider is to

561
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:01,889
really meet responses for incoming

562
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,990
packets with auto bingo sequence number

563
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,300
so that the attacker can

564
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:13,320
amplify the signal by simply sending

565
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:16,370
multiple spoofed probing packets lastly

566
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:20,040
in application they're deployed using

567
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,379
HTTPS instead of HTTP can prevent your

568
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,409
check even though it does not eliminate

569
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,360
the root cause of the said channel and I

570
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:30,750
also want to emphasize that deploying

571
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:35,240
HTTPS is not enough if HTTP strict

572
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:38,400
Transport Security security is absent

573
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,950
when we presented example is does the

574
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:45,000
NUS website I showed earlier in the demo

575
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:47,430
you can see that CN news website does

576
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,610
use HTTPS but we can still make the

577
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:53,250
attacks succeed right the theme here is

578
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:55,709
that when the user tries to access the

579
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:59,370
home page of their news website the

580
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:02,370
initial request was submitted over HTTP

581
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:05,510
and then if the server that subsequently

582
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:08,550
redirect the browser to its HTTPS set

583
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:13,770
therefore the attacker can simply inject

584
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:17,129
a spoofed page inject a fake page for

585
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:22,620
the initial request so my point here is

586
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:24,990
that even though you have deployed HTTPS

587
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:30,149
if you do not enforce it

588
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:32,760
then it's useless to conclude we found a

589
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,130
new timing site channel that is inherent

590
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,470
in all generations of various technology

591
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,870
and we show that the time aside China is

592
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:41,910
reliable and amplify herbal and it's

593
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,590
almost impossible to fix it without

594
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:47,160
substantial change to the valley

595
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:49,949
specification we also show that the time

596
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,710
inside China affects Windows Mac OS and

597
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:54,630
Linux by studying their TCP stack

598
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,240
implementation and conducting drone war

599
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,670
attacks against them we also stressed

600
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,460
some possible defenses to alleviate this

601
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:05,190
issue the source code of the attack is

602
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,240
publicly available online so if you are

603
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:11,310
interested you should check it out

604
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,689
that's all for my presentation sex for

605
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:17,690
your attention I'm happy to take any

606
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:17,690
questions thank you very much

607
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:27,000
so I Daniel Kahn Gilmore from the ACLU

608
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,010
thank you for this work this is really

609
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,530
great stuff and it's a good reminder to

610
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:35,070
all of us that timing side channels can

611
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:37,440
be stepping stones towards towards other

612
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,120
problems so I really appreciate the way

613
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,010
that you've connected all the dots here

614
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,710
and showing that this can be done I was

615
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,090
curious about your proposed mitigations

616
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:46,920
whether you've had a chance to test any

617
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:50,550
of them in the same environments that

618
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,320
you tested the the exploit itself so in

619
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:55,140
particular I'm thinking about the

620
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,250
mitigations that can be done at the TCP

621
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,900
layer itself right the the middle

622
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:04,830
mitigation that you described there if

623
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,960
you had a chance to test like modifying

624
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,850
the kernel or something like that to see

625
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,740
whether it would affect the results that

626
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:15,049
you that you got for the other attack

627
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:17,669
yeah there's a good question actually we

628
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:20,430
so if you look at the source code for

629
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:23,450
linux kernel it actually have implements

630
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:25,919
some mechanism that is to greatly made

631
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:28,500
responses for incoming packets but we

632
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,160
found that it's actually only really

633
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:35,490
made full for the income tax that has no

634
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,290
payload so i'm not sure why they doing

635
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,439
this but so you can see that you can

636
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:43,080
actually bypass this check you just need

637
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,630
to add one bad payload to the packet and

638
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:50,670
then it can it doesn't check the limit

639
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:54,300
for the responses so that's another

640
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:57,270
questions i also want to ask why Linux

641
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,790
kernel implement things like this yeah

642
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:03,620
there are a lot of discrepancy about all

643
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:05,820
the implementation of Windows Mac OS and

644
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,740
they seems to have their own

645
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,710
implementation rather than stick to

646
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:16,589
those standards

647
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:19,440
yeah Allisyn mankin salesforce i I

648
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,480
really like this and I also like the

649
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,610
questions you're asking about why TCP is

650
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,080
the way it is yeah it's a very old

651
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:28,500
protocol but I think those would be very

652
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:30,450
good discussions to have in a TCP

653
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,599
working group as

654
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,609
the mitigations you've talked about and

655
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,490
and also check on whether the new

656
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:40,529
transport protocols are you know making

657
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,500
some of the I think there might be less

658
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:47,160
mistake being made now but I had a quick

659
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:50,369
question about your evaluation where you

660
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,440
talked about the average time cost with

661
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:54,720
slide 30 if I was wondering what that

662
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,079
meant what does average time cost mean

663
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,660
is that for ten successes to get through

664
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,809
at that amount of time yeah we launched

665
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:07,230
the attack ten Thomas and then we

666
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:11,119
calculate average time for oded attends

667
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:14,339
attack okay because I wonder if if

668
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,470
connections are typically short which

669
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:18,740
many of them are too short is it much

670
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:23,939
harder to make this attack yeah that's

671
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:29,669
actually it's feasible if you I'm sorry

672
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:31,680
so I talked about this earlier so these

673
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,809
two connections are created by the

674
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,210
transcript which is on the over control

675
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:38,700
right so we can stand up three numbers

676
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:40,170
of requests to the server so that the

677
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,808
connection between the client and the

678
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,819
server will be kept alive for long time

679
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:48,630
otherwise you'll keep sending requests

680
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:50,910
then the the connection will be alive so

681
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:52,589
the attacker can keep the connection yes

682
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:59,250
up a long time okay I hadn't picked that

683
00:37:52,589 --> 00:38:02,089
up thank you yeah thank you so so I had

684
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:05,369
a question to what extent is this

685
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:10,970
specific to Wi-Fi do you know if other

686
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:13,740
wireless networks have similar issues so

687
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,859
as I mentioned earlier this is a

688
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:20,578
fundamental design choice of various

689
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:22,920
protocols so it's and and it it of

690
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:24,990
course makes perfect sense to use half

691
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,539
duplex is there's nothing wrong with

692
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:33,390
half duplex interval this has to deal

693
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:36,599
with it so and so that so we so we

694
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:40,920
discussed this issue with our geo to

695
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:43,970
talking group and yeah they although

696
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,970
they acknowledge this

697
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:50,330
ability but we can do nothing to it

698
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:53,240
yes do you know if other wireless

699
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,810
protocols have similar behavior did you

700
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:00,799
look into that

701
00:38:53,810 --> 00:39:02,810
no all right anymore

702
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,510
sorry chrissteele just to extend that

703
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:07,160
point even though you don't know about

704
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,690
it presumably will apply to any system

705
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,690
that where the last link is half duplex

706
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:17,270
could you open it presumably the same

707
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,299
attack would apply to any system where

708
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:25,910
the last link is half duplex yeah it's

709
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:30,880
not Wi-Fi yeah conceptually it is but I

710
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:41,830
didn't find anything using half duplex

711
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:44,630
Thank You Christian we tomorrow

712
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:48,348
have you considered mitigation such as

713
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:50,300
using randomized delays inverters and

714
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:54,740
would they mitigate this kind of beyond

715
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:56,839
that as a typical mitigation but here's

716
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:00,560
you need to think about implication

717
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:03,560
because the delay can cause I guess if

718
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,790
you want if it will slow down the hook

719
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:11,000
network then it will be another problem

720
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:12,980
right so I'm not sure yeah of course

721
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,609
that you can delay you can add more

722
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:19,310
randomization here there but I'm not

723
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:22,598
sure how we can implement it without

724
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,599
minimal cost

725
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:42,899
okay are there any more questions okay

726
00:40:40,259 --> 00:40:53,190
well let's thank the speaker again thank

727
00:40:42,900 --> 00:41:10,559
you all right thank you next up is Marie

728
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:14,670
Jose so uh well Marie Jose is coming up

729
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:16,950
just a reminder that just a reminder

730
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:18,779
that nominations for the Ani p at US

731
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:21,299
open until the end of the week so if

732
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:23,339
you've read any good applied networking

733
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:26,249
research papers please go to the website

734
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:35,549
and nominate them for the price for next

735
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:38,308
year good afternoon everyone I'm Marie

736
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:42,769
I'm presenting in the name of our tree

737
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:46,259
co-chairs Jeffrey even I and we're coin

738
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:48,749
computing in a network and before I

739
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:50,700
start for the IUB people who heard us

740
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:52,558
this morning this is gonna be old stuff

741
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,480
but at the same time I would like to

742
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,759
thank you for your comments this morning

743
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,930
and to have actually highlighted new

744
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:59,930
things that we should do in our group

745
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:08,009
it's not good enough again oh my god

746
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,930
okay so again thanks a B for hosting us

747
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:13,319
and for the comments so the way who are

748
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:16,098
we with people who want to put computing

749
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:18,440
in the network or network into computers

750
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:20,880
essentially looking at the melding of

751
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,190
computing networking and storage as

752
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,589
things go forward and so we want to

753
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,380
foster research in computing in the

754
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:30,450
network we want to improve the

755
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,839
performance for the networks themselves

756
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,700
and for the application especially the

757
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,549
emerging applications in machine

758
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,989
learning in industrial networks and in

759
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:44,249
autonomous systems where our focus is

760
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:45,859
architectures I'm actually an architect

761
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:47,538
so I'm interested in that

762
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:49,730
protocols we have a lot of people in our

763
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:52,789
group who like developing protocols and

764
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:55,250
also because we also have the link to

765
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:57,470
industrial R&D in the group a lot of

766
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:00,650
people are looking at real-world use

767
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:02,598
cases applications and a lot of work in

768
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:04,910
progress we are a research group we are

769
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:07,039
not producing products we're not even

770
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,770
looking at doing products but we're

771
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:11,900
looking at new ways of using products

772
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,359
new ways of doing research with them and

773
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,779
even fundamental ways of changing maybe

774
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:20,270
the way that we look at how when we move

775
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:22,760
information from place to another what

776
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:29,809
can we do to that information to make

777
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:32,390
the whole thing work better so how did

778
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:34,490
we get there there was some active

779
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,859
networking in the 90s which was more or

780
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:38,808
less successful but got people thinking

781
00:43:36,859 --> 00:43:40,848
that when packets go through the network

782
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:43,579
maybe there's some functions that can

783
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:46,190
actually carry that go with them there

784
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:48,500
was a work I would say in the past maybe

785
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,750
five years in data centers and

786
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,660
especially orchestration of data center

787
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:56,210
elements with the famous paxos protocol

788
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:59,020
and I have the key to this an impression

789
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:02,270
it's hitting me there was a development

790
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:04,700
by barefoot networks amongst others of

791
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,470
the Tofino switches and who are

792
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,288
programmable with the p4 language

793
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:11,000
barefoot was purchased by Intel which

794
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:12,380
gave you know the whole thing a new way

795
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,250
maybe of looking at this computer

796
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,859
architecture

797
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:20,480
edge computing for a lot of us was or

798
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:22,250
made mainly arts or careers it had a lot

799
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,319
of heritage from what people did in

800
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,869
information centric networking name

801
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,940
function networking distributed network

802
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:30,109
there's actually another group a

803
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,510
research group and distributed

804
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:36,609
networking that we plan really to

805
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:40,700
collaborate with a lot of our

806
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:42,020
collaborators are working and work on

807
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,839
something that's called compute first

808
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,940
networking which actually had two very

809
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:50,270
successful workshop even before that we

810
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:52,849
were even thought about as a potential

811
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:57,230
research group I talked about the

812
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:59,690
embedded AI and ml and also if you think

813
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:02,599
about it up to now a lot of people

814
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:04,130
thinking of applications there were edge

815
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,170
applications they were cloud

816
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:07,970
applications maybe more and more just

817
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:11,410
cloud and there's a lot of applications

818
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:15,669
that are poorly served if you only do

819
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:18,049
cloud in terms of delays in terms of

820
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:20,540
intermittent connectivity and a lot of

821
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:26,839
things that maybe you want to do in

822
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:31,849
between the two edges so our history we

823
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:33,680
first met in in Montreal close now not

824
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:34,540
eighteen months ago it's not Infocom

825
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,770
it's sigcomm

826
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,750
we had a lot of meetings there we met

827
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:42,009
people at usenix this year we met in

828
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:45,319
Bangkok we met in Prague we met in

829
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:49,040
Montreal during the summer we're meeting

830
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:51,400
here we had two web-based interims

831
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,410
and we had two icons on p4 and data

832
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,390
filtering in Montreal and actually over

833
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:59,598
that weekend we're meeting this week on

834
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:02,020
Friday so please come we're very lucky

835
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,790
that we have a bunch of collaborators

836
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,829
around the world I was proud this week

837
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:09,500
that we had also people from Singapore

838
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:12,200
who collaborated to the hackathon and

839
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,329
people from South America so I think it

840
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,879
was great that we were basically having

841
00:46:14,329 --> 00:46:19,339
people from everywhere and so we have a

842
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,800
really good mix of computer scientist

843
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:24,020
application developers implementers and

844
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,089
people in industry so it creates really

845
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:30,490
a great way of discussing about where

846
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:33,859
this is going so this is a work matrix

847
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:36,229
this idea that there's the cloud there's

848
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:38,779
the edges everything in between and how

849
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:43,010
can we distribute the computation inside

850
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:45,800
the network to essentially make things

851
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,750
better and make things better it's not a

852
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,250
single thing and it's not a single set

853
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,160
of requirements and it's not a single

854
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:54,440
set of performance indicators it

855
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,460
actually depends on what the application

856
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:00,740
and what the service needs I don't have

857
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:03,500
a lot of time so I'm gonna go fast over

858
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,839
this but this is all part of the

859
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,780
discussions that we've been having for

860
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:10,100
the past year where do we want to put

861
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,740
these

862
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:15,839
obviously not all boxes will perform

863
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,549
network related functions there was

864
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,780
actually a comment this morning about

865
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:21,960
the fact that there's encrypted

866
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:25,830
transports and some of these things will

867
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:28,410
not be compatible what does it mean to

868
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:31,860
do packet processing to which level do

869
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:34,410
we want to act on the packets do we just

870
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,020
want to filter them so we can do

871
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,730
something once the information filter

872
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,530
with the residual error which actually

873
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,630
are the residual packets which would be

874
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:48,210
something that is very much related to

875
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:50,910
AI maybe we just don't want just to do

876
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,650
compute but also storage I said if we do

877
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:54,240
packet filtering we may want to store

878
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,390
these things where do we want to store

879
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,470
these things how do we deal with

880
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,390
discovering where they could be stored

881
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:02,459
how do we deal with the security of the

882
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:05,400
data the privacy so it's all part of

883
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:08,430
that obviously if I'm a developer I

884
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,800
don't want to specify where my computing

885
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:13,890
is but I may want to know how there's a

886
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,700
discovery mechanism to allow me to find

887
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:20,339
where this computing and this caching if

888
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:25,470
necessary will be done in the best way

889
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:27,540
and obviously more and more in big data

890
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,759
applications there's an awful lot of

891
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,820
data at the edge and we may want to do

892
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:35,160
some computing to reduce this

893
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:38,220
information and manage this data

894
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,200
implosion I come from Canada in the

895
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:42,419
northern regions of Canada there is not

896
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,040
there is no broadband and even if we

897
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,780
want to have some big data applications

898
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,759
there for monitoring the environment for

899
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,890
example at one point we need to use a

900
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,630
satellite to go up and we may want to do

901
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:53,629
some local processing before we do that

902
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:02,220
our objective is to systematically look

903
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:03,810
at these different instantiations we had

904
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,609
comments from the beginning and people

905
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:08,850
who are here will recognize themselves

906
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:11,280
we're saying well are there any common

907
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:13,080
principles or their common abstractions

908
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,460
are there ways that we could do that in

909
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:19,560
common or this will be completely a

910
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:22,200
dislocated type of set of things that

911
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,950
really don't work together I think we

912
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,460
find

913
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:28,200
this may not be completely true but

914
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,839
there are common things we're thinking

915
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:34,049
of common data layers right now and at

916
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:35,759
least common computing architectures we

917
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:39,660
want to know what are the best practices

918
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,040
we want again to look at if there are

919
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:44,430
non forwarding functions

920
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,839
obviously not all nodes or forwarding

921
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:48,359
and not nodes all nodes will be

922
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,910
computing and actually what are the

923
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:53,819
incentives to add this stuff in the

924
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:59,790
network so that new services and

925
00:49:53,819 --> 00:50:02,130
implementers know that it exists so

926
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:04,920
what's the commonality I said we looked

927
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:07,230
at it so we want to select a programming

928
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,359
paradigm we want to marshal the

929
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:11,730
resources obviously we'll need to meet

930
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,440
requirements constraint and policies

931
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:15,569
have been working a lot in IOT and

932
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,410
sensor networks recently and there's a

933
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:21,329
lot of constraints there we want to be

934
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:23,759
adapt to changing condition leverage

935
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:26,309
telemetry and again this was very much

936
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,109
highlighted this morning these ideas of

937
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:30,089
the security the privacy and the trust

938
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:33,540
guarantees we have to be able to trust

939
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:35,910
the elements that do the computing we've

940
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:39,240
been very lucky we've been there for one

941
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:43,290
year and we have tons of people who

942
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,819
contributed drafts to the group and it

943
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,200
covers if you look at this accept

944
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:48,359
security which somebody again

945
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,799
highlighted this morning all these

946
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:52,558
drafts cover a lot of what we're

947
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:55,140
interested in augmented reality data

948
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:57,150
discovery managed networks app centers

949
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,220
industrial use cases which is also one

950
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:04,770
of my big thing requirements which is

951
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:07,049
intro and the transport issues how are

952
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:09,270
things when you look at end to end with

953
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:11,579
encryption or even end-to-end principles

954
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:13,500
and you want to start syncing computing

955
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:16,049
element in between how do you deal with

956
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,930
that and that's actually a big question

957
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:22,890
that we have so this is I would like you

958
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:24,540
to join us Friday and I think we're all

959
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,980
very passionate about this we think

960
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,390
there's really cool stuff that we can do

961
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:30,780
and we hope you can join us in our

962
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:32,940
sandbox thank you very much thank you

963
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:35,309
Murray has a so anyone have any

964
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,730
questions on this any questions or

965
00:51:35,309 --> 00:51:37,730
comments

966
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,310
either I was great than you guys are

967
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,680
completely stunned or I was terrible in

968
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:52,680
you're all asleep thank you anyway thank

969
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:54,839
you thank you so there's some really

970
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,910
interesting work in the coin groups of

971
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,040
please do consider joining them on

972
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:08,250
Friday I'm assuming you're all still

973
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:09,960
here on Friday all right so what we'd

974
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,840
like to do for the rest of this meeting

975
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,080
is spend a little bit of time thinking

976
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:18,990
about the relationship between the IRT F

977
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:22,140
and the ietf and discussing some of the

978
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:25,859
the ways in which the two organizations

979
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:29,400
can interact and move work between the

980
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,770
two organizations and so on I think we

981
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,680
have a Melinda first a little bit about

982
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:35,970
the relationship between the two all

983
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:45,540
right I don't have any slides is that

984
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:47,040
right and we Trent yeah yeah we'd like

985
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,830
this to be interactive so if you have

986
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:58,950
any opinions please do jump up at the

987
00:52:49,830 --> 00:53:01,529
mic actually the more I thought about

988
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:05,790
this recently the the softer my opinions

989
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:07,890
became or squishier they became bright

990
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:12,480
so no slides and I apologize for that

991
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:15,600
but only a little bit yeah so last

992
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,140
August there was a workshop on advanced

993
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:20,970
cryptography standardization and REO

994
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:25,560
lobby I don't know if he's here or not

995
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:29,850
gave a talk need to stand closer okay

996
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:33,870
yeah Bobby gave a very good talk on work

997
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:35,819
being done in the CFR G and yeah it was

998
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:38,880
definitely worth listening to if you're

999
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:44,070
curious about how to how to write crypto

1000
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:46,920
algorithm specifications but anyway he

1001
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:49,530
was he was sort of he was sort of

1002
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,860
confused about what the CFI G does and

1003
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,930
release

1004
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,880
the standards and what the RER actually

1005
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:58,140
F does and yours understands and he's

1006
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:59,910
someone who is active at it so when

1007
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,430
thinking about it you know I think that

1008
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:05,069
the way I RT F research groups are

1009
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:07,259
increasingly functioning is blurring the

1010
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,750
lines between the IRT F in the IETF they

1011
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,000
the way that meetings happen and the way

1012
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:15,330
the documents are handled are signaling

1013
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,970
that what's going on in IRT F research

1014
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:23,880
groups is actually standards related and

1015
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:27,120
that it is IETF related so I took a look

1016
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,160
at 74 18 Thank You Spencer that was it's

1017
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,750
a great document but it was written five

1018
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:32,759
years ago and it was raising some of the

1019
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:35,100
same questions in section two which is

1020
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,770
the the bulk of the document so there's

1021
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,630
like the IRT F is not the IETF and

1022
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,970
talked about some of these issues around

1023
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:47,900
how meetings are conducted how documents

1024
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:50,430
are progressed and and so on and so I

1025
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:53,880
think that as research groups are

1026
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:55,500
meeting more often with the IETF we're

1027
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,420
adopting more and more of the IETF

1028
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,210
mechanisms and some of these things do

1029
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,790
include things like the use of internet

1030
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:06,570
drafts as documents rather than research

1031
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:09,779
papers the use of consensus based

1032
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:11,160
decision making the notion that we want

1033
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:13,290
to agree on something rather than

1034
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:17,069
necessarily supporting a diversity of

1035
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:19,920
opinions so so yeah so basically you

1036
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:23,910
know I the question is as this

1037
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,320
increasingly happens we I you know my

1038
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:27,299
feeling is that we need sort of need to

1039
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,400
accept things as they happen but I also

1040
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:31,860
think that we need to be careful to

1041
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:35,220
preserve what we care about in the idea

1042
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:38,820
the research orientation and and and

1043
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,819
continue our focus on producing so ideas

1044
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:43,860
and enlightenment rather than

1045
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:46,320
specifications and engineering this is

1046
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:49,650
showing up in research group proposed

1047
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,240
charters as well in particular and I and

1048
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:56,570
this is an area that I think could use a

1049
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:59,850
lot more focus so so that's basically it

1050
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:01,650
you know as Colin said this is a an

1051
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:03,060
opportunity for discussion and sharing

1052
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,800
opinions and

1053
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:07,230
trying to figure out how we want to go

1054
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:09,710
forward and whether or not there's

1055
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:13,260
anything that needs to change

1056
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:18,110
okay thank you to say

1057
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:18,110
anyone have any anything to raise oh

1058
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:27,839
good I am I'm no Kucha yes general I

1059
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:31,439
fully agree so we have to be careful not

1060
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:34,830
to develop a certain you know ossified

1061
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:39,240
model of doing our research in the eye

1062
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:41,990
at EF and also when we talk about what

1063
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,560
makes a eye at EF research group

1064
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:46,020
successful or what is a good

1065
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,440
relationship and so on

1066
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:51,630
of course it's it's nice if we can you

1067
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:58,080
know move some work to the ITF at some

1068
00:56:51,630 --> 00:57:00,990
point on the other hand it's on the

1069
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:03,120
other hand it's also valuable output if

1070
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:06,060
we you know are able to invalidate

1071
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,500
certain assumptions and for example able

1072
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,140
to say okay this actually doesn't make

1073
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:12,570
sense for the internet and maybe we

1074
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:18,330
exported but enough is enough

1075
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:20,010
and let's move on yes so fully agree we

1076
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:22,680
don't have to produce something which

1077
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:24,900
can go further we could you know we can

1078
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,240
explore something and say yeah we've

1079
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:31,530
done it

1080
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:35,370
hi Brian Trammell I was looking at the

1081
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:36,750
list of for the big research groups we

1082
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:38,850
have know and in school that we're

1083
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:40,680
almost all meeting and I think dinner he

1084
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,850
was also scheduled and then ended up

1085
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:45,600
getting be scheduled so we almost had

1086
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:46,920
all of the meeting here and one of the

1087
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,630
things that struck me about the Scopes

1088
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,430
of those is that they're they don't

1089
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:52,920
really overlap but there are a lot of

1090
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:54,990
places where you know there's kind of

1091
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,370
gray areas mainly between coin and some

1092
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:58,350
of the stuff that might come out of pan

1093
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:00,900
RV eventually and between coin and

1094
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:03,690
energy and you know all of these in T to

1095
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:07,200
T and part of like they're all kind of

1096
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:08,700
looking at the same sort of problems

1097
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,950
base which is what's next for the

1098
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:13,109
internet with an internet focus but from

1099
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:15,899
different perspectives that would not

1100
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,780
work at all in the ITF right like having

1101
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,130
two working groups or

1102
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:23,470
not exactly the same thing as an

1103
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:25,870
excellent way to annoy the iesg um V I

1104
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:31,209
hear a couple of Exeter actors laughing

1105
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:35,109
the the idea of the IRT F is sort of a

1106
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:36,820
lab for the ietf um I think you actually

1107
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,140
do you see it in the set of research

1108
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:41,580
groups that we have right now I really

1109
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:44,140
like um Derk suggestion right like so it

1110
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:47,140
actually was I'm really jet white one of

1111
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,759
the two of you just said this um about

1112
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,109
like hey we have to we have to be a

1113
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,180
little bit bolder about allowing things

1114
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,380
to fail right like so or like you know

1115
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,899
let's spend it up and let's have a look

1116
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,550
at it and the the idea that the success

1117
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,780
is something's going to come out of this

1118
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,160
is gonna go into standardisation

1119
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:02,320
shouldn't be the goal and maybe I'm just

1120
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,830
saying that because I'm a co-chair of

1121
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:08,260
energy which has like a very very very

1122
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:10,150
long time scale for anything that might

1123
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:15,220
ever come out of that and be standards

1124
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:17,260
free um so yeah I think the the let's

1125
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:19,540
keep throwing things at the wall and see

1126
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:22,180
what sticks model works pretty well I

1127
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,750
think we've done a pretty good job of

1128
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:28,200
avoiding an anti-pattern that that may

1129
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:32,560
have showed up at the past that was um

1130
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,680
you know be an a research group as your

1131
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,450
consolation prize for a failed ball I

1132
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:39,520
think continuing to push back on God

1133
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:43,480
anti-pattern as a good and I also say

1134
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:45,759
that as a co-chair the energy um the the

1135
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:49,510
I think pushing back of identi pattern

1136
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,830
is a good continue doing so um yeah I

1137
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:58,710
think we're actually doing a pretty

1138
00:59:50,830 --> 01:00:01,120
reasonable job here launched a video I

1139
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:04,870
think this is a very important question

1140
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:07,470
to for the I got CF and I each you have

1141
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:10,029
to discuss maybe we can also consider

1142
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:12,009
not necessarily already the stage where

1143
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:14,260
there is a research group being proposed

1144
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:17,050
but more there is a research question or

1145
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:20,320
a research topic and how and where it

1146
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:23,200
could be addressed I mean maybe is RDF

1147
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:24,880
an IETF of some ways of seeing the world

1148
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,580
or approach programs but they may be

1149
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,940
also wider scope

1150
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:32,490
if we think IT OT h see other groups or

1151
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:34,620
even I mean other organization not the

1152
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:37,109
saliste are not related may also be

1153
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:38,850
other opportunities to the stage of the

1154
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:41,070
lifecycle of a research idea or research

1155
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,259
proposal can go through different groups

1156
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:46,950
and be marshal at some stage and then

1157
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:49,170
may be brought up to the IHF and maybe

1158
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,419
goes somewhere else so I will consider

1159
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:53,340
very important area if I eat you but

1160
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,590
maybe also try to widen a bit the scope

1161
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:57,390
because they may be ordered groups or

1162
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:59,910
stakeholders I could have good views or

1163
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:03,410
good competency in progressing a

1164
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:07,020
research idea in the overall ecosystem

1165
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:08,609
yeah I mean suddenly lots of the

1166
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:10,950
research groups have historically had

1167
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:14,220
pretty close links to academic

1168
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:15,419
conferences in the area and I guess the

1169
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:18,540
network management group would be one of

1170
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:20,490
them but certainly not the only one the

1171
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:22,470
quantum internet group I think has

1172
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:28,919
recently closed interactions with some

1173
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:31,910
of the conference's in that space - hi

1174
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,740
Steven Farrell so I think one of the

1175
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:36,870
does there's lots of good aspects of

1176
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,540
theory I've been close to the IETF one

1177
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:42,240
of the less good aspects I think is that

1178
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:46,259
research group chairs find it hard to

1179
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,459
deal with a lack of consensus in the ITF

1180
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,930
we're looking for rough consensus I

1181
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,420
don't that doesn't need to be the case

1182
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:53,819
in research groups but I think more and

1183
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:57,090
more it seems like there's a tendency to

1184
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:59,490
try and you know reach the same bar of

1185
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:01,280
rough consensus whereas I think research

1186
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:04,140
groups would sometimes be better

1187
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,390
publishing something that's whether it's

1188
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:08,370
a draft or an RFC interim this is this

1189
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:09,420
person's opinion most of all people

1190
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,670
don't agree with it but it still is

1191
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,530
opinion I think it would be good if

1192
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:17,310
research groups are more encouraged to

1193
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:19,380
allow that kind of lack of consensus yes

1194
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:21,150
I think that's a very good point you do

1195
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,890
not need research group consensus to

1196
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:25,050
publish an RFC you need to have an

1197
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:27,330
interesting document which the group

1198
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:28,650
thinks is worth publishing and the IRS G

1199
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:30,900
agrees

1200
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:33,210
and you know as long as it's clear that

1201
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:35,790
this is an opinion piece rather than a

1202
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:37,140
consensus piece that's just fine yeah

1203
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:41,870
maybe maybe it needs a bit more

1204
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:46,319
encouragement yeah you know equally

1205
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:48,330
research groups and not are not

1206
01:02:46,320 --> 01:03:01,980
evaluated based on the number of RFC's

1207
01:02:48,330 --> 01:03:05,220
they produce tall people right on wow I

1208
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:08,210
forgot what I was going to say oh I did

1209
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:08,209
forget anything

1210
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:18,710
gen-i anger so I want a second what

1211
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:21,930
Steven said I think it's valuable for

1212
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:26,490
parity of research groups to recognize

1213
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:28,890
that the processes of the IETF might be

1214
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:30,720
convenient because they are familiar but

1215
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:33,390
they're not necessary and we certainly

1216
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:38,359
shouldn't stick to them as though they

1217
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:41,609
are required I use I've just been

1218
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,200
considering how to as chair fic crg I've

1219
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:45,180
been trying to figure out how to publish

1220
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:47,399
documents in IC crg and what it means

1221
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:49,350
for us to publish documents in other in

1222
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,600
conversation with CFR G chairs and other

1223
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:53,730
folks and trying to understand that at

1224
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,640
the end of several long conversations

1225
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:59,160
the conclusion I came to was it doesn't

1226
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,319
 matter you do what you do and

1227
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,029
you publish something useful and

1228
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,130
ultimately whether it gets used or not

1229
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:09,420
is a function of a large number of

1230
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:11,160
things but our goal in IC c RG is to

1231
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:13,380
publish documents that are interesting

1232
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,620
that might be relevant and it's not so

1233
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:21,540
much to try and count with one right

1234
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:23,819
answer for various things so I I want to

1235
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:27,470
just take a moment to say that it's very

1236
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:30,060
useful I think for the IRT F to be

1237
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:33,509
associated with the IDF because it gives

1238
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:35,100
relevance it gives a space where we can

1239
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,410
understand problems from a practical

1240
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:39,779
point of view from what matters to the

1241
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:41,940
standards point of view at the same time

1242
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,540
I think it's also useful for the IRT

1243
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,820
have to be

1244
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:46,440
slightly independent of the IDF and to

1245
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:49,350
think of itself as independent from the

1246
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,880
IDF it doesn't need to be driven by IDF

1247
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:52,920
it doesn't need to be driven by things

1248
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,630
that will go back into the IETF or

1249
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:57,360
problems that are necessarily coming out

1250
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:58,980
of the IDF so it occupies an interesting

1251
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,330
space and in that I will just say one

1252
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:04,500
last thing which is it provides a venue

1253
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:07,200
it's not just the work that's happening

1254
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:10,230
in the research groups I see

1255
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:12,569
increasingly I see crg as a venue as a

1256
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:15,720
community where we are able to bring

1257
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:19,260
people in from from academia from the

1258
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:21,839
industry from standards areas I have

1259
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,550
people who come only for IC crg from the

1260
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,120
industry and they also happen to be in

1261
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:26,460
the IETF

1262
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:28,440
but that's that's what I want to foster

1263
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:30,690
I want to have that community be built

1264
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,370
and the community to be available so

1265
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:34,560
that when we actually have problems in

1266
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:38,390
the IETF that needs this community we

1267
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:38,390
have the community available on hand I

1268
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:47,850
remembered what I was going to say you

1269
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:50,759
know we've talked about the IRT F not

1270
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:53,940
being a forum for sort of advanced

1271
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:56,430
engineering within the IETF context but

1272
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:58,410
there does seem to be demand for that

1273
01:05:56,430 --> 01:06:01,140
activity to take place somewhere that

1274
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:02,970
IETF working groups are very very

1275
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,759
narrowly scoped they have very specific

1276
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:07,230
deliverables but often people and people

1277
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,070
want to talk about engineering problems

1278
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:13,680
more broadly and and because there is

1279
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:15,270
not any place for that within the IETF I

1280
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,140
think that tends to push that into the

1281
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:21,690
IRT up a bit and it's really not within

1282
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:24,150
the IRT have purview to deal with that

1283
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:25,410
but it is something that I think we

1284
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:29,700
might want to be talking about with the

1285
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:31,649
IETF yeah I think that's an important

1286
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:33,870
point the the the IETF works

1287
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,570
the IETF working groups are very

1288
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:39,120
narrowly scoped the IRT F is very blue

1289
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:41,070
sky and we've had a couple of

1290
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,470
discussions of you know that there's a

1291
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:46,650
gap in the middle and several people

1292
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:49,560
have mentioned this book on which I

1293
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:51,900
wanted to say the same thing and we can

1294
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,810
take an example of the network manager

1295
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:55,380
and research group and the net magnetic

1296
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,700
or

1297
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,560
you know where one

1298
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:00,060
is very detailed in the down to the bits

1299
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:04,560
and pieces and the other one is very

1300
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:07,049
blue sky and sometimes challenging some

1301
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:09,119
of the thinking about in a new framework

1302
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:11,670
your architecture how to do things that

1303
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,910
are being done in the ITF getting such

1304
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:17,310
feedback from the IRT F would be useful

1305
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:19,440
and trying to say hey guys stop working

1306
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:22,500
on something that has been 20 years as a

1307
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:24,480
general accepted concept try to think in

1308
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:26,070
the in this new terms and getting some

1309
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:31,619
of those new thoughts from the earth

1310
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:33,420
from the RDF would be helpful yes you

1311
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:35,730
know I suspect the scheduling could be

1312
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:38,630
made to work if people want so you know

1313
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:40,290
joint sessions to have these discussions

1314
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:44,369
hi

1315
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:46,980
this is Eve Schuler from Intel so I like

1316
01:07:44,369 --> 01:07:50,520
this discussion a lot so thank you for

1317
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:53,160
bringing it up I it points out to me at

1318
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:56,460
least that in some ways this discussion

1319
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:59,040
around relationships with ITF is around

1320
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:01,710
what's our metric for success in the IRT

1321
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:05,700
F and maybe one of the predominant ones

1322
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:07,380
is you know in forming the IETF but I it

1323
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,720
also raises the question or you know

1324
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:11,910
what are these other ones and some of

1325
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,410
the relationships that are spawning now

1326
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:16,559
among some of these other groups if you

1327
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:19,469
look at the research group thing to

1328
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,029
thing it has to do with sort of the

1329
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:22,859
broader community and many of the

1330
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:25,830
relationships with other standards

1331
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:28,680
bodies and so it just got me thinking

1332
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:29,969
about metrics of success and best known

1333
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,910
methods and things like that and I

1334
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:35,910
wonder if collectively as a research

1335
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:38,488
community within the IETF we can

1336
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:41,160
catalogue some of those and share some

1337
01:08:38,488 --> 01:08:43,040
of those in terms of like what are our

1338
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:46,769
objectives as a community and then

1339
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:51,479
ultimately help the IETF more so just

1340
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:53,460
thinking out loud and recognizing that

1341
01:08:51,479 --> 01:08:56,189
there there are more metrics to success

1342
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,080
beyond simply the relationship with the

1343
01:08:56,189 --> 01:09:00,790
idea

1344
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:04,330
yes yes I mean I think that is certainly

1345
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:06,870
true and you a research group does not

1346
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:09,189
is not necessarily expected to produce

1347
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:13,660
anything which would be useful to the

1348
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:15,759
IETF yes that is there to understand the

1349
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:20,500
problem space its length there to have

1350
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:23,830
to explore some ideas produce some new

1351
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:25,960
knowledge and occasionally that is that

1352
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:29,769
leads to that leads the group to a place

1353
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:31,660
where another effort can be spun up in

1354
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:33,640
the IETF to then standardize something

1355
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:36,580
based on that outcome but that's that's

1356
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:38,770
not necessarily that the metric for

1357
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:44,290
success although it's a metric for

1358
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:46,450
success and yeah just just understanding

1359
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:49,180
a problem better producing a bunch of

1360
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:50,769
papers producing a bunch of PhDs it's a

1361
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:58,180
perfectly reasonable successful outcome

1362
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:59,950
for a research group so I think the

1363
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:03,250
points I would like to highlight though

1364
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:05,559
as a research group don't feel that you

1365
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:08,740
have to follow the ITF process don't

1366
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:11,230
feel you have to have consensus it's

1367
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:12,820
often convenient to meet here yeah and

1368
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:15,339
that there's good reasons to meet

1369
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:16,630
co-located with the IAE TF because it

1370
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,770
gets some nice discussions and

1371
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:19,510
interactions with the standards

1372
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:23,770
community and with the people building

1373
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:26,140
products but meeting other places you

1374
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:28,900
meet with conferences meet up have

1375
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:32,710
workshops do whatever helps advance your

1376
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:35,980
research I'm sure Allison will remember

1377
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:37,660
that some years ago seem to remember the

1378
01:10:35,980 --> 01:10:39,969
reliable multicast group meeting on the

1379
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:41,920
beach Inc and next to the sitcom

1380
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:43,450
conference so we can meet it we can meet

1381
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,850
in all sorts of places it doesn't just

1382
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:53,530
have to be in a windowless meeting room

1383
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:56,320
next to an ITF meeting - mark I think

1384
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:59,920
actually that's very interesting remark

1385
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:03,400
because this also promotes the IETF in

1386
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:06,670
those other places so we talked a lot

1387
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:09,759
about how the IRT F maybe can contribute

1388
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:11,670
to the IETF but let's not forget that

1389
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,850
there's also another way around so

1390
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:18,090
there's that this is an opportunity to

1391
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:20,660
maybe get new people interested in what

1392
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:23,340
we are doing within the ITF as well so

1393
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:27,540
thank you for the you remark yes it's

1394
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:30,239
it's it's a way of fostering discussion

1395
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:32,820
between the the industrial side and the

1396
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:38,489
very academic side that's a very nice

1397
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:58,190
Rolly I ask all rights next up is is it

1398
01:11:38,489 --> 01:12:03,178
Erin all around that much on the side

1399
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:04,549
the other side there we go okay we've

1400
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:08,489
got most of the slide up

1401
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:11,520
Ansem okay hi I'm Erin fog whoops

1402
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:15,928
slides gone I can't talk without the

1403
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,880
notes so before Colin was I OTF chair

1404
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:19,650
and before Allison was I RTF cheering

1405
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:24,540
before Lars was i RTF chair for about

1406
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:29,370
six years I was I or TF chair and Colin

1407
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:33,630
asked me to and Laurent to work together

1408
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:37,830
to prompt some discussion on examples of

1409
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:41,010
IRT F ITF collaboration and so this is

1410
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:43,469
mostly one person's opinion maybe folks

1411
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:45,030
will disagree with some of these but I

1412
01:12:43,469 --> 01:12:47,210
think there's a lot of different models

1413
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:49,559
that are represented on this slide of

1414
01:12:47,210 --> 01:12:51,179
things that I think work well and some

1415
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:56,310
things I think are anti patterns and

1416
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:59,120
some which might or might not be good

1417
01:12:56,310 --> 01:13:01,560
parents some of you know probably more

1418
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:04,140
some cases I'm unsure in some cases I

1419
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,370
just don't know enough but so let me

1420
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,199
just walk through a few of these and

1421
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,610
maybe folks can add to them or come up

1422
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,678
with some other examples I think that

1423
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:13,500
the more that we can share best

1424
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:16,800
practices of how I RT F ITF

1425
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:19,770
collaboration works well the better it's

1426
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,210
going to be and you'll notice and the

1427
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:23,760
arrows don't always point in one

1428
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:27,410
direction so

1429
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:32,070
I think a good recent example is the ICC

1430
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:33,389
NRG the congestion control I think I

1431
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:37,349
have an extra layer the congestion

1432
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:38,610
control research group says I got it

1433
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:41,130
wrong but the congestion control

1434
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:43,349
research group has performed a valuable

1435
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:45,150
role in vetting congestion control

1436
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:48,660
proposals there was a time when people

1437
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:50,790
would bring their research project in

1438
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:55,380
congestion control to the IETF and ask

1439
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:57,450
them to ask us to put it into TCP which

1440
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:01,320
has a number of fallacies in it

1441
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:02,610
one of which the ITF doesn't standardize

1442
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,490
condition control or at least it didn't

1443
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:08,519
then I guess it's more than that now but

1444
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:11,190
also that there wasn't really the

1445
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,440
there's a lot of questions in terms of

1446
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:18,120
how things are going to work in the real

1447
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:19,230
world before you start to take position

1448
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,730
as to whether it's something that you

1449
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:25,980
want to roll that into the Internet and

1450
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:27,629
so that this research group was created

1451
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:29,250
in one of the valuable functions that

1452
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,480
they did was to bring together

1453
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:32,130
researchers who were familiar with

1454
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,889
congestion control and research in that

1455
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:37,980
area to evaluate proposals and then make

1456
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:40,770
some recommendations as to whether ITF

1457
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:43,290
protocols should support it a different

1458
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:46,440
example is in the delay tolerant

1459
01:14:43,290 --> 01:14:48,810
networking folks this was a fairly large

1460
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:51,570
research project multi-institution

1461
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:54,540
research project who wanted to see the

1462
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:56,700
protocols become standardized but there

1463
01:14:54,540 --> 01:15:01,260
are a bunch of open issues and so a

1464
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:04,800
research group was created to to come up

1465
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:07,080
with it could kind of sort through what

1466
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,350
the research community had done and

1467
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:12,690
implemented and and out of that came

1468
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:14,370
some proposals for standardization and

1469
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:18,030
working a working group was upon up to

1470
01:15:14,370 --> 01:15:19,500
standardize that so that was I guess

1471
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:22,530
that's a little bit more of a one-way or

1472
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:24,060
I guess maybe Stevie was there were

1473
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:25,620
there things that came out of the ITF

1474
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,270
working group that fed back into the

1475
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:30,330
research group No okay so how's one

1476
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:33,900
layer oh great network management

1477
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:36,090
research group I guess Laura can commit

1478
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:40,110
to this was a

1479
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:43,670
the proposals through there became part

1480
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:45,420
of the anima working group and the ITF

1481
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:47,600
see if our gee I think we've already

1482
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:50,820
talked about a little bit that it

1483
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,830
prefers together a bunch of folks from

1484
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:54,929
the crypto community who aren't

1485
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:58,710
naturally participants in the ITF

1486
01:15:54,930 --> 01:16:01,260
process who evaluate cryptographic

1487
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:04,710
proposals and make some recommendations

1488
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:08,699
that the ITF can then use to to evaluate

1489
01:16:04,710 --> 01:16:09,870
protocols and so the I guess the way

1490
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:11,339
that I understand the security area

1491
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:14,640
works is they there's sort of a

1492
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:16,380
deference to the CFR g2 to give like a

1493
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,780
thumbs up or thumbs down on crypto

1494
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:20,820
proposals and so that's that's sort of a

1495
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:22,199
you know bringing in in an area of

1496
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:24,840
expertise that isn't really present in

1497
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:28,040
the ITF but the ITF relies on quality in

1498
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:30,390
that area and so that's sort of a a

1499
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:32,340
little bit like the the congestion

1500
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:33,960
control idea

1501
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,000
there seems to be a couple of groups

1502
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,910
where there's that there's a bunch of

1503
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,440
expertise in the research community

1504
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:42,840
which developer you know interesting

1505
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:45,000
ideas whether that's congestion control

1506
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:48,090
log or crypto and demonstrate that they

1507
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:51,030
work and then the ITF groups say yeah

1508
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:52,560
that's useful to us so I think it's a

1509
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,940
maybe a little more nuanced than that

1510
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,469
that in some cases if they're coming up

1511
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:57,809
with ideas I think in this case like see

1512
01:16:55,469 --> 01:17:01,140
if Archie is there evaluating proposals

1513
01:16:57,810 --> 01:17:04,290
that come from outside so if you so

1514
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:07,040
there's a vetting process that requires

1515
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:10,860
expertise that isn't present in the IETF

1516
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:13,050
yeah there's a if I remember right they

1517
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:16,739
seem to run a bunch of competitions we

1518
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:18,270
want an algorithm to do this and some

1519
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:22,440
proposals come in and they evaluate them

1520
01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:29,550
figure out which ones work yeah reliable

1521
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:33,660
multicast is a fairly old or long-lived

1522
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:35,730
activity in the ITF and I think that's a

1523
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:37,739
that's an example of research that

1524
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:42,089
turned into some standardization didn't

1525
01:17:37,739 --> 01:17:44,790
solve all the problems but there's some

1526
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:48,590
protocol work that came out of it there

1527
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:48,590
the peer to peer research group

1528
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:55,099
was kind of had a whole burst of energy

1529
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:57,769
I think that came out of some issues in

1530
01:17:55,099 --> 01:18:00,190
industry and then the research group was

1531
01:17:57,769 --> 01:18:02,690
trying to come up with metrics for

1532
01:18:00,190 --> 01:18:04,190
evaluating aspects of your protocols and

1533
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:05,299
then the the outside working group came

1534
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:09,440
out of that so these are I think these

1535
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:10,550
are different kinds of success some let

1536
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,659
me go the anti-patterns and then I'll

1537
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,159
come back to the uncertain ones and

1538
01:18:11,659 --> 01:18:15,530
maybe that that'll be the start of some

1539
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:19,940
discussions so the nameservers research

1540
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:23,599
group was kind of winding down when I

1541
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:26,419
came into the IRT F but for a long time

1542
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:29,150
I had heard like that you know

1543
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:31,670
next-generation DNS is happening in this

1544
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:33,710
research group in the research group was

1545
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:35,150
closed and never actually published

1546
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:37,130
anything and so I think that's an

1547
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:41,869
example of where nothing came into the

1548
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:45,969
IETF and so that wasn't a very effective

1549
01:18:41,869 --> 01:18:48,259
way of collaboration you know that's

1550
01:18:45,969 --> 01:18:49,730
like we said in the last session that's

1551
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:52,250
not always the objective of a research

1552
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:54,829
group but I think and I think there

1553
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:57,260
there was a bunch of proposals that went

1554
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:58,280
into the ITF and then we redirected into

1555
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:00,050
this research group and then nothing

1556
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,849
came back so I think that that probably

1557
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:05,000
was a little bit of a swing and a miss

1558
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:08,599
for the organization anti-spam research

1559
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:10,699
group I think that there there were

1560
01:19:08,599 --> 01:19:11,900
hopes that there would be proposals for

1561
01:19:10,699 --> 01:19:17,419
how to deal with spam that came out of

1562
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:19,789
this group I think that very little ITF

1563
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:21,320
activity actually took off from that I'm

1564
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:25,099
happy to be corrective and I'm looking

1565
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:29,840
at Stephen I don't know all right so not

1566
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:31,130
you so uncertain hip was I think an

1567
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,489
interesting ITF activity there was a

1568
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:37,940
bunch of energy in the hallways to

1569
01:19:33,489 --> 01:19:40,669
implement hip hip was a proposed as an

1570
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:42,379
alternative architecture for addressing

1571
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:48,739
a bunch of problems at the time in the

1572
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:51,440
ITF and they tried a few boss to get

1573
01:19:48,739 --> 01:19:54,018
work going in the ITF I think that that

1574
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:56,058
was my opinion as it was proposed as a

1575
01:19:54,019 --> 01:19:58,670
little bit too sweeping in terms of what

1576
01:19:56,059 --> 01:20:00,019
they were trying to accomplish in for

1577
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,110
that reasons that sort of bounced off

1578
01:20:00,019 --> 01:20:02,190
that you know we

1579
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,690
Charter working groups if we think that

1580
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:05,699
they're focused and they're gonna you

1581
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:07,469
know have narrow goals and accomplish

1582
01:20:05,699 --> 01:20:10,320
those goals in a in a reasonable amount

1583
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:14,630
of time and so then they became a

1584
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:17,159
research group and I think that it

1585
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:18,389
there's been some people implementation

1586
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:20,549
but I don't think it had the deployment

1587
01:20:18,389 --> 01:20:22,530
that they had hoped for do you want

1588
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:24,420
comment now listen are we yeah I'd like

1589
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:26,610
it if you define uncertain because

1590
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:30,270
you're starting uncertain with hip

1591
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:31,589
saying didn't really succeed and when

1592
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:34,409
you and I had a little exchange about

1593
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:37,290
this in the email I'm Allison Macon it

1594
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:42,989
was you said it didn't really mean that

1595
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:45,690
so well so my feeling is that this is a

1596
01:20:42,989 --> 01:20:49,678
that this characterization is I'm

1597
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:52,919
uncertain about it to me it is isn't is

1598
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:55,830
not obviously a good example or a bad

1599
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:57,840
example of IR TF ITF collaboration and

1600
01:20:55,830 --> 01:21:01,170
so I think it's a little bit of a mixed

1601
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:03,239
bag so I feel like hip I don't think

1602
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:04,710
it's a clear example of like it working

1603
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:08,879
really well

1604
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:10,710
and but it is in the example of

1605
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,840
something that was sort of there was

1606
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:14,310
stuff happening in the ITF and in the IR

1607
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,199
tip so there was some collaboration so

1608
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:18,239
I'm uncertain as to whether I would call

1609
01:21:16,199 --> 01:21:20,250
it a good example or necessarily

1610
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:23,459
something that we should an anti-pattern

1611
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:27,330
so that's I'm gonna stay at the mic ok

1612
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:31,469
great so the routing Research Group is

1613
01:21:27,330 --> 01:21:32,400
this is a when I came in to the ITF

1614
01:21:31,469 --> 01:21:34,350
they're out on you search group had been

1615
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:37,440
around for a long time

1616
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:40,230
and I think that it it was not a good

1617
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:42,960
example of collaboration in that what I

1618
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:44,400
saw of it was that proposals that the

1619
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:48,080
ITF didn't want to deal with were

1620
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:50,820
redirected to the routing research group

1621
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:54,360
oftentimes that they would just not come

1622
01:21:50,820 --> 01:22:01,409
to the ITF the end end research group

1623
01:21:54,360 --> 01:22:03,150
and I think is I oh so I put this in the

1624
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:04,920
worked well column based on your

1625
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:06,929
comments and I think that Colin didn't

1626
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,429
get my updated slides so let me let me

1627
01:22:06,929 --> 01:22:11,550
speak as if it was in the worked well

1628
01:22:08,429 --> 01:22:12,929
column because your comment I was

1629
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,970
persuaded by your earlier comment

1630
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:16,280
Allison

1631
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:18,050
that it was it was an example of a bunch

1632
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:23,990
of research activity that found its way

1633
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:27,140
into the IETF in I think a less it was a

1634
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:31,880
much longer lived research activity and

1635
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:33,500
so is it less sort of not the same kind

1636
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:36,200
of example of something that was focused

1637
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:37,310
like DTN but something where there was a

1638
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,190
you knows a lot of research that

1639
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:42,680
happened over time it was a close

1640
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:44,150
research group and so it was kind of

1641
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:45,680
indirect and how things came out of the

1642
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:46,969
research group and into the IETF there

1643
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:48,310
were a few examples of drafts but there

1644
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:50,420
were also research papers and

1645
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:51,980
implementation projects that came in and

1646
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:53,420
so it's a very different animal than

1647
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,559
some of the other stuff in the left-hand

1648
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:58,850
column but I do think it's a good

1649
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:07,010
example of of the collaboration and then

1650
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:09,320
the qyrg it was a very open-ended and so

1651
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:12,430
qrg I put in here because it's new it's

1652
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:15,559
uncertain but I think that it's a so I

1653
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:19,220
don't want to say yet that it's it is a

1654
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:20,210
great example of of AI RTF IETF

1655
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,490
collaboration because there's really

1656
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:24,380
been very little IETF activity except

1657
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:26,690
for the fact that there was a gir G

1658
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:29,600
tutorial which was very popular and so

1659
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:34,070
if you want to look for a different kind

1660
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:36,620
of pattern of ITF I RTF collaboration a

1661
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:39,019
sort of an education approach of like

1662
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:43,040
here's an interesting research area that

1663
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:46,160
is related to networking and and may

1664
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:49,850
have eventually activities in the IETF

1665
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:51,380
but in the in the near term is a source

1666
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:52,760
of information and educating and sort of

1667
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:55,070
raising the clew level and ITF

1668
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,320
participants then I think Qi RG is sort

1669
01:23:55,070 --> 01:24:02,299
of an interesting example of that so at

1670
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:05,870
this point the one thing I would want to

1671
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:08,420
add this and and it really did it was a

1672
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:11,330
task force before and it was a peer of

1673
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:14,270
the ITF so it was a different animal

1674
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:15,170
indeed when it first started out and for

1675
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:18,050
like 20 years

1676
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:20,150
but to be you know clearly people who

1677
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:23,210
might not know it incubated our entire

1678
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:26,120
media you know if the internet media

1679
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:27,690
protocols it incubated diffserv and

1680
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,059
incubated

1681
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:32,849
ecn all kinds of stuff that we wouldn't

1682
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:34,740
have without it so what kind of thing

1683
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:37,770
could be like that in future I'm not

1684
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:41,160
sure maybe nothing but it was actually

1685
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:43,050
very high impact on the ITF just quite

1686
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:52,080
different from the research groups we

1687
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:53,760
have now yep I still card I have to kind

1688
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,820
of agree with your characterization of

1689
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:59,310
hip in terms of a burst of promising

1690
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:02,280
activity and then a long dormant period

1691
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:04,470
but I would like to say that the rumor

1692
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:07,469
of hips death is greatly exaggerated and

1693
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:10,590
I think the reason that it may not have

1694
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:12,660
been a poster child for IR TF a ATF

1695
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:15,270
transition is that perhaps it

1696
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:18,809
transitioned a little early before there

1697
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:22,200
was a clear application pole for the

1698
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:25,020
technology but the the trustworthy

1699
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:28,950
multipath remote identification baath

1700
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:31,680
tomorrow morning is an application pole

1701
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:35,580
for which we think hip is actually an

1702
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:39,650
excellent fit hip in our time very

1703
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:43,860
exciting Christian mission we tomorrow

1704
01:25:39,650 --> 01:25:46,370
on at the time there was some research

1705
01:25:43,860 --> 01:25:50,670
group that were closed membership and

1706
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:53,160
some that were open did you observe any

1707
01:25:50,670 --> 01:25:55,530
kind of relation between the fact that

1708
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:59,309
something was closed and its success or

1709
01:25:55,530 --> 01:26:02,190
not well two of the groups on here the

1710
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:04,430
only two that I know of a closed groups

1711
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:08,669
are on this list so the named

1712
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:09,750
nameservers research group and srg I

1713
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:12,450
can't remember if names to resist the

1714
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:15,120
credit correct expansion but the names

1715
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:16,710
research group was closed and then also

1716
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,970
end end research group was closed and so

1717
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:19,680
I think we've got both sort of a

1718
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:23,370
positive and a negative example so I

1719
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:24,750
don't think we can draw conclusions also

1720
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:26,340
that this is pretty far back I don't

1721
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:29,060
think that there have been any closed

1722
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:34,610
research groups in recent memory

1723
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:36,390
everybody's shaking their head so but

1724
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:38,280
Christian you raised a point that I

1725
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:40,500
wanted to make earlier on in the in the

1726
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:44,099
discussion of the last section which is

1727
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:45,810
there's an enormity F is very very

1728
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:47,760
constrained process because we want to

1729
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:49,800
be open transparent and standards

1730
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,600
organization the IR TIF has none of that

1731
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,250
and there's a lot of flexibility in how

1732
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,590
research groups about can operate and

1733
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:57,840
the and that discretion is typically

1734
01:26:55,590 --> 01:27:00,180
given to the research group chair to

1735
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,610
organize it in a way that you know keeps

1736
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:06,840
the energy up and accomplishes stuff and

1737
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:08,820
so well making a group closed is one

1738
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,410
aspect of that but there but meeting in

1739
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:12,030
other locations is another piece of that

1740
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:14,309
and I don't know if it's still the case

1741
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:15,450
but but it was for a while the only

1742
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:17,880
requirement was that you should meet

1743
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:19,559
once a year at an ITF meeting to promote

1744
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,030
some collaboration and cross

1745
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:22,050
fertilization of ideas but other than

1746
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:25,700
that you can pretty much do what you

1747
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:28,530
want I think that's a great thing David

1748
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:30,870
so I was gonna comment on a couple of

1749
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:32,849
things first end-to-end is a closed

1750
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:35,849
research group is gonna leave people

1751
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:40,500
with the wrong impression it was closed

1752
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:43,910
in that membership and participation was

1753
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:47,670
by invitation only but the chairs were

1754
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:51,320
incredibly close in figuring out who to

1755
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:54,660
invite and reach out to and move forward

1756
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:55,620
so that there was quite a bit of the

1757
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,510
other thing was gonna do it I think it's

1758
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:59,130
probably mostly on you on your next

1759
01:27:57,510 --> 01:27:59,940
slide so you're going to get to that or

1760
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:01,260
do you want talking it wasn't actually

1761
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,940
gonna present prevent the next slide

1762
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:05,040
that was more sort of reflection on

1763
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:06,540
stuff and I thought that the discussion

1764
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,160
the reflection from the folks in the

1765
01:28:06,540 --> 01:28:09,900
room was probably more interesting than

1766
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,340
they so if I want to go to the next

1767
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:14,219
slide we can well have you got a gun see

1768
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:16,260
next slide I think the different forms

1769
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:18,420
of transfer is really insightful because

1770
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:20,810
what happened because you're the first

1771
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:23,370
bullet there basically is an incubation

1772
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:26,250
its pre standards and the goal is to

1773
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:28,950
spawn standards activity and a group

1774
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:30,810
that started that way needs to have the

1775
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:33,120
courage to say we've done the job we're

1776
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:37,010
getting out of business the second line

1777
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:41,880
is an area of overlapping expertise

1778
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:44,390
where for both ICC RG and CFR G you can

1779
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,860
identify a community of expertise

1780
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:49,110
strongly ground and research that is

1781
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:51,480
complementary to the standards work that

1782
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:54,130
we do here and that's a really good

1783
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:56,169
structure because it avoids inflicting

1784
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:57,670
the research on the protocol development

1785
01:28:56,170 --> 01:29:01,140
and the protocol developed

1786
01:28:57,670 --> 01:29:01,140
practicalities on the researchers

1787
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:05,590
Lawrence should get credit for making

1788
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,940
most of this slide since it's so

1789
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:08,160
insightful then I agree with the

1790
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:12,429
comments

1791
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:13,990
let's heard occur I say one other good

1792
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,280
thing that came out of it and when

1793
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:17,740
you're totally done I have a much longer

1794
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:19,389
thought train to expound upon for for

1795
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:21,940
both previous presentation and this one

1796
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:24,280
but the NMR G was also actually the

1797
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,620
route for not coffin yang and it was a a

1798
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:29,679
short-term model that you know certainly

1799
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:31,390
heavily affected the ATF today and you

1800
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:35,260
know it started as sort of a fairly

1801
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:37,000
short project of two to three years that

1802
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:38,980
it was too long to do in the IETF and

1803
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,840
and the research you know is the right

1804
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,580
place for it to start and then it

1805
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:44,860
certainly transformed a lot since then

1806
01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:47,170
but it's a great tech transition story

1807
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:51,070
thanks Wes I wasn't involved in that so

1808
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:57,640
it's helpful to know Spencer please

1809
01:29:51,070 --> 01:30:03,700
finish your slide I don't feel the need

1810
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:07,720
to say anything else ok this is de

1811
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:12,160
Varenne I you focused on a bunch of

1812
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:15,030
things in the IRT F that have had for

1813
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:16,809
better or worse interesting

1814
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:18,670
characteristics in their interaction

1815
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:20,890
with the ITF there there are a few of

1816
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:22,630
the things here where we also want to

1817
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:25,450
look at our failure models as well as

1818
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:27,640
our success models and I can think of at

1819
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:30,580
least a few research groups which I will

1820
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:32,830
not name um that were that wound up

1821
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:33,970
getting chartered and then we discovered

1822
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:37,900
that there actually weren't any

1823
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:41,710
interesting research problems and they

1824
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:43,299
bounced around for a while and they were

1825
01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:46,270
they couldn't produce a standard because

1826
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:48,310
they weren't in the ITF and yet we

1827
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:51,400
discovered that what was happening in

1828
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:52,720
those research groups wasn't research so

1829
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:56,799
one of the things I think we do need to

1830
01:30:52,720 --> 01:31:00,130
sort of guard against is allowing groups

1831
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:01,900
to keep going on and on and on with not

1832
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:03,790
understanding what the boundary is and

1833
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:06,129
there actually aren't any interesting

1834
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:06,950
research problems in that domain that

1835
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:09,290
could drive

1836
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:14,059
search agenda so just the word of

1837
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:15,950
caution there right so so I guess my

1838
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:18,980
first response to your comments is that

1839
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:21,559
that's none of the list for the

1840
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:25,040
discussion before the this is about IRT

1841
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:28,460
I fight if TSK collaboration but to

1842
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:30,410
respond to some of the groups which will

1843
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:31,910
go unnamed in facts were chartered

1844
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:33,620
because there were things that were

1845
01:31:31,910 --> 01:31:35,690
believed to be needed in the research

1846
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:38,269
community there weren't ready for the

1847
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:39,710
IETF to deal with and that kind of

1848
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:41,740
collaboration with the thought that

1849
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:44,390
things might transition in the IETF

1850
01:31:41,740 --> 01:31:47,660
were motivations for forming those

1851
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:49,460
groups so let me just reiterate my point

1852
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:52,880
there have to be interesting research

1853
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:55,010
problems independent of whether on the

1854
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:58,190
output is something that winds up in the

1855
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:59,240
IETF or not wait this this to some

1856
01:31:58,190 --> 01:32:03,559
extent is the difference between

1857
01:31:59,240 --> 01:32:05,150
research and development so we need to

1858
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,980
find interesting research problems not

1859
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:10,460
just interesting advanced development

1860
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:12,200
problems i well maybe you and I disagree

1861
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:14,030
on this but I think that there's room in

1862
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,590
the IRT F for both if there's an

1863
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:20,630
energized community that wants to work

1864
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:25,160
on it because I is again my personal

1865
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:27,730
opinion is that the IETF succeeds with

1866
01:32:25,160 --> 01:32:29,960
things that are pretty well defined and

1867
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:31,339
there are things that are not very

1868
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,830
research II that may need more

1869
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:36,590
definition I think having them happen in

1870
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:38,930
the IARC if is okay but that's different

1871
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:41,060
from so I think that there's a lot of

1872
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:45,830
different kinds of things that can grow

1873
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:47,270
in the AI RTF and I I think that I don't

1874
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:50,559
see a benefit to creating another

1875
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:54,280
organization to hold those things

1876
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:58,940
because sometimes it takes people with

1877
01:32:54,280 --> 01:33:01,719
you you know it's that research in an

1878
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:03,950
implementation collaboration that yeah

1879
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:05,510
this or the joint expertise that it

1880
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:08,179
takes to sort of get them over the line

1881
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:09,950
so they can be baked here something I

1882
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:11,840
don't disagree with they you know they

1883
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:14,540
don't always succeed I mean this the the

1884
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,850
list of concluded research groups for

1885
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:20,019
some value of concluded is much longer

1886
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:20,020
than the list of active ones

1887
01:33:20,250 --> 01:33:27,360
of course of course I think we need to

1888
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:29,429
be clear that there is that we believe

1889
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:33,360
there are research issues before we

1890
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:37,800
transfer a group and you you're the boss

1891
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:39,870
yeah yeah my view tends to be that if

1892
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:41,990
it's just that it could be engineering

1893
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:45,750
it's just a longer term focus than a

1894
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:47,849
typical IETF group to me that that

1895
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:51,750
should be a perhaps a difference at the

1896
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:52,890
IETF xrt I don't want to get into

1897
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:54,510
semantics on where you draw the line

1898
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:55,980
between research and engineering but I

1899
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:58,050
think it's I think it's hard to come up

1900
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:59,849
with an objective measure on what that

1901
01:33:58,050 --> 01:34:03,060
is there's always a bunch of things in a

1902
01:33:59,850 --> 01:34:05,490
gray area but ultimately the judgment on

1903
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:08,940
whether it's in or not is yours that's

1904
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:12,900
what comes somebody at the microphone

1905
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:17,250
say something yeah so Spencer Dawkins

1906
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:19,469
and I wanted to I wanted to thank Collin

1907
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:21,570
for putting this topic forward and Aaron

1908
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:24,320
for doing this presentation I wanted to

1909
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:28,590
cut down to your bottom bullet about

1910
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:30,690
documenting this topic more precisely it

1911
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:36,720
seems like to me that one of the things

1912
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:39,450
when we succeed in research groups at

1913
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:40,650
least some of the time we we do that by

1914
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:43,889
involving a lot of people that don't

1915
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:46,940
understand the IETF very well and that

1916
01:34:43,890 --> 01:34:49,050
means that it makes transition hard

1917
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:50,969
especially if they don't know what's

1918
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:56,280
been tried before and what has been

1919
01:34:50,970 --> 01:35:00,300
tried that has worked out badly back in

1920
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:04,410
the day not very long after Lars became

1921
01:35:00,300 --> 01:35:07,950
AI rkf chair he had me working on what

1922
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:11,670
became I think it's our C 74 18 that's

1923
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:14,790
the IRT F primer variety of participants

1924
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:17,720
in the problem we were shooting at back

1925
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:20,070
then was people coming from the IETF

1926
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:22,110
with you know the understanding of the

1927
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:24,030
IETF process and that's not the way the

1928
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:25,230
IRT F works and the thing I don't know

1929
01:35:24,030 --> 01:35:27,330
it's like I don't know eight or ten

1930
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:29,639
pages long something like that it's not

1931
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:32,250
it's not very long but it's like it has

1932
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,850
the list about you know scope and

1933
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:36,420
timeframe

1934
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:39,840
and you know participation and and

1935
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:41,040
meeting places and stuff like that but

1936
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,570
that was the problem that we were

1937
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:45,440
dealing with that was the problem the

1938
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:50,219
chair of the IRT F was dealing with that

1939
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:51,660
and it seems like to me that because we

1940
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:54,270
don't have the same research groups now

1941
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:56,760
and we don't have the same ITF and we

1942
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:58,290
don't have the same IRT of chair it

1943
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:02,070
seems like the problems that the IURC

1944
01:35:58,290 --> 01:36:04,769
have share is facing now is more the you

1945
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:06,929
know getting things slotted in the right

1946
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:10,010
place in the first you know the first

1947
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:13,380
balance so that it's not the fail Bluff

1948
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:19,550
consolation prize that people tried to

1949
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:23,210
make it and and and how you know just

1950
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:26,880
documenting what the models are you know

1951
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:29,670
DTE Energy basically kind of picked up

1952
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:33,900
stakes and move to the ietf you know

1953
01:36:29,670 --> 01:36:35,820
that's a model other people have bottles

1954
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:38,580
like ICC RG which is a completely

1955
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:41,160
different model I would I would caution

1956
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:44,640
against trying to make this very precise

1957
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:46,889
because the research groups are really

1958
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:48,480
this you know the scopes are big whether

1959
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:51,210
the we research groups are big or not

1960
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:53,070
and they're really different you know

1961
01:36:51,210 --> 01:36:55,620
and we don't have a lot of them to

1962
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:58,019
basement to base quite you know criteria

1963
01:36:55,620 --> 01:37:00,300
on but they're just even write down you

1964
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:01,860
know what is what happened in the past

1965
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:06,120
and how it turned out

1966
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:09,030
which is oddly the painter key draft on

1967
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:11,430
what not to do you know it's kind of

1968
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:13,380
doing for a path where networking but to

1969
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:29,610
basically do the same kind of thing for

1970
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:31,950
the IRT F and the IETF interaction did

1971
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:33,570
you take 10 minutes there's another

1972
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:36,690
couple of minutes we've got another Toby

1973
01:37:33,570 --> 01:37:38,429
all right and go on for 10 minutes so

1974
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:39,870
you know I think looking at both the

1975
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:41,130
last two talks right they're very

1976
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:43,080
informative and how do we think about

1977
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:45,150
the IRT F over the over the longer term

1978
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:46,559
and especially working groups and when

1979
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:47,790
they're successful and

1980
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,820
there's a real a challenge there because

1981
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:52,740
there's a width issue right IRT F groups

1982
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:55,380
need to span from you know far-reaching

1983
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:56,940
research that you know is looking out in

1984
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:59,180
far distant future just stuff that needs

1985
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:01,950
to transition you know fairly quickly

1986
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:04,410
and you actually specifically transition

1987
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:07,110
to application and real interoperability

1988
01:38:04,410 --> 01:38:10,559
and so you know you can look at results

1989
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:11,880
as you know we look to we measured this

1990
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,590
really cool thing we found out that

1991
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:16,500
nothing needs to change that's still a

1992
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:17,820
success right we've looked at a problem

1993
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,470
space and we found that there is a

1994
01:38:17,820 --> 01:38:21,809
problem we're creating new work or new

1995
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:23,760
working group out of it that's great and

1996
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:26,160
we have improvements and suggestions and

1997
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:29,700
that got transferred into you know into

1998
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:31,050
protocol changes you know on the wire so

1999
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:33,059
that's the easy thing but the thing is

2000
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:35,280
is the success possibilities for a

2001
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:37,260
research group are so wide that it might

2002
01:38:35,280 --> 01:38:39,269
actually be easier to look at what do we

2003
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:41,370
not want and so I have a couple of

2004
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:43,290
examples of that of which in you know

2005
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:44,610
research groups that that fail might

2006
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:46,530
include research groups that produce no

2007
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:49,259
documents I think you had an example of

2008
01:38:46,530 --> 01:38:51,349
that research groups that looked at a

2009
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:54,210
problem space found a solvable problem

2010
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:57,000
but failed to find an audience right

2011
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:58,680
where it just sort of fell on deaf ears

2012
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,110
and then that would be a problem and

2013
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:03,270
similarly you know deaf ears when you

2014
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:05,580
discover protocol deficiencies in

2015
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:08,340
existing stuff based on research that

2016
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:10,140
failed to actually transition to fixes

2017
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:12,540
and like actually they present the the

2018
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:13,860
winner presentation from today is a good

2019
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:16,320
example of that of trying to figure out

2020
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:18,000
where where can we get that fixed and if

2021
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,690
it doesn't get fixed that's to some

2022
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,410
extent a failure

2023
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:26,490
I would say the most insidious example

2024
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:31,370
of something that doesn't belong in the

2025
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:34,969
IRT F is a you know a particular company

2026
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:38,809
proposal that is trying to create

2027
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:41,460
something that looks like an open forum

2028
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:43,800
but doesn't have a constituency that I

2029
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:46,080
saw several examples of that when I was

2030
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:48,210
I our TF chair and I think that was the

2031
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,559
that it's like okay maybe there's

2032
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:51,420
interesting work here but it's just like

2033
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:53,190
your little narrow thing there's nobody

2034
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:54,360
who wants to collaborate with you and so

2035
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:56,610
we're not gonna create a group for you

2036
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:59,370
no matter how many people you have show

2037
01:39:56,610 --> 01:40:00,540
up so but I you know I think your

2038
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:04,559
examples are good as

2039
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:06,180
Eric yeah not mine so listening to you

2040
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:07,980
guys debating onstage sort of the

2041
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:10,080
boundary between research and advanced

2042
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:12,718
development I mean I think that there is

2043
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:15,570
this other space where what does the

2044
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:18,150
idft versus the IRT have when there's

2045
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:19,769
some new work coming in and people sort

2046
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:22,019
of have some vague notion that there

2047
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:23,820
might be something here but proponents

2048
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:28,770
don't seem to be able to describe it

2049
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:30,150
very well or sort of you know is is it

2050
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:32,550
because they don't understand the

2051
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:34,589
problem space the solution space the

2052
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:36,510
constituents but but it's rather vague

2053
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:39,390
right and those things get tossed around

2054
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:41,070
and sometimes might depend on an IRF

2055
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:42,780
chair is some of it might have landed in

2056
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:45,330
the Iron Chef

2057
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:49,170
other times the ad said worked with

2058
01:40:45,330 --> 01:40:50,730
these people for sometimes for many ITF

2059
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:51,570
meetings to try to sort of distill

2060
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:55,468
something out of it

2061
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:57,360
sometimes the IAB or an IB member gets

2062
01:40:55,469 --> 01:40:59,219
appointed as a shepherd to try to help

2063
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,960
them and maybe CID leads to barf or

2064
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:03,330
something but that's one of the

2065
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,370
challenging spaces were we believe that

2066
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:08,010
we want to be open and invite this new

2067
01:41:05,370 --> 01:41:10,110
work but but it's not necessarily that

2068
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:11,430
well formed and I'm not arguing that

2069
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:13,139
that should land in the i/o chair if

2070
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:15,810
it's just that we collectively should

2071
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:17,730
you sort of figure out a way of handling

2072
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:19,230
that I mean I supposed to it being

2073
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:20,489
passed around but I think that's an

2074
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:33,570
excellent point do you have a proposal

2075
01:41:20,489 --> 01:41:37,200
no time for it so just mention on the

2076
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:39,000
bottom to sub-bullets I think it's

2077
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:41,580
always good to like write things down

2078
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,350
but want to be careful to make sure that

2079
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:46,830
it doesn't become a requirement that all

2080
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:48,600
research must successfully transfer and

2081
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:51,210
the learnings I think if written from

2082
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:53,610
the ice see if our G side verts re from

2083
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:55,560
the research side versus the ietf side

2084
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:57,420
they might be very different which would

2085
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,950
also be interesting yeah it's a good

2086
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:01,380
point I should have added a column on my

2087
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:03,630
chart that was no transfer and it was

2088
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:04,710
still a great thing because there's a

2089
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:06,239
bunch of research groups especially

2090
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:09,700
they're active now that fall in that

2091
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:12,580
category okay thank you everybody

2092
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:14,080
yep so Thank You Aaron and yes to be

2093
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:16,900
clear that there is absolutely no

2094
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:20,620
requirement that anything transitions in

2095
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:23,019
standardization you know we as a

2096
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:26,160
research group you you know the idea is

2097
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:28,750
to develop some ideas some technology a

2098
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:30,519
group of people may look at the outcome

2099
01:42:28,750 --> 01:42:33,070
of a research group and say this is

2100
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:36,460
appropriate for standardizing they may

2101
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:54,610
not and it's a successful way as long as

2102
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:56,140
we learn something all right so having

2103
01:42:54,610 --> 01:42:59,950
spent some time talking about how the

2104
01:42:56,140 --> 01:43:02,320
IRT F and the IETF can interact a little

2105
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:06,970
bit about how the IRT F and the broader

2106
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:08,530
academia can interact hi it's me again

2107
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:10,840
and for the people who started hearing

2108
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:15,309
me at 7:15 this morning I promise it's

2109
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:17,620
the last night so this started I

2110
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:21,940
mentioned when I did the coin

2111
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:24,070
presentation that we had two interims

2112
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:26,799
and this discussion actually started

2113
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:28,960
that our last interim in October and we

2114
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,940
figured out that it was a topic that was

2115
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,920
much bigger than the research group it

2116
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:36,730
was something that was for the whole IRT

2117
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:39,280
F so I would like to thank everybody and

2118
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:41,190
the coin community Jana talked about

2119
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,780
communities well that's one of them and

2120
01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:46,059
especially Lars who sent us a set of

2121
01:43:43,780 --> 01:43:50,940
very interesting slides and actually I

2122
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:56,590
borrowed one so that were the comments

2123
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:58,960
academics do not do drafts good part

2124
01:43:56,590 --> 01:44:01,750
attendance from professors and students

2125
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,880
is often very difficult for questions of

2126
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:07,360
budgets and because you know we seem to

2127
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:10,900
be the roaming conference here and it's

2128
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:13,929
true you know it costs money we need to

2129
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:19,330
do a better job of connecting academia

2130
01:44:13,930 --> 01:44:21,310
and I RTF I agree the other inputs one

2131
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:23,440
of them was from Colin was that well

2132
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:28,239
there's more than drafts that

2133
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:31,449
is the ietf way of moving forward but

2134
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:33,519
maybe there's something else and maybe

2135
01:44:31,449 --> 01:44:37,120
the typical draft format is ill-suited

2136
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:40,570
for for research discussions and also

2137
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:43,630
the typical draft presentation format at

2138
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:46,389
a lot of IRT F meeting we would like to

2139
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:49,000
know the progress of the research or the

2140
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:52,120
new IDs in research not just the Delta

2141
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:55,840
from the last version of the of the

2142
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:57,730
draft so we decided that okay let's

2143
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,320
let's get some thoughts around this and

2144
01:44:57,730 --> 01:45:01,150
let's look also what happened in the

2145
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:03,460
past and I promise someone that was

2146
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:06,790
going to discuss this but a few years

2147
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:12,850
ago I was on an HDR evaluation in France

2148
01:45:06,790 --> 01:45:14,980
for somebody who had a nickel but a way

2149
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:17,380
of applying for this I didn't even know

2150
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:20,110
how we could say that this person was

2151
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:22,270
not going to get this and then one of

2152
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:26,349
the reviewers said but look at his

2153
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:30,400
publication record he's got eight RFC's

2154
01:45:26,350 --> 01:45:33,310
but not a lot of publications and my

2155
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:35,320
room you know my first thing was that

2156
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:37,480
he's got you know wow that's that's

2157
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:40,330
amazing and that if you think of the

2158
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:42,580
usual people who read a conference paper

2159
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:46,000
there's three think of how many people

2160
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:49,510
read a draft because before it becomes

2161
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:52,030
an RFC and the the amount of comments

2162
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:56,680
that you get from all kinds of people

2163
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:58,300
from all kinds of sources and you know I

2164
01:45:56,680 --> 01:46:01,330
thought it was amazing but it was

2165
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:03,820
actually highlighting a fact that in

2166
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:09,070
academia people do not really understand

2167
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:11,679
what a draft and what an RFC is so the

2168
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:13,780
top concerns was again that these draft

2169
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:15,850
and standardization in general but we're

2170
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:19,179
I or TF we don't do a standardization

2171
01:46:15,850 --> 01:46:21,310
but the drafts are poorly considered in

2172
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:23,920
academic circles well probably because

2173
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:25,989
people don't know what they are the

2174
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:28,150
other point was that we needed to have

2175
01:46:25,989 --> 01:46:30,759
more dissemination of the research group

2176
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:35,259
activities a lot of people don't know we

2177
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:37,000
exist or have a very they know maybe one

2178
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:39,010
research group exists but they

2179
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,010
don't see how it fits you know with this

2180
01:46:39,010 --> 01:46:44,350
whole ecosystem of you know internet

2181
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:51,250
research and they were the travel and

2182
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:52,930
the participation aspects well it's well

2183
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:55,660
I'll go back actually because the first

2184
01:46:52,930 --> 01:46:57,700
thing that I think was very easy to to

2185
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:59,349
resolve on the I've been on the call was

2186
01:46:57,700 --> 01:47:01,000
was the travel because you know more and

2187
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:03,580
more there's people who are

2188
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,560
participating remotely to this and if

2189
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:07,870
it's not for the thirteen hours ahead or

2190
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:09,270
the sixteen hours ahead or waking up at

2191
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:12,250
2:00 in the morning to attend a meeting

2192
01:47:09,270 --> 01:47:13,090
you can participate remotely and that

2193
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:15,760
won't cost you anything

2194
01:47:13,090 --> 01:47:21,070
so that was for me was mode the other

2195
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:24,400
ones were much more important so writing

2196
01:47:21,070 --> 01:47:26,200
a draft is not necessary to participate

2197
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,490
in the orgy meeting you know we don't

2198
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:31,269
put like if you don't have a draft here

2199
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:34,059
on command it's not the case we've had a

2200
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:36,940
number of academic presentations and I

2201
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:41,140
know a you know a lot of other research

2202
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:44,169
who have had that I think the networking

2203
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:46,510
prices and the workshops are exactly the

2204
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:49,090
right type of example of research that

2205
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:51,660
was done somewhere else that is actually

2206
01:47:49,090 --> 01:47:55,870
now great brought to this community and

2207
01:47:51,660 --> 01:47:57,880
we really welcome graduate and postdoc

2208
01:47:55,870 --> 01:48:00,460
and again I mentioned in our

2209
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:02,740
presentation that we participate in the

2210
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:05,110
hackathon and I will be honest with you

2211
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:08,080
when we participated in the hackathon in

2212
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:11,410
Montreal was actually to to have a lot

2213
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:14,860
of the local grad students being able to

2214
01:48:11,410 --> 01:48:16,480
come and see how it was going as a whole

2215
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:18,250
because in the hackathon you have all

2216
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:20,769
the groups are there and it was actually

2217
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:24,940
to enhance this participation from the

2218
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:28,420
local universities and another thing is

2219
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:33,299
again I mentioned this draft perception

2220
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:33,300
kind of uneven but if you think about it

2221
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:41,440
mindsets are hard to change and some

2222
01:48:39,070 --> 01:48:44,320
suggestions were that maybe we should

2223
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:47,200
state better the research challenges I

2224
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:49,750
think a lot of times on our wikis on the

2225
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:50,950
github and even on the Charter were very

2226
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:52,930
very focused

2227
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:55,269
something we would like the group to

2228
01:48:52,930 --> 01:48:58,300
achieve but maybe not how it fits in the

2229
01:48:55,270 --> 01:49:02,520
graters world of the research challenges

2230
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:07,270
for this field we could invite

2231
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:09,520
participation of people actually I thank

2232
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:11,650
Dave last time in Montreal he had

2233
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:14,620
suggested a researcher in Chicago who

2234
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:18,599
had a fantastic presentation and was

2235
01:49:14,620 --> 01:49:18,599
essentially had been invited for this

2236
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:23,769
co-locate actually people mentioned this

2237
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:26,200
and co-locate enter a meetings or even

2238
01:49:23,770 --> 01:49:28,420
meetings during a conference that are

2239
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:31,900
related to the field and organize

2240
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:35,350
workshop and there's actually a great

2241
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:37,389
presentation from Lori's on bridging the

2242
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:38,650
gap between internet standardization and

2243
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:45,550
networking that he presented in the

2244
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:49,450
Brazil other ideas maybe create and then

2245
01:49:45,550 --> 01:49:53,110
share specific use cases and data on the

2246
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:56,019
wiki and and basically create leverage

2247
01:49:53,110 --> 01:49:57,849
not just for one research group it may

2248
01:49:56,020 --> 01:50:00,270
be linked to what other research group

2249
01:49:57,850 --> 01:50:03,390
are also doing so that people can start

2250
01:50:00,270 --> 01:50:07,330
navigating through it

2251
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:09,910
add some research group topics in

2252
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:13,480
academic seminars and presentation I

2253
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:16,480
will try that we're doing ICN 2020 in

2254
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:18,459
Montreal and we want to add some

2255
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:20,139
presentations some seminars and

2256
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:21,490
workshops that go across a number of

2257
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:24,190
things and see how we can actually

2258
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:26,230
disseminate not just one research group

2259
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:28,330
ICN but maybe also the one the other one

2260
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:35,950
I'm involved with coin and that we're

2261
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:37,809
coding and maybe we always say you can

2262
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:39,639
actually take your research and bring it

2263
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:43,080
into a draft or why don't do the other

2264
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:48,190
way around also take some of the draft

2265
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:50,470
examples or the draft presentations or

2266
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:54,900
the draft writings and bring them into a

2267
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:54,900
paper and Aaron has a question

2268
01:50:55,710 --> 01:51:00,130
Aaron Falk I lots of good stuff here we

2269
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:04,679
chose a nice to meet you outside

2270
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:08,849
Canberra J 5,000 meals away one

2271
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:11,949
idea that I've seen that is not on here

2272
01:51:08,849 --> 01:51:14,049
is something the NMR G implemented which

2273
01:51:11,949 --> 01:51:16,688
is that they did pre-publication reviews

2274
01:51:14,049 --> 01:51:18,279
of papers and I think they needed some

2275
01:51:16,689 --> 01:51:22,229
confidentiality to be able to do that

2276
01:51:18,279 --> 01:51:24,489
but there was a my understanding is that

2277
01:51:22,229 --> 01:51:28,919
folks perceived that as being a real

2278
01:51:24,489 --> 01:51:32,228
benefit the papers approved good idea

2279
01:51:28,919 --> 01:51:34,179
are you finished or no there's three

2280
01:51:32,229 --> 01:51:36,219
more slides and maybe my question will

2281
01:51:34,179 --> 01:51:37,749
be your question the answered but you

2282
01:51:36,219 --> 01:51:40,779
know please ask you a question if it's

2283
01:51:37,749 --> 01:51:44,969
further I'm going to say yes well I

2284
01:51:40,779 --> 01:51:44,969
don't want to prevent you finishing so

2285
01:51:45,029 --> 01:51:49,359
quickly antidote right I actually was

2286
01:51:47,379 --> 01:51:51,189
told recently in a year that I had zero

2287
01:51:49,359 --> 01:51:52,299
academic papers and a couple of rfcs

2288
01:51:51,189 --> 01:51:55,719
that you know that wasn't good enough

2289
01:51:52,299 --> 01:51:57,459
and so I get that that particular issue

2290
01:51:55,719 --> 01:51:59,169
and then this year actually have two

2291
01:51:57,459 --> 01:52:02,259
really good academic papers and zero

2292
01:51:59,169 --> 01:52:04,089
RFC's because the RFC's are taking that

2293
01:52:02,259 --> 01:52:05,709
much longer and that much harder to get

2294
01:52:04,089 --> 01:52:07,119
through the system and i'm now going on

2295
01:52:05,709 --> 01:52:09,489
like working group last call number

2296
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:12,009
three because people really care and so

2297
01:52:09,489 --> 01:52:13,539
right you're absolutely right i think

2298
01:52:12,009 --> 01:52:15,219
one of the fundamental problems though

2299
01:52:13,539 --> 01:52:19,358
is no matter how much of these other

2300
01:52:15,219 --> 01:52:21,879
things you do the IETF and the IRT F are

2301
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:24,609
not listed on the academic you know

2302
01:52:21,879 --> 01:52:27,249
grading scale of conferences from A to F

2303
01:52:24,609 --> 01:52:29,799
and I think it's only I think it's

2304
01:52:27,249 --> 01:52:31,449
uneven I think in in some circles it is

2305
01:52:29,799 --> 01:52:33,459
well known and though there's it's not I

2306
01:52:31,449 --> 01:52:35,619
mean it's I think it's our it's our goal

2307
01:52:33,459 --> 01:52:37,929
to make it maybe gap bridge that gap

2308
01:52:35,619 --> 01:52:40,598
yeah I wanted actually other comment

2309
01:52:37,929 --> 01:52:42,669
because in my case my supervisors

2310
01:52:40,599 --> 01:52:44,619
absolutely know what the IETF is since

2311
01:52:42,669 --> 01:52:46,239
is I actually helped create it so you

2312
01:52:44,619 --> 01:52:48,398
know the knowledge of not understanding

2313
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:50,049
it isn't a problem it's just from the

2314
01:52:48,399 --> 01:52:53,739
academic you know grading perspective

2315
01:52:50,049 --> 01:52:56,109
yes I think it's interesting the way

2316
01:52:53,739 --> 01:52:58,449
different countries evaluate the

2317
01:52:56,109 --> 01:53:00,579
research you know in some places

2318
01:52:58,449 --> 01:53:03,909
research impact is very heavily assessed

2319
01:53:00,579 --> 01:53:05,709
and you know the the ITF IRT effective

2320
01:53:03,909 --> 01:53:10,478
it sees can throw a lot more than in

2321
01:53:05,709 --> 01:53:13,839
other regions I also make you know I'm

2322
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:16,130
inspired by your bullet about vision or

2323
01:53:13,839 --> 01:53:18,730
blue sky papers

2324
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:21,730
and it struck me from some of my past

2325
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:25,400
time like an anti stuff that fields have

2326
01:53:21,730 --> 01:53:28,280
like 10 year horizon planning that they

2327
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:30,620
do a little bit formally but that is

2328
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:33,290
very valuable for those fields in terms

2329
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:35,510
of getting funding and maybe that's

2330
01:53:33,290 --> 01:53:38,630
another way you could do this is is have

2331
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:42,070
kind of informal review here and RG is

2332
01:53:38,630 --> 01:53:44,510
free but lending itself to that kind of

2333
01:53:42,070 --> 01:53:46,849
consensus about what big open directions

2334
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:49,850
are that could be helpful for the

2335
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:55,040
community academic community okay thank

2336
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:57,200
you Dan McDonough which so I'm looking

2337
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:59,900
at this second you know idea invite

2338
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:03,349
participation in research groups and IDs

2339
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:07,280
from leading academics let's have a

2340
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:09,140
regular ITF participant contributor how

2341
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:11,240
can they know who are the leading you

2342
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:13,850
know participants usually how we know

2343
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:15,950
people come and volunteer this we find

2344
01:54:13,850 --> 01:54:17,560
out who is interested in the area that

2345
01:54:15,950 --> 01:54:22,130
you know this we are doing some work

2346
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:24,500
yeah I think I think okay the next

2347
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:26,870
problem well I think I'll sound like a

2348
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:29,120
social media guru here or some kind of

2349
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:31,700
influencer but we all are at the center

2350
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:33,230
of especially in this research world

2351
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:35,990
we're all at the center of a large

2352
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:37,700
number of connections and we know who

2353
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:39,800
are the leaders in or grew in a world

2354
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:41,660
and we can actually reach out to them

2355
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:43,340
and if they cannot come because you know

2356
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:44,780
for reason they can a lot of times

2357
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:47,570
people are really nice and they're going

2358
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:49,759
to suggest somebody else so I think we

2359
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:51,349
should we should not think that the

2360
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:53,570
world is limited to this room you know

2361
01:54:51,350 --> 01:54:56,030
the world is is they're all around and

2362
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:58,849
connected in a hundred ways so I

2363
01:54:56,030 --> 01:55:01,160
actually strongly believe that you know

2364
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:03,880
if we invite ya you know every time I've

2365
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:06,920
invited somebody in this environment

2366
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:12,530
even when they couldn't come they

2367
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:13,880
actually suggested someone else you

2368
01:55:12,530 --> 01:55:16,400
wrote that line at the bigger at the

2369
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:18,830
bottom if so about the vision and blue

2370
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:22,030
sky paper yes yes yours it's because I

2371
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:24,440
keep seeing that conferences

2372
01:55:22,030 --> 01:55:26,000
increasingly are including vision and

2373
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:28,480
blue sky papers and they are often

2374
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:30,700
invited papers so

2375
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:32,919
you know it's in some ways like a free

2376
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:35,830
pass into a conference and it's super

2377
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:38,920
fun but I wanted to go back to the point

2378
01:55:35,830 --> 01:55:40,660
about how do we get the academic

2379
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:45,160
community to change their perception

2380
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:46,720
that the RFC's aren't as are more

2381
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:49,150
important you know at least we want

2382
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:51,570
equal grounding right or we want people

2383
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:54,519
to be rewarded for it and I wondered

2384
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:57,130
whether in the same way that vision and

2385
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:59,080
blue sky papers are around fostering

2386
01:55:57,130 --> 01:56:01,810
looking further ahead and that's what

2387
01:55:59,080 --> 01:56:04,660
the IRT F does whether we can reach out

2388
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:08,470
to some of the communities like and I'm

2389
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:10,750
from the US so this is a us-centric idea

2390
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:13,720
but it translates to other gos

2391
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:16,540
if we go to places we have organizations

2392
01:56:13,720 --> 01:56:19,060
like the NSF and like DARPA and you know

2393
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:21,730
the Army has some you know they're

2394
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:23,070
they're structures in place about what

2395
01:56:21,730 --> 01:56:25,269
are the organizations particularly

2396
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:29,019
government-funded that are looking at

2397
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:31,270
the challenges of connectivity and so

2398
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:33,190
forth and having a seat at that table

2399
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:36,460
and that's where the academics see that

2400
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:39,219
we've a seat at the table and so and I

2401
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:43,180
think yeah I think there is an example

2402
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:45,940
of how this it works

2403
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:48,460
I'm old enough to have come to the IETF

2404
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:51,099
where it was really only us people and

2405
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:54,070
I'm also reviewer on the European

2406
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:56,080
research projects the well that was

2407
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:58,059
called age 2020 but it was called all

2408
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:59,559
kinds of other things before and I one

2409
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:01,120
point somebody put in some of the

2410
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:04,510
outcomes and dissemination was

2411
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:07,300
participation in the Internet IETF and

2412
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:11,290
suddenly the rise of Europeans in the in

2413
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:13,210
the IETF went that way and I think maybe

2414
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:14,860
there's some similar thing that we could

2415
01:57:13,210 --> 01:57:17,650
do in the IRT F to get more

2416
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:20,740
participation and my point was that we

2417
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:23,230
can certainly go out and ask others to

2418
01:57:20,740 --> 01:57:26,139
come into our community how do we go out

2419
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:28,059
and get him but I think it I think it's

2420
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:32,430
a two-way thing right so that was more

2421
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:32,430
the nature of my yeah point and question

2422
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:40,520
Christian Itamar about the OFC and

2423
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:44,360
evaluation

2424
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:46,640
the arts editor pushed a change in the

2425
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:48,799
artsy format couple of years ago Donna

2426
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:52,190
was a you noticed to have an OID

2427
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:55,700
reference on every RFC which was

2428
01:57:52,190 --> 01:58:00,169
precisely to facilitate citations of

2429
01:57:55,700 --> 01:58:04,160
RFC's in journals and you can actually

2430
01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:08,960
very easily count the citations of a

2431
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:12,019
given RFC on values libraries and I

2432
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:15,410
think that if we are concerned with that

2433
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:19,010
and you can use these citations as a way

2434
01:58:15,410 --> 01:58:25,940
to give weight to publications yeah

2435
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:29,840
Thank You Marco an additional note

2436
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:33,860
related to this there is a very good

2437
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:38,810
paper published in ACM CCR by prying

2438
01:58:33,860 --> 01:58:41,120
carpenter and great portraits that

2439
01:58:38,810 --> 01:58:43,430
discusses the role of the RSC's as a

2440
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:48,019
scorer paper starting from how to cite

2441
01:58:43,430 --> 01:58:52,880
them thank you okay um so I'm getting

2442
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:56,180
out of Ohio I'm sorry this quickly

2443
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:58,760
um I'm thinking that this presentation

2444
01:58:56,180 --> 01:59:00,400
and also the discussion is suffering a

2445
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:05,090
little bit from what we actually

2446
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:07,099
criticized earlier so projecting so

2447
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:10,640
known methods of working from the IETF

2448
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:12,620
to I RTF research and then wondering oh

2449
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:14,900
why doesn't this work for academics so I

2450
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:16,610
think you even mentioned standardization

2451
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:18,620
on an earlier slide I mean this isn't

2452
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:22,990
really not what this is about

2453
01:59:18,620 --> 01:59:26,240
and so RFC's I mean that's an issue that

2454
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:28,340
so we know that in a standard strike

2455
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:33,380
obviously takes some time but that's not

2456
01:59:28,340 --> 01:59:35,570
what we are doing in the NDF and so I

2457
01:59:33,380 --> 01:59:38,780
think what Dave mentioned earlier that's

2458
01:59:35,570 --> 01:59:43,250
really important that so there are at

2459
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:45,469
least two criteria to be aware of so say

2460
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:48,650
some useful output for the IDF and in

2461
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:52,490
some way but also when doing really good

2462
01:59:48,650 --> 01:59:54,019
relevant quality research and if you if

2463
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:55,730
we are not able to do that

2464
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:58,969
and no academic will find it interesting

2465
01:59:55,730 --> 02:00:02,709
yeah I know to come to us so and and for

2466
01:59:58,969 --> 02:00:06,140
that I think it could be interesting to

2467
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:09,290
discuss a certain indicators or say

2468
02:00:06,140 --> 02:00:11,510
models that seem to work well and also

2469
02:00:09,290 --> 02:00:16,519
maybe ask the question I mean what's the

2470
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:18,890
point of writing a draft or our see I

2471
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:22,630
mean there must be some you know some

2472
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:27,040
utility to that and so what I think is

2473
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:31,190
useful is see this as a means to enable

2474
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:33,739
experimentation so to be able to you

2475
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:36,259
know take the you know academic research

2476
02:00:33,739 --> 02:00:38,480
I would how are things and you know keep

2477
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:40,580
people honest and make things comparable

2478
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:43,580
and then try to gain some insights or

2479
02:00:40,580 --> 02:00:46,790
that and this is where our model is

2480
02:00:43,580 --> 02:00:51,739
useful so writing up specs in a sense

2481
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:54,230
and looking at that and so I would kind

2482
02:00:51,739 --> 02:00:57,799
of maybe turn us around and ask what are

2483
02:00:54,230 --> 02:01:03,019
good indicators and say good models that

2484
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:05,000
have worked well thank you Jana anger

2485
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:11,390
I'll be quick

2486
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:12,890
I agree that drafts have a use but you

2487
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:14,180
point out that priority of draft

2488
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:16,790
perception in the academic world is

2489
02:01:14,180 --> 02:01:19,610
uneven at best I would argue that a new

2490
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:22,700
draft perception in all worlds is uneven

2491
02:01:19,610 --> 02:01:25,639
at best just to not a belabor the point

2492
02:01:22,700 --> 02:01:27,440
but even ITF drafts are all over the

2493
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:30,380
place you can have an independent

2494
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:32,480
submission you can have an informational

2495
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:34,100
RFC you can have RFC's that have had

2496
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:36,309
review that I haven't have as much

2497
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:39,410
review as we believe and the IDF is

2498
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:42,380
completely you know it's it's much more

2499
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:43,969
there's much more variance in IRT after

2500
02:01:42,380 --> 02:01:46,219
have certain errors in the IDF class and

2501
02:01:43,969 --> 02:01:48,050
in that sense as an academic who has

2502
02:01:46,219 --> 02:01:52,280
tried to who's who's gotten tenure based

2503
02:01:48,050 --> 02:01:54,739
on on publications I couldn't rely on on

2504
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:57,259
RFC's and that's just a fact of life

2505
02:01:54,739 --> 02:02:00,349
it's it's not I don't think it's

2506
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:02,750
reasonable to expect academics to to do

2507
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:05,180
for us to change the perception because

2508
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:06,650
it's not a perception issue it is it's a

2509
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:08,570
real issue in the sense that the the

2510
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:10,580
goals of

2511
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:12,980
what we do here tend to be different

2512
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:15,290
than the goals of what academic

2513
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:19,459
publications tend to be and my question

2514
02:02:15,290 --> 02:02:21,650
to you is why why is that the case

2515
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:23,870
because we want to foster good research

2516
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:27,460
if you look at the papers that are

2517
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:29,809
always presented out of the the

2518
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:34,930
networking prizes and everything it's

2519
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:37,490
always top-notch stuff so it makes no

2520
02:02:34,930 --> 02:02:40,490
you know we're not doing second-rate

2521
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:43,190
stuff here and I think that's that's

2522
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:44,780
actually part of the perception so maybe

2523
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:46,519
so the second point I was gonna make

2524
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:50,840
might speak to what you just what are

2525
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:52,250
you just asking i I want to I I won't

2526
02:02:50,840 --> 02:02:53,990
disagree with the fact that we do

2527
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:55,910
research in the research groups I'll

2528
02:02:53,990 --> 02:03:00,290
disagree with this personally I think we

2529
02:02:55,910 --> 02:03:01,550
foster research well yes I think it's a

2530
02:03:00,290 --> 02:03:04,610
very important distinction and the

2531
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:06,650
distinction here is participants do

2532
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:08,509
research so I'll give you an example

2533
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:10,129
right nicey crg I think we foster

2534
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:12,440
research what that means is there are

2535
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:14,390
groups that go off do research publish

2536
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:17,179
come here and present what they've done

2537
02:03:14,390 --> 02:03:19,100
and they'll keep coming back and doing

2538
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:21,530
stuff they don't use us as a publication

2539
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:24,740
venue we as a research group aren't

2540
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:27,139
publishing one thing but we are engaging

2541
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:29,840
with various entities various groups

2542
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:31,670
students industry groups that are

2543
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:32,960
publishing on their own but we are

2544
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:35,750
creating an environment where they all

2545
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:37,580
come talk and we have a forum for that

2546
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:40,010
to happen so as a research group I think

2547
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:42,140
we foster research I don't think we are

2548
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:44,180
a publication venue but I think we

2549
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:47,320
should be clear about the fact that we

2550
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:50,510
are allowing and encouraging and and

2551
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:55,009
making the research happen but the

2552
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:58,610
metrics shouldn't be publication hi

2553
02:03:55,010 --> 02:04:00,530
David I want to go beyond and and

2554
02:03:58,610 --> 02:04:03,230
emphasize I think even more strongly

2555
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:06,349
what Jana was was getting at I mean I do

2556
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:09,049
research I run in an orgy I participate

2557
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:11,060
in RG if I have some super great idea

2558
02:04:09,050 --> 02:04:12,290
I'm not going to take it to an orgy I'm

2559
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:14,660
going to write a paper and I'm going to

2560
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:17,180
get it through a double-blind program

2561
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:20,269
committee and convince people that this

2562
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:22,359
is this is super novel and something is

2563
02:04:20,270 --> 02:04:25,339
going to change the world

2564
02:04:22,359 --> 02:04:27,229
what are G's are I think going to be

2565
02:04:25,339 --> 02:04:30,409
most successful doing is this

2566
02:04:27,229 --> 02:04:33,769
collaboration function right which is

2567
02:04:30,409 --> 02:04:35,419
because academics I got to tell you they

2568
02:04:33,769 --> 02:04:35,749
don't collaborate very well with each

2569
02:04:35,419 --> 02:04:37,429
other

2570
02:04:35,749 --> 02:04:39,079
they're forced they're forced to by

2571
02:04:37,429 --> 02:04:41,859
their funding agencies and if they

2572
02:04:39,079 --> 02:04:46,129
weren't forced to they wouldn't do it

2573
02:04:41,859 --> 02:04:48,229
they you know so I Eve's here and she

2574
02:04:46,129 --> 02:04:52,579
she may want to comment on this we have

2575
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:55,219
a really good joint project between NSF

2576
02:04:52,579 --> 02:04:58,009
and Intel that talks about Wireless edge

2577
02:04:55,219 --> 02:05:02,209
computing and ICN we have been I think

2578
02:04:58,010 --> 02:05:03,889
we have a absolutely perfect zero record

2579
02:05:02,209 --> 02:05:06,409
of getting anybody who was doing

2580
02:05:03,889 --> 02:05:09,709
research under that project to come and

2581
02:05:06,409 --> 02:05:12,318
present it at at either IC NRG or any of

2582
02:05:09,709 --> 02:05:15,530
the wireless oriented research groups

2583
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:19,879
and the reason for that is that it's

2584
02:05:15,530 --> 02:05:23,568
it's an extra it's extra work for no

2585
02:05:19,879 --> 02:05:26,659
particular benefit in those contexts so

2586
02:05:23,569 --> 02:05:30,229
for me I think we have to push this this

2587
02:05:26,659 --> 02:05:34,608
collaboration and community aspect of

2588
02:05:30,229 --> 02:05:36,679
the function of the IRT F and and make

2589
02:05:34,609 --> 02:05:39,409
our case based on that as opposed to

2590
02:05:36,679 --> 02:05:42,530
we're doing great research in the IRT F

2591
02:05:39,409 --> 02:05:44,058
Thanks yeah and and I think yeah I was

2592
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:45,858
always thinking was that with it's not

2593
02:05:44,059 --> 02:05:48,229
that we do good research I think our

2594
02:05:45,859 --> 02:05:52,969
partners good research so I'm thank you

2595
02:05:48,229 --> 02:05:56,119
for for correcting this yes yeah that's

2596
02:05:52,969 --> 02:05:58,760
a time I'm afraid ease oh okay okay so I

2597
02:05:56,119 --> 02:06:00,829
switched a few things I skipped a few

2598
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:02,719
things so I can I can see that obviously

2599
02:06:00,829 --> 02:06:04,759
we can do better I really like the idea

2600
02:06:02,719 --> 02:06:06,439
the fostering I really like the idea of

2601
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:08,989
the community the communities and

2602
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:10,639
actually I'm going to conclude with

2603
02:06:08,989 --> 02:06:13,489
something that I said this morning my

2604
02:06:10,639 --> 02:06:14,539
first presentation at 7:30 what we want

2605
02:06:13,489 --> 02:06:16,968
to create in this Agora

2606
02:06:14,539 --> 02:06:19,489
for people to come and share and you

2607
02:06:16,969 --> 02:06:21,379
know essentially have the rest of the

2608
02:06:19,489 --> 02:06:22,818
community understand what they're doing

2609
02:06:21,379 --> 02:06:25,519
why they're doing it and how we can

2610
02:06:22,819 --> 02:06:27,019
create even more research thank you all

2611

2615
02:06:33,469 --> 02:06:37,340

02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:38,599
