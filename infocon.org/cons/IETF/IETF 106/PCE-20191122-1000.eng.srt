decisions are taken on mailing list when

64
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,100

the discussion was and why you have done

72
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,940
the update what does this update look

73
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,280
like the onus is on you to keep the

74
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,710
working group in loop so this is our

75
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,380
requesters chairs that please use

76
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,770
mailing list a little bit more it's the

77
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,419
most

78
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,799
important tool that we have for our

79
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,930
records as well as for

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,909
consensus-building also a request that

81
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,680
when our documents goes to working group

82
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:34,259
at option call as well as working group

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,470
last call we would request you to send

84
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:41,400
more responses we have a difficult time

85
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:45,300
to interpret what does the silence in

86
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,539
the list means does it mean no support

87
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,520
does it mean don't care you could just

88
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,590
say that that that's a valid response

89
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,280
that's an input for us to change while

90
00:05:52,590 --> 00:06:00,030
we are looking at the consensus it's

91
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:02,340
also important that this put in a record

92
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,530
not just for the working group but isg

93
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,869
as well as other Directorate look at the

94
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,840
mailing list to gosh how much the

95
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,400
document is a output of the working

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,409
group as a whole rather than a pet

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,830
project of a few authors so it's

98
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:19,860
important that we get this information

99
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,500
on the list so please be more vocal on

100
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,490
the list and review each other's ideas

101
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,190
and not just work on your own pet

102
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,440
projects but in all our outputs of the

103
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:33,210
working group is a combined output every

104
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,219
working group adopted document is an

105
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,258
output of the working group so we have

106
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:39,449
to collectively take responsibility for

107
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,150
those documents so please review

108
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,770
documents from each other and let's

109
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,979
progress the work that we have been

110
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,849
doing in the working group okay how many

111
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:54,360
of you are aware that we have a wiki

112
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:56,150
okay that's a pretty good number and we

113
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,229
have been doing this for last couple of

114
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,210
IDF's we have been maintaining our

115
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,699
adoption queue our progress of the

116
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,400
documents how we are balancing the work

117
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,099
if there is an action needed from either

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,210
the authors or the chairs that's been

119
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:14,250
identified so please continue to use the

120
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,130
wiki if you have an update you can

121
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,960
update it yourself or you can send a

122
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,990
note to me or hurry

123
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,380
our Julien and we can keep it up to date

124
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,419
it with the latest status of your

125
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:29,639
documents if you have any suggestion on

126
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:32,639
what else can be captured on a wiki or

127
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,740
if you have a preference of

128
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,460
for instance some working groups prefer

129
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,139
to send weekly status versus a wiki so

130
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,210
if you have any suggestion of how this

131
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,310
information can be more useful for the

132
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,810
working group please give us feedback a

133
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,819
reminder that in this working group we

134
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,280
have an implementation policy the

135
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,050
implementation policy states that every

136
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,059
working group ID should have an

137
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,789
inflammation implementation status

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,280
section which should talk about whether

139
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:04,889
an existing implement exists or are you

140
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,929
planning to implement it or there are no

141
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,090
implementation as of now some

142
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,970
information needs to be captured in this

143
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,880
section we will do the working group

144
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,220
last call only when this section has has

145
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,800
been added to your document most of the

146
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,199
documents have done so there are still a

147
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,229
few so if your documents is one of those

148
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,180
please add this section and if you have

149
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:32,179
a valid reason not to add this section

150
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:37,110
please get a approval from the chairs

151
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:40,218

152
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,709
documents on segment routing on PCC sees

153

PCC see some new ideas and some old

154
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:49,170
ideas that have been discussed before we

155
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,360
did a little bit of shuffling since the

156
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:54,569
last time we sent the agenda out that

157
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,060
was to manage a clash between the RTG WG

158
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:02,370
presentations as well

159
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:05,849
any comments on the agenda one two three

160
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:09,630
go okay now we are at the working group

161
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,600
status section of the presentation we

162
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,360
have no new RFC since our last IETF

163
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,660
meeting but nothing to worry there is a

164
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,120
long queue of documents in the RFC

165
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,380
editor queue and thank you for the

166
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,170
working group for everyone who

167
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,540
contributed to these documents and we

168
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,430
have made one quite a bit of progress

169
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,120
and cleared some of our backlog

170
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,560
specially in the ITF last few things so

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,630
thanks to the working group thanks to

172
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,969
IAD thanks to all our Sheppard's

173
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:42,660
directorates everybody who helped out in

174
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,839
this so a quick run through segment

175
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,469
routing which is a part of cluster c3

176
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,740
force you

177
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:55,140
which is all the mpls segments routing

178
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:58,350
document across spring MPLS OLS are etc

179
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,990
right now this is odd 48 done that means

180
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,810
that the final version from RFC editor

181
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,850
is out and authors had a look and they

182
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,280
have confirmed that this version is

183
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,440
ready to go and the whole cluster will

184
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,500
be published together that's where this

185
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,960
this document is waiting we have a miss

186
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,330
roof on w.zahn which is waiting for

187
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,820
gmpls with status I will cover in the

188
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,360
next slide one document which is

189
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:28,110
currently in odd 48 which is a hockey

190
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,760
extension most of the work here is done

191
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,470
there are only a few comments that we

192
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,380
need to talk to the RFC editor and

193
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,870
resolve this and then this document will

194
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,360
be ready to be published as well couple

195
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,610
of documents which RFC editor is editing

196
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,670
which is Association group and inter

197
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:48,360
area ace applicability and some

198
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:52,469
documents which are in the queue to be

199
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:56,490
processed there are two documents which

200
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,730
are still with the eye as she the gmpls

201
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,950
had discussed for a long time but Cyril

202
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,740
had made an update and discussed with

203
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,900
the ad and the discuss is cleared we

204
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,620
still have last two pending comments

205
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,500
that needs to be answered and once those

206
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,370
are done finally we would get this

207
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,100
document out to the RFC editor as well

208
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,860
the diversity document was under-eyes

209
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,640
she tell each art just before this IETF

210
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,310
it has a discus and it's pending authors

211
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,350
to response so authors have told me that

212
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,579
they will try to respond this just after

213
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:38,190
this ITF we had some early code point

214
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,830
allocation request but those documents

215
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,839
have now reached RFC editor queue so we

216
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,690
don't have to worry about them anymore

217
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,150
and right after this we will have no

218
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,390
other early code point pending in our

219
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:52,860
eye on a registry we got one Arata

220
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,870
during this period

221
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,060
Arata is 5 7 9 6 on our of c 8 2 3 1

222
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,790
this was regarding the error handling

223
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,030
Arif ocation the chairs suggested that

224
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,750
we should put this rod on a hold for an

225
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:12,000
actual document update for now and we

226
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:16,410
will discuss with the ad to progress

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,050
this after this idea of meeting we have

228
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,540
an incoming liaison this you would have

229
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:26,520
seen in other working groups as well

230
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:30,300
this liaison came from itu-t and came to

231
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:32,880
see cam MPLS pals BC and T's Scotsmen

232
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,209
field is the responsible liaison manager

233
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,630
here and the chairs are collecting the

234
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:42,840
list of documents that we need to add in

235
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,090
our reply for this this message if

236
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,250
anybody has any comments on this please

237
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:52,710
reach out to the chairs so this covers

238
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:55,500
the working group status the last

239
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,510
section of the chair slide is about the

240
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,590
status of all the working group IDs and

241
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:04,500
the next steps so we have two documents

242
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:07,290
which are in the post working group last

243
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,590
call state the first is the PC stateful

244
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,900
Flags which was earlier a draft ferrell

245
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:16,590
pc stateful Flags when we did the last

246
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:18,750
call and sent to the is G B got the

247
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,750
request back to the working group to

248
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:25,470
change the name which was done and a

249
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:27,300
request to get any other feedback from

250
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,460
the working group was also given so the

251
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:33,089
last date is actually today so if you

252
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:35,580
have not seen this or if you have a

253
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,340
support for publication this as our

254
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,410
request for being more vocal on the list

255
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,080
this would be a good example to just do

256
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:46,560
this right away it's a very simple small

257
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,870
document that you can go through it it

258
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,670
clarifies something that was missed in

259
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,680
RFC eight two three ones which fixes a

260
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:57,150
mistake that the working group made so

261
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,099
before we ship it to the to the ad as a

262
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,310
second try today's the last day for you

263
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:04,650
to respond as a working group we have

264
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,500
another document the piece F flowspec

265
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,930
whose working group last call was

266
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,050
extended because we had a late IPR and

267
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,040
this is something again a reminder for

268
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,949
everyone

269
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,160
- to make sure that the IPR declaration

270
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,380
is done at the right time it's your

271
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,959
responsibility as a working group to

272
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:30,060
make sure that you do this timely and

273
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,670
also we have the Shepherd review for

274
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,979
this document ready and soon we will be

275
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:40,610
able to publish and send this to ad as

276
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:43,680
well some documents that we believe are

277
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,410
nearing working of last call we have the

278
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,130
LSP scheduling - association drafts

279
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,569
policy and bi-directional so this is

280
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,890
just a heads-up to the working group

281
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,570
that these are the documents that we

282
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,660
will be doing last call so if you have

283
00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:00,960
not read this or if you this is the time

284
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,870
to familiarize yourself before we do the

285
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,690
last call we have one document which is

286
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,930
stateful gmpls

287
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:13,350
this is now my this is a we merged the

288
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,900
remote initiated gmpls LSP into this

289
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,390
document as well after that there was an

290
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,660
editorial update done there are still a

291
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:24,240
few small reorganization in the document

292
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,660
that would help with the readability so

293
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,750
once that's done we can I think the

294
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,540
content is pretty stable we can move to

295
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,630
the working group last call as well the

296
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,630
last document there is a piece F yang it

297
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:41,700
imports bunch of key documents the good

298
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,620
thing is the T documents are now

299
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:47,730
progressing quite well in the t's

300
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,280
working group and other places but if

301
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:53,610
there is one document which is the net

302
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,350
conf DLS client server and Tom patch on

303
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,540
the mailing list as well pointed this

304
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,930
out that this might take a little long

305
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,969
longer from the net-net conf working

306
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:04,620
group to progress it's in a big queue

307
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,250
they have a bunch of other documents

308
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,650
related to the crypto that they want to

309
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,500
focus on first before they come to the

310
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,939
TLS client server so it's a question for

311
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,820
the working group that should be wait

312
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,940
should we send ours and put a note to

313
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,560
the RFC editor that the tree and some

314
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,930
parts of the document would need to be

315
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,719
updated once the TLS client server

316
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,449
reaches the reaches

317
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,639
the RFC id2q so this is something that

318
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:35,550
we need to think i with the chairs and

319
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,800
the ad will discuss this and we'll come

320
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,019
back to the working group with what's

321
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,490
the right way to move forward if anybody

322
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:45,889
has any suggestion this would be a

323
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,889
perfect time to talk about it as well

324
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:53,670
okay we have some other documents we

325
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,310
have a native IP document which was

326
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:59,399
presented at 104 there has been a change

327
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,949
a route priority got added in one of the

328
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,169
explicit peer route TLV and most of the

329
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:07,980
other changes were editorial so please

330
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:10,620
review these changes another document

331
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,870
was enhanced error again discussed in

332
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:16,139
104 there has been an update the main

333
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:18,178
update was we agreed on a guideline that

334
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,669
that should be followed for any future

335
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,490
document that adds error and not affect

336
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:25,829
and notification and what X they need to

337
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:29,640
add to make sure that the enhanced

338
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:32,549
errors are also supported so that text

339
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,260
is now in the in the 0-6 version and

340
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:39,780
most of the other changes were editorial

341
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:43,700
some recent working groups document we

342
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:47,879
have a flex great document and the SR v6

343
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,580
document mostly clean up a little bit of

344
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,669
syncing of changes between the MPLS SR

345
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:57,389
and SR v6 but the documents are

346
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:59,610
progressing quite well these are the

347
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,640
documents that we adopted since the last

348
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,399
meeting we have the binding said VN

349
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,950
Association and the path segments the

350
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,340
first two documents also have a zero one

351
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,260
version posted with the comments during

352
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,990
the working group adoption poll already

353
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,940
handled please if you have further

354
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,200
suggestions for these documents please

355
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,299
use the list and provide your feedback

356
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:28,559
the final slide from the working group

357
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:31,230
is adoption poll Q so this is our Q or

358
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,600
as you would see in our wiki of various

359
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,840
documents that the chairs feel should be

360
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,360
called for adoption you can go to the

361
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,409
wiki and also see another list which is

362
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,510
a list of the

363
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,070
humans that the authors feel they are

364
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,690
ready to be adopted and we are

365
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,730
maintaining it a little bit separately

366
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,070
so you know your requests are heard and

367
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,990
they are documented somewhere and the

368
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,360
chairs will have to make a decision on

369
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,630
them soon once we have some of our

370
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,179
pending documents out of the way

371
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:03,760
hi this is Mike Alicia from Cisco we

372
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,560
already implemented the PC segment

373
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,810
routing policy CP the fourth item so we

374
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,240
would really like early code point

375
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:16,389
allocation and so for that reason I

376
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,480
request to expedite the adoption of that

377
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,460
draft thanks Mike

378
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,120
noted I will discuss this with Julian

379
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,860
and come back to you thanks is anybody

380
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,520
has any other comment on their working

381
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:34,080
group document or any adoption question

382
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,080
otherwise we'll start with our agenda

383
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:54,210
okay thank you

384
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:56,680
first up is Mike hello this is Mike

385
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:00,250
coalition from Cisco I'm presenting on

386
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,710
behalf of my co-authors so this is e

387
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:08,680
step extensions for multipath

388
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:15,010
information so originally when p sub you

389
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:20,020
only had one er o her LSP and so there's

390
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:21,790
been a number of recent recent

391
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,600
applications where that's not sufficient

392
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:28,540
anymore and so I listed three that we

393
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,060
are facing right now so one is as we

394
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,350
know for s our policy

395
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:39,760
each candidate path can have a list of

396
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:41,740
segment lists and basically this is not

397
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:48,000
possible currently to represent and PISA

398
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:51,700
to have multiple segment lists second is

399
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,260
if you want to request a certain number

400
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,970
of band a certain amount of bandwidth

401
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,830
but

402
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:02,260
there is no one path that can satisfy

403
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:05,800
that bandwidth then this today there is

404
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:09,270
no way to return several paths that can

405
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:14,169
split the bandwidth among themselves in

406
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:20,950
some kind of multi path and the third

407
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:22,990
use case is we want to allow one path to

408
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:31,780
protect another path basically to

409
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:33,910
specify a kind of protection so we

410
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,550
choose to include these yellow objects

411
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,260
in the same piece of LSP rather than

412
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,350
creating multiple pieces at our speeds

413
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:44,050
and this was kind of discussed on the

414
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:49,750
mailing list as well and so this gives

415
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:52,500
the nice property that a single single

416
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:56,710
report update initiate and also

417
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:01,030
stateless reply message carries all the

418
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:03,370
information that you need you don't need

419
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:09,610
to aggregate multiple reply messages or

420
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:11,889
multiple you know update messages and so

421
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:15,840
it's very simple we just introduced this

422
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:19,420
ero attributes object and this object

423
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,179
simply acts as a separator between arrow

424
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:25,630
objects and it also carries some

425
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,330
attributes so basically wherever you

426
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:32,740
have the aro object you can replace it

427
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:34,780
with aro attributes followed by aro

428
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:40,270
followed by aro attributes followed by

429
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:44,649
arrow and so on and the subject carries

430
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:47,710
multiple TVs which can encode whatever

431
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:55,120
attributes you want to that ero to have

432
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:58,630
oh sorry just to go back so we define

433
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:02,649
like a weight TLV for carrying a weight

434
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:05,320
of each arrow which would allow for an

435
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:08,580
equal cost multi path which is required

436
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,580
for segment routing policy

437
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:18,970
we also define the steel V for allowing

438
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:23,139
protection between different paths so

439
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:27,000
just allows more rich response from the

440
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:31,120
BC and the capability for this is

441
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,350
signaled in the open object using this

442
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:39,459
Tod and so it specifies here the number

443
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:44,290
of multipaths that that you want to that

444
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:46,690
the requester is able to support so if

445
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:49,090
this tier we can go in two places either

446
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,910
in the open object or in the LSP object

447
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:55,659
so if it goes into the open object that

448
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:58,900
means that it's like a box wide though

449
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,440
default value versus if it goes in the

450
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,390
LSP object it allows you to override the

451
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,540
global box value so you can say that a

452
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:10,450
particular LSP I don't want any ecmp for

453
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,220
example I only want one path even if you

454
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:16,300
have more than one path I just want one

455
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,700
path and that's it it's very basic very

456
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,639
simple extension so if there's any

457
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:33,820
comments or questions please ask

458
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:36,700
Thanks are there any questions dealing

459
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:41,649
from Huawei my question is actually

460
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,950
today the the pset protocol has multiple

461
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:48,220
paths in wasting one message for example

462
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:50,500
the PC update message and but the

463
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,060
message is not carrying multiple euro

464
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,310
but carrying for example multiple a

465
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:01,480
request object each update request

466
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:04,480
object contains one else P yesterday's

467
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,140
message so I wonder I want to know

468
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:12,970
what's the gap for the today's message

469
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:15,810
for your problems here right so it was

470
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:20,820
discussed on the mailing list as well

471
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:24,559
there is a way to so basically why

472
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:28,289
kind of update corresponds to one our

473
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:32,250
set of constraints right now so what we

474
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:34,408
want here is we want one set of

475
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,789
constraints to contain multiple paths so

476
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,440
you can now have kind of two updates

477
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:41,610
because that would mean two different

478
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,289
constraints this was something that was

479
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,258
discussed in the last meeting as well

480
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:48,720
during the PC operational where we had

481
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:51,450
multiple options and the kind of

482
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,350
agreement in the room at that time was

483
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:58,169
that this is the preferred approach that

484
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:02,370
we want to have multiple er O's inside

485
00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:03,629
the path for SR policy so we can go back

486
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,850
to the what what we discuss in the

487
00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:08,519
mailing list as well as the last meeting

488
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,949
and I can discuss with you as well

489
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,750
during the offline if you need to

490
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:20,129
understand what we discussed in the last

491
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:22,830
meeting okay thank you enough my way ask

492
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:25,350
one question the mouth depends load

493
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,350
balancing or not I'll just speak louder

494
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:32,340
it's hard to hear it's a load of

495
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:35,100
balancing or not about balancing so it's

496
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:38,730
it is allowed for an equal cost multi

497
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:42,629
path so basically load balancing you can

498
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:47,490
you can send 40% traffic on one arrow

499
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:50,759
and 60% on the other I have I have an

500
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:55,019
interest on the load balancing scenario

501
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:58,230
I think I focus on folks only scenario I

502
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:01,440
have some meter one dropped her named I

503
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:05,549
can is that distribute mode I think it's

504
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:10,220
not centralized mode okay did specify

505
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:13,230
the multi pens told that device how to

506
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:17,330
how to do with a load balancing scenario

507
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:20,549
I think it's okay this is Annie I can

508
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:26,418
okay you can bring it up on the mailing

509
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:26,418
list and I can take okay thank you

510
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:31,139
ender stone Nokia just to comment on

511
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:32,610
your question about why can't we use

512
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:34,530
multiple other speeds or multiple

513
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,840
updates this use case is also

514
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,149
Keable - replication segments so I would

515
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,129
update you know a single LSP that could

516
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,990
have multiple egress paths because we're

517
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,240
doing replication and so if we were to

518
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,590
try to use Association to do that use

519
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,540
case it would just become a nightmare

520
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,879
and so you want to have you know one

521
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,490
incoming label a binding label with

522
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,680
multiple egress arrows so there's a lot

523
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,510
of use cases at this that this draft

524
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,220
really covers and so I think you know

525
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:05,310
expediting adoption of it is probably a

526
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:07,500
good good idea thanks Stephanie Lipsky

527
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:10,070
from Cisco this is just a question for

528
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,530
my information I haven't well draft yet

529
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:16,379
let's say that you have sent an update

530
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,970
message initially okay we containing

531
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,120
multiple paths and then you have just

532
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:25,290
one of these paths which is changing are

533
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,850
you always advertising both yeah

534
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:30,300
okay and you have no way to advertise

535
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:35,340
just what has changed it's justice

536
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:38,639
courses for this scenario no so we do

537
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:42,830
provide like basically per arrow ID

538
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,240
where each arrow can have an identifier

539
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,419
because I'm just wondering from an

540
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,810
implementation point of view you need to

541
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:55,200
avoid an implementation having extra

542
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:57,480
work wondering if the path has to change

543
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,520
or not yeah that's right

544
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,260
so we do provide a yellow ID there so

545
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,629
basically the the implementation can can

546
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,030
you know match the arrow from the

547
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,280
previous update to this update mmm but

548
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,470
generally when the sub date comes in

549
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,410
it's like you want you know it's a

550
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,530
single forwarding entry you know usually

551
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,070
so there is some processing involved to

552
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:28,020
compare these labels anyway so okay

553
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:31,379
thank you thanks Mike I also have a few

554
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:34,860
thoughts though since you are adding

555
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:36,360
this is a new object the first thing

556
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,360
would be that our BNF needs to be

557
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,949
updated across all the message so one

558
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,709
question to the authors would be did you

559
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,380
guys evaluate maybe adding ero

560
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:47,250
attributes as a sub object so that you

561
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,320
don't

562
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:53,460
you can still put it inside the ero list

563
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:55,139
so it still acts as a delimiter amongst

564
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,400
the path I know it's not a very neat

565
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,919
question but I just want to know that

566
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,610
did you analyze this or not can this be

567
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,020
a sub object inside the existing ero so

568
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:06,600
that you don't have to go and make a

569
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,809
huge update everywhere else yeah we we

570
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:14,850
analyzed that in fact we you know we we

571
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:16,770
very much discussed that option we found

572
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:21,658
that it it kind of makes sense easier

573
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:23,580
this way you can like yeah Rory presents

574
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:26,159
you know an explicit route you know a

575
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:29,039
particular path to you know a set of

576
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,110
labels or a set of hops now when you add

577
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,830
these like you know separator objects

578
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:37,020
into that explicit path then it becomes

579
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:42,120
I don't know it becomes a more

580
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,740
complicated object and we've we thought

581
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,439
that it's cleaner to do it this way

582
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:52,590
but if people can provide like a good

583
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:54,390
argument otherwise I wouldn't be room

584
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,850
Jenny but it works yeah I made that

585
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,370
comment last time we did like Mike said

586
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,110
we did analyze that it would have made

587
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,080
sense if there was a strong use case for

588
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,490
any transit action so since everything

589
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,090
all the attributes that we were

590
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:13,020
considering were English related

591
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:15,350
I mean there was no strong case to me

592
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,549
made for making it a gyro saab object

593
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:22,260
unless somebody brings it up this is

594
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:26,220
what ko-nach of it but in the document

595
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:27,870
do update the are BNF also i want to add

596
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,850
like if you make it a sub object then

597
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:36,389
you can't have any TVs that's not a

598
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:41,490
strong enough but then it becomes kind

599
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:43,830
of really really cool yeah yes also what

600
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:47,159
happens to our ro in this document we

601
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:47,689
have just focused on ero we also have an

602
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:51,960
RR Oh

603
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:54,690
sonar we need to talk like I know it's a

604
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,700
0/0 document but there are lots of open

605
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:00,289
questions so do try to handle that in

606
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,289
the next update yeah thanks

607
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,730
probably it's gonna be along the same

608
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,949
I'll leave my comment about the backup

609
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:10,470
when you guys actually have the text

610
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,200
okay right now I'm not able to visualize

611
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,720
how you are gonna use the backup path

612
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,940
IDs etc and how does it work without

613
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,610
existing mechanisms like protection

614
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,290
association so just think of these

615
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:26,000
questions when you update the next time

616
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:26,000
okay sounds good thanks true thank you

617
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:48,630
next we have entropy level position good

618
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,660
morning everyone I'm transitioning from

619
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:54,990
city my presentation today is the peace

620
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:58,380
app extension for SRM Piazza entropy

621
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:02,790
label position as we were long the

622
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:07,350
entropy has been proposed in RC six

623
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:10,889
seven nine zero to provide entropy for

624
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:13,919
load balancing enter the draft to ITF

625
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:18,420
MPL spring entropy label proposed to

626
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:21,929
apply the entropy labels to as RMPs

627
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:26,300
networks and it provides several

628
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:30,890
criteria to determine a year ie else

629
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:36,480
placement and so the first one is

630
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:41,730
related to computer insert a limited

631
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:44,610
number of il il pills in their SRM pious

632
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:49,080
label stack and second the inserted

633
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:54,020
positions should be within the ER LD /

634
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:59,129
Maxton maxim member / transit as ours

635
00:33:54,020 --> 00:34:01,830
finally a maximum number of ER i l PL

636
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:05,990
should be inserted why status finder

637
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:09,929
above criteria so based on the criterion

638
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:13,270
we need to consider when the controller

639
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:17,740
configure the pass when the country

640
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:21,550
is PC when PC performed their past

641
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:24,850
computation for SR MPLS networks related

642
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:28,869
to configured or entropy label precision

643
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:33,219
waster passed computation results

644
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:36,070
together to configure the results to

645
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:41,549
other networks for example as the

646
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:47,500
figures show the PC will compute their

647
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:50,340
computer parts from A to Z 2 e and the

648
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:55,780
label stack is Astor figure show and

649
00:34:50,340 --> 00:35:01,000
there are a cm piece existing in B 3 a

650
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:03,790
and B and B 3 C and E then with their PC

651
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,680
will compute the entropy label position

652
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:12,940
and for example after P and the another

653
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,600
one is after C so after ESO their label

654
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:22,000
stack waster in aro ie our labels is

655
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:27,520
Astor figures showed is the p/e l IL c e

656
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:31,450
and e RI e are so this is other motive a

657
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:36,040
a multiplication this is the background

658
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:39,189
of the drug sorry

659
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:42,550
the so we extended a piece a protocol

660
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:47,170
first we extended their open object we

661
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:51,460
add a new type of over flag to indicator

662
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:53,190
that it supposed there s our path with

663
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:57,820
the ELP

664
00:35:53,190 --> 00:36:02,609
configuration and we extend LSP objected

665
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:06,520
to indicator the peace peace each you

666
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:09,250
computed as our path waster Aoi ERP

667
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:13,150
information together and there Valerie

668
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:17,760
we will extend the ero objected to carry

669
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:22,570
the ERP information and we will extend

670
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,900
the e e flag when the e is said it

671
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:27,040
indicated that the position after the SR

672
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:31,120
ero of

673
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:37,930
is the position to insert there l ER IE

674
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:42,400
m so another extension he said i loved

675
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:45,490
history editor of c8 2 3 1 through SP

676
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:50,380
object the flag field is not enough for

677
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:54,430
the an extension their field the flag

678
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:58,480
field is trough piece that 11 piece has

679
00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:03,220
been assigned so this is it is not e

680
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:06,970
love to for other extension so this

681
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,529
document proposed to a definer liu SP

682
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:14,640
extended flag goe

683
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:17,880
to extend the lens over the flag field

684
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:28,720
so that's what this is our my

685
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:32,710
presentation any questions stephanie

686
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,080
Koski what's the value of doing this

687
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:38,560
compared to relating v ingress placing

688
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:41,049
the ELA year because even if your PC is

689
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,500
computing something it does not really

690
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:46,540
know what ingress is really able to do

691
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:50,200
so possibly ingress is not able to know

692
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:52,120
what the PC is requesting because we

693
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:55,180
think there are PC has were the

694
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:59,549
information and it has information from

695
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:04,450
a purely theoretical point of view to

696
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:06,820
what is the best position for vli years

697
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,970
unfortunately it doesn't know anything

698
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:12,640
on what is what are the capability of

699
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:17,100
ingress to really able to insert

700
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,100
multiple ela ears and wearing the stack

701
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:24,310
for me it's not working the piece of a

702
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,450
PC will collect our information like

703
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:31,029
their er LD like the MST into their a

704
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:33,700
team it's not because you have an MSD of

705
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:38,440
12 or 16 that you are able to push

706
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:40,629
multiple ela year you just configure the

707
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,450
position the placement ur that

708
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:46,090
again it's not because you have an MSD

709
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,819
which is X that you are able to push

710
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,680
multiple ela en it's really

711
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:56,860
implementation dependent and you have

712
00:38:50,680 --> 00:39:00,160
nothing to signal it so yes PC can do a

713
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:04,180
kind of optimization and give an advice

714
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:08,580
to the ingress but you have no insurance

715
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,580
that the ingress will be able to annoyed

716
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:16,660
okay and they don't cease value compared

717
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,810
to just pushing your path and ingress

718
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:28,629
doing its own job based on reads on its

719
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:34,330
own implementation I think there before

720
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:37,450
third in appearance will be inserted as

721
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:42,069
her editor ingress allowed the enter

722
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:46,509
placement the ingress and don't know

723
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:50,020
well the to welder the placement to

724
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:52,540
insert exposition to insert the ER il

725
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,790
but that PC has their information to

726
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,430
configure it

727
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:59,830
Stephan would you be happy with if a PCC

728
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,839
sends a message and say whether I was

729
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:04,990
able to succeed in doing like how we

730
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,790
usually do in Pisa or you feel that this

731
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,649
whole functionality it doesn't make

732
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,450
sense because most of the time PC would

733
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,770
never be able to give the right answer

734
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:17,770
no it could give the right answers think

735
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:21,759
that you're missing here is what our the

736
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:25,259
capability of the ingress of inserting

737
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:33,070
multiple ela Els and wearing the stack

738
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:36,220
MSD is not enough to know about that MSD

739
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:38,740
is just a generic information about how

740
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,230
many labels I'm able to push but I I

741
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:47,910
don't have any information and of what

742
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:51,610
kind of label it could be with you never

743
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:53,529
so comment on Stefan's response I agree

744
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,400
that there should be a capability saying

745
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,089
that like

746
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,579
push multiple yells and here lies but in

747
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:03,970
the multi-domain case relying on the

748
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:07,000
ingress might not you know English might

749
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:10,089
not be able to determine you know where

750
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,079
and other domains where the yell I will

751
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:21,660
go and yell so the concern is capability

752
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,660
then we should extend capability yeah

753
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,390
not just the capability that you can do

754
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:30,910
this computation but what is the

755
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:34,720
capability of the ingress when it comes

756
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:36,368
to adding multiple Li L pair so I'm not

757
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,529
sure I need to recheck whether you have

758
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:41,650
that in your open message or why are

759
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:43,420
your IEP and BGP to communicate that as

760
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,880
well so I think keep this discussion

761
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,640
going and I think start a thread on the

762
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,119
on the mailing list so that we can

763
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,460
conclude on this yeah I think their

764
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,420
capability and extension over the PGP

765
00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:01,270
and the Aces has been approved in other

766
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:04,329
yeah the dot key is usually er LD and

767
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:06,609
MSD I think what Stefan is saying that

768
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,380
that's not enough and maybe you need

769
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:10,089
something more so please go and discuss

770
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,339
and come back to the working group on

771
00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:15,430
what the conclusion was of the

772
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:19,299
discussion okay thank you about the

773
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:21,490
updates of the FCAT two three yeah yet

774
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:23,200
so I think this is an important thing

775
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:26,410
that the working group should be aware

776
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,930
of we have sort of run out of any flags

777
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:32,230
in our LSP object so we definitely

778
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:34,538
should fix this should we do this

779
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,309
independently maybe that's the best

780
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:38,950
option rather than clubbing it with this

781
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:41,770
so if you can just put this outside in a

782
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,180
separate document I think we can I agree

783
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,710
I think it would be better to manage

784
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,799
this completely separately okay

785
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,789
I feel quite as well about the instant

786
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:55,029
8tracks

787
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:57,069
oh and iran juniper

788
00:42:55,029 --> 00:43:00,459
I think there's a presentation later on

789
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:02,949
about path protection in additional

790
00:43:00,459 --> 00:43:05,618
flags for protection I guess they're

791
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:08,259
also there there are a few new LSP

792
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:11,410
attribute specific Flags being defined I

793
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:14,140
don't know he there is RC six five four

794
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,779
than zero and talks about LSP attributes

795
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,239
for RC BT the similar hop attribute

796
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:23,259
extensions which talk about mandatory

797
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:26,410
and desirable kind of semantics for LSP

798
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:28,779
attributes was was a really discussion

799
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:32,410
about replicating those semantics in

800
00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:35,529
piece up earlier on the LSP attributes

801
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,788
semantics let's discuss this when after

802
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,900
the presentation so that the working

803
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:52,559
group is aware of what you are talking

804
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:52,559
about thank you so next we have chunk

805
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:59,259
hello good morning ladies and gentlemen

806
00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:01,989
and I'm Charlie from Hawaii so my topic

807
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:10,239
today is about like the updates of PC

808
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:14,559
ECC drafts so regarding pcc see it's it

809
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:17,920
has been divided in IFC 80 to 83 and 85

810
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:21,219
s an architecture for use of PC as a

811
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,949
central controller and it exams the

812
00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:26,589
motivation and application

813
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:29,289
brigades applique parrot a four-piece

814
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:31,359
SAP a second chaplain in Sdn

815
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:35,259
architecture right so many were

816
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:38,949
discussed for drafters update so the

817
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:42,640
first one is a basic or static airspeed

818
00:44:38,949 --> 00:44:45,160
extension within the PC ECC architecture

819
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,469
so as we all know that it has been

820
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,759
adopted as a working document right now

821
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:54,009
and and this meeting the main

822
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:56,679
modification our modifications are we

823
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:58,809
update some like text for precept

824
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:01,869
requirement such as we move the

825
00:44:58,809 --> 00:45:05,890
normative things and we sync up the

826
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:07,900
changes from the PC PC percept

827
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:10,180
as a document

828
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:14,109
like we asked supports the four

829
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:17,769
link-local ipv6 address by link-local

830
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:21,788
like ipv6 at just trv something like

831
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:24,779
this and we also add the implementation

832
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:27,579
status and fix some Island section

833
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:32,109
something a dish and I think it's ready

834
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:37,029
for like working group last call so the

835
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:41,980
second one is about the PC CC extension

836
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:45,249
for SR so the main changes are very

837
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:48,269
simple we sync up with the pc c PP sap

838
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:51,009
as a document and we had some

839
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:54,430
implementation status and fix the

840
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:59,950
security considerations section and next

841
00:45:54,430 --> 00:46:02,049
it is the next like item in the walking

842
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:06,009
dock working group with the duck

843
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:07,509
adoption queue so we hope that it can be

844
00:46:06,009 --> 00:46:10,869
adopted very soon

845
00:46:07,509 --> 00:46:14,200
yep regarding the the SR v6 extensions

846
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:15,359
and Petri MPs tensions mainly we have

847
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:20,189
some auditory

848
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:24,489
changes to keep alignment with the PCC

849
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,869
CC document so nothing nothing like

850
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:32,859
major changes

851
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:36,369
so as the context as a text like a

852
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:38,828
pretty stable so we can see that if

853
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:41,980
possible we hope to add this title

854
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:46,859
documents to the working group adoption

855
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:51,539
queue on wiki so that's all thank you

856
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:51,538
any question or comments any questions

857
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:06,419
okay thank you oh thank you have

858
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:10,060
questions we have time to discuss my

859
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:12,510
wreck with juniper there is another

860
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:14,140
proposal to a program

861
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:17,440
point-to-multipoint

862
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,690
replication segment we did not present

863
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,860
it this time but I think the plan is the

864
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:26,020
result presented next time so we can we

865
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,570
can compare and contrast and talk about

866
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,700
the proposals great thank you

867
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:34,350
please use the list as much as you can

868
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,350
when you have the discussion thank you

869
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,700
so good morning everybody um here to

870
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,259
present path protection enforcement in

871
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,180
piece up Mike already made a very good

872
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,010
point it's actually local protection in

873
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,799
piece up so I think we'll probably end

874
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,660
up changing the name on that so I have a

875
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:09,819
use case here where I've got three LS

876
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,109
B's and for each of those LS B's they

877
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:12,038
have different kind of constraints on

878
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:14,200
whether or not they want to have a

879
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:16,089
protected path and by protected path we

880
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,399
really mean about whether the SIDS or

881
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:20,619
the adjacency SIDS have the beef leg set

882
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,779
and that comes from a loaf a so the

883
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:24,430
topology here is really a crazy example

884
00:48:22,779 --> 00:48:26,920
hopefully you don't see this in a real

885
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,808
network but it may happen or you've got

886
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,760
certain links which have the beef leg

887
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:32,349
set so LFA is available on those links

888
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,410
you have other links which do not have

889
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:37,869
the beef leg set and amongst for example

890
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,730
one of the links on the top left it has

891
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:41,890
both right I said which is protected and

892
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,420
I said which is not so I have LSP one

893
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,640
which says I must have a protected path

894
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,760
so in this topology there's only one

895
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,890
viable path LSP 2 says I must not have a

896
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,589
protected path it again also only has

897
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,180
one viable path whereas for LSP 3 it's

898
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:57,220
it's low effort it's low priority I

899
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,598
really just don't care so in this

900
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,180
situation you end up with three

901
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,980
potential possibilities so the idea

902
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,250
being is that to support these three

903
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,630
possibilities you know how do we tell PC

904
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:10,569
to calculate a path and take this into

905
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:13,119
consideration can I ask a clarifying

906
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:15,819
question sure what is the requirement

907
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:18,099
for must not have a protected part so

908
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,750
you might have traffic where or you

909
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:21,490
might have LS B's where just because of

910
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,930
their SLA is you actually want them to

911
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,910
go down you know high bandwidth

912
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,799
consumption consuming paths that you

913
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:28,480
rather actually drop the traffic and

914
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:30,640
fall back over to other protection

915
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:35,560
mechanisms as opposed to allowing LFA to

916
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:38,200
kick in so we have

917
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:40,210
goes with us first is to clarify some of

918
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,710
the wording so we've seen through

919
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:44,050
Interop testing in the past this was

920
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,460
actually a few years ago that different

921
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:47,890
vendors have interpreted the local

922
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,000
protection desired bit differently so I

923
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,430
did a little bit of digging to kind of

924
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,320
see where this flag came from and

925
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,270
essentially it stems from RSVP right so

926
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,580
an RSVP the LSB attributes you have a

927
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,800
local protection desired but now for

928
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,240
this bid in the case of PCE this

929
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:05,350
couldn't actually be used to influence

930
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:06,609
the CSP F the actual calculation of

931
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,910
course sigmund routing was added much

932
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:09,490
later

933
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,020
now when vendors are implementing PC and

934
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:13,390
they wanted to influence whether or not

935
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,570
an LSB should take an LFA protected path

936
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:18,190
or not they looked at this bit well the

937
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:20,440
term desired has a bit of vagueness to

938
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,450
it right I would say that neither vendor

939
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,310
implemented it right and neither vendor

940
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:26,859
implemented it wrong because you can

941
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:28,930
really truly interpret it either way in

942
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,850
the sense of whether or not protection

943
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:33,910
desired is a hard constraint or a soft

944
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:35,529
constraint so for sotl espies mckenna

945
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:37,060
just showed in the previous example we

946
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:39,820
actually want to influence the see SPF

947
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,490
calculation so first goal is to clarify

948
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:45,220
some of the wording in the document and

949
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:47,200
the second goal is to add an additional

950
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,000
way to signify that strictness right

951
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,470
whether or not I must have or it must

952
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:55,540
not have or I don't care so the proposal

953
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:57,790
that we're doing is well first some

954
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,410
additional wording it must be said that

955
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,060
the wording that's being added to the

956
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,069
document is trying to be as

957
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,360
backwards-compatible as possible right

958
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,910
because we do have implementations out

959
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,920
there so it is a little bit flexible in

960
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:11,049
in how we're treating the existing local

961
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,920
protection desired but for that reason

962
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:16,480
and another reason the the actual

963
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,890
proposal to achieve that strictness

964
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,540
constraint we're looking at adding

965
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,089
another flag so we're calling it the e

966
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,340
flag now you could argue that you know

967
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:26,740
asking for a protected or non protected

968
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,840
flag is a constraint of the SI SPF

969
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,790
calculation not necessarily an attribute

970
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,460
the problem is including that data

971
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:35,070
structure is relatively quite heavy plus

972
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,180
then you end up having a split between

973
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:39,190
what what does the local protection

974
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:41,259
desired bit mean if I also have a

975
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,390
constraint so I figured it'd be easier

976
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,790
to tag along the local protected desired

977
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:47,799
but with this new e bit so the

978
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:49,029
combination of the e and the L bits if

979
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,469
you read the draft basic

980
00:51:49,029 --> 00:51:54,849
they allow you to have four individual

981
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:56,289
states right to bits on and off so the

982
00:51:54,849 --> 00:51:58,749
waiting in there is again backwards

983
00:51:56,289 --> 00:52:02,349
compatibility and trying to achieve the

984
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:03,729
first use case I presented and so that's

985
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:05,019
really an in my presentation at this

986
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:07,749
moment we're basically just looking for

987
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:09,158
feedback comments especially from those

988
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:11,288
vendors who have implemented it to see

989
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:16,089
how this achieves still backwards

990
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:18,039
compatibility hello it's Michael Cole

991
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:22,828
the chef from Cisco yeah I think it's

992
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:26,079
very useful actually this unprotected

993
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:27,549
path to say basically like it must be

994
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,289
unprotected versus at me

995
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:32,259
you know we prefer unprotected versus it

996
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:39,880
must be unprotected those are actual you

997
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:43,869
know use cases for sure so thanks upon

998
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,849
you want to discuss your point or if

999
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,769
it's the same question can I ask a

1000
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:50,969
little bit more about this document

1001
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:53,589
before we go to a bigger discussion or

1002
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:57,159
after you yeah I don't have any comment

1003
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:58,419
about the desire let me finish okay so I

1004
00:52:57,159 --> 00:53:02,529
have a few questions

1005
00:52:58,419 --> 00:53:05,589
so maybe you can clarify one I was just

1006
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:09,249
reading out of c-54 4-0 it I know the

1007
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:12,279
name of the bit is desired but the text

1008
00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:14,649
says when set the path computation must

1009
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:16,959
include links protected by FRR I know

1010
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:19,569
the must is not in a normative way it's

1011
00:53:16,959 --> 00:53:22,569
in a small letters but I think it's a

1012
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:24,369
bit clearer I found that text odd

1013
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:26,439
because that was written before segment

1014
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:29,709
routing existed and so there was no way

1015
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:31,209
for PC to actually influence as part of

1016
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:32,859
it see SPF calculation whether or not

1017
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:36,308
protection would actually be supported

1018
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:38,259
by the downstream RSVP router right so

1019
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:39,969
at the time as much as the language said

1020
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:41,739
you know was a hard constraint the point

1021
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:44,529
is it couldn't actually influence as

1022
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:48,549
part of the see SPF calculation and I'm

1023
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:51,400
not sold on that so let me so again I

1024
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:52,569
agree it definitely does say must and

1025
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,150
again when you stand back to you the

1026
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:57,219
point that it references to the RSVP RFC

1027
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:59,409
and that situation it does imply that

1028
00:53:57,219 --> 00:54:01,359
it's also a soft constraint so that

1029
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:02,740
that's why I mentioned you know there's

1030
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,690
no right or wrong

1031
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:06,669
out there it's just the wording can be

1032
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:08,470
interpreted differently and to achieve

1033
00:54:06,670 --> 00:54:12,359
for example these three potential

1034
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:15,310
options of must must not have don't care

1035
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:18,630
trying to you know bridge those two

1036
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,630
worlds together between the two flags

1037
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:26,650
okay also I think I would like to have a

1038
00:54:24,339 --> 00:54:30,549
don't care option I think that we have

1039
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:33,310
lost now so you would like or would not

1040
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:35,830
like no currently what we had was if I

1041
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:38,140
set a flag either I mean I must or

1042
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:41,440
desired and if I don't set a flag we

1043
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:44,830
don't care and right now based on your

1044
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,609
adding of these two flags if I unset

1045
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:48,520
both the flags

1046
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:50,170
it would mean either rate right now when

1047
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,390
both flags are set zero it actually

1048
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:53,950
means I don't care but you end up in a

1049
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:55,480
situation where you might have a link

1050
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:57,430
with multiple seeds on it some which

1051
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,869
have protection and some that don't so

1052
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,580
for the backwards compatibility it's

1053
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:02,320
falling back to saying will prefer the

1054
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,430
one that does have protection because at

1055
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:07,300
the end of a you have to choose one and

1056
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:09,399
so the the use case actually has three

1057
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,599
states but because of the bits I

1058
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,359
basically said well let's have the four

1059
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:15,520
states so you've got unprotected I don't

1060
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,040
care right where everything said zero

1061
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,630
and then you have protected or you have

1062
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,630
a protected preference but I don't care

1063
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:27,279
so III feel it's a bit conflicting

1064
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:29,230
because once you say that something is

1065
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,060
preferred actually you do care because

1066
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:33,310
you are using the word preferred there

1067
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:36,099
sure the the preference is more about

1068
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:37,930
trying to control the selection of which

1069
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:40,390
sit to use on a link which has multiple

1070
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:42,580
sets so the way preferred I agree we can

1071
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:44,230
probably tune that wording what a base

1072
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,150
people's down to is one influence is the

1073
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:48,130
see SPF calculation the other one

1074
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:53,380
influences the SID selection along a

1075
00:55:48,130 --> 00:56:00,450
link from that posts SPF calculation any

1076
00:55:53,380 --> 00:56:00,450
other comments bubble flow to you

1077
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:12,670
no need to rush yeah the earlier comment

1078
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:16,240
was that now that we are trying to add

1079
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:19,230
more and more flags to LSP attributes we

1080
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,750
do have precedence in our CBT for

1081
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:24,460
attribute flax TL we have things like

1082
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:26,370
that and there is an R flag which tells

1083
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:30,100
you whether that's required or desired

1084
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:32,680
so the question was do we bring those

1085
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:35,020
semantics into pfpc always had peace of

1086
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:37,660
always had the LSP a object with a

1087
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,320
subtly squirt there is precedence in

1088
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,649
RSVP

1089
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,180
should we bring that in here has there

1090
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:44,920
been a discussion in the past I am sure

1091
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,850
there was some discussion sue can

1092
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:50,890
recollect the regarding optional and

1093
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:53,830
mandatory we had it at the object level

1094
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:56,200
so that as you know in RFC 5/4 that was

1095
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:58,029
there from the start we missed it in the

1096
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,919
stateful so there is another document

1097
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:03,280
that was discussed I think last two last

1098
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:06,190
ITF where how we made sure that those

1099
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,380
flags are are applicable at the object

1100
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,390
level at a flag level we don't have a

1101
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,910
mechanism so if there is something that

1102
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,460
already exists yes a good reference to

1103
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:18,520
look at and maybe a generic solution

1104
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:22,290
rather than pearl flag could be useful

1105
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,290
yeah thank you thanks for bringing it up

1106
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,170
as some from nook here I was just

1107
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:37,630
reading at the statement that you

1108
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:39,840
brought from our c-54 can you closer the

1109
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:44,590
statement that you borrowed from Arcee

1110
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:46,960
54:40 that it says that the path must

1111
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:49,990
include links protected with the faster

1112
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:53,620
iran yes but it doesn't say what happens

1113
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:56,919
if you cannot find a link that has fast

1114
00:57:53,620 --> 00:58:02,319
you rot and I think this is to have

1115
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:05,260
cleared up because in that network there

1116
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:09,130
is a case that you might your only path

1117
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:10,900
doesn't have the faster ah so my

1118
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:13,980
interpretation from desired means that

1119
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:16,420
we should take into account no I I

1120
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,970
understand what the requirement was my

1121
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:20,250
only

1122
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,799
was that the it's a bit of a strong

1123
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:24,660
statement to say it RFC for for zero was

1124
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,030
too ambiguous I think it's as an

1125
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:30,240
implementers we might have interpreted

1126
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:35,130
it differently so we need to fix that

1127
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:46,348
I understand but yeah yeah I agree let's

1128
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:49,560
go ahead thank you thank you is who I'm

1129
00:58:46,349 --> 00:58:51,960
on the room I think because we are

1130
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,940
running little early so I think he let's

1131
00:58:51,960 --> 00:59:03,510
move to the next presentation and we'll

1132
00:58:53,940 --> 00:59:06,119
come back to it hurry just update that

1133
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:10,200
in the meeting just a reshuffling of the

1134
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:12,359
order the video okay good morning

1135
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:16,799
this is Hama and I'm presenting this

1136
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:19,319
marathon protest extension to PC to spur

1137
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,300
to resource sharing and this has been

1138
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:25,020
presented last time I think in Singapore

1139
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:27,720
as well and let's try to recap what has

1140
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,970
been included in draft to give a

1141
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:33,089
reminder on the technical part so

1142
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:37,169
basically this kind this work has a

1143
00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:39,210
scope to support the explicit to

1144
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,880
resource sharing strategy when you do

1145
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:44,880
the past computation and especially this

1146
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:48,119
can be applied when a new era SP is used

1147
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:52,530
to replace an existing SR RSP such as

1148
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:54,750
reoptimize ation or restauration and the

1149
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:57,000
solution has been defined in this

1150
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:59,580
document who would support the resource

1151
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,180
variance between the two errors piece

1152
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:06,930
with different parameters like endpoints

1153
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:11,129
bandwidth and link share no share so on

1154
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:13,770
so forth so we have already coordinated

1155
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:16,430
with other documentation this working

1156
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:19,290
group especially with the ones for

1157
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:22,500
Association so the Association would be

1158
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:25,279
used as a generic object and we have

1159
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:27,810
separate TR ways if you want to compute

1160
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,800
diversity at the end if you want to

1161
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:32,160
compute in sharing strategy so what we

1162
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:35,309
have

1163
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:38,520
being proposal proposed in this document

1164
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:42,839
is to reuse the association group object

1165
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:48,109
and indicated a new Association type as

1166
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:51,240
sharing so this is how the newly

1167
01:00:48,109 --> 01:00:55,170
introduced that here will looks like so

1168
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:58,740
we have setting we have said a few flags

1169
01:00:55,170 --> 01:01:01,260
here to indicate what is the strategy

1170
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:04,348
and what is the objective for you to to

1171
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:07,440
to share during the past computation

1172
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:10,680
request so we can have link share node

1173
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:16,920
share as our energy share for different

1174
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:19,049
kind of objective and the preceding rule

1175
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,200
for this kind of sharing would be say

1176
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:25,799
well if we share a link propose to share

1177
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:29,160
a link the PCU the PCE you will firstly

1178
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:34,049
try to share the link and if it is

1179
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:37,740
possible to fail so if the link share

1180
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:40,140
try is failed then the PC will try to

1181
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:46,910
find the past without link share so this

1182
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:50,368
is different to with a kind of mandatory

1183
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:53,879
constraint and the same rule applies to

1184
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:59,130
the node share and s energy share as

1185
01:01:53,880 --> 01:02:02,460
well so what has been newly added in the

1186
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:06,589
recent updater is a B flag PFLAG would

1187
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:10,589
be used to do the bandwidth sharing

1188
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:13,529
which is used for the bulk pass

1189
01:02:10,589 --> 01:02:17,670
commutation and this would be used to

1190
01:02:13,529 --> 01:02:19,740
see we can have many recipes using the

1191
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:24,930
same bandwidth but it's a kind of

1192
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:28,439
planning instead of real deployment so

1193
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:31,169
the changes has been made in maybe

1194
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,450
recent over a year would be we updated

1195
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:36,599
the some of the description in the use

1196
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:39,689
case section to harmonize with other

1197
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:44,250
kind of past computation strategies and

1198
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:45,900
we also updated the error code to be

1199
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:49,500
consistent with

1200
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:51,470
a Association abre and we add a

1201
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:55,160
description on the manageability

1202
01:02:51,470 --> 01:03:00,180
considerations and we also have other

1203
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:01,819
editorial comments according to the the

1204
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:07,259
comments raised on the list

1205
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:10,109
so this one has been pulled once we it

1206
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,849
seems it was good support in in an

1207
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:12,180
on-site meeting but not on the mailing

1208
01:03:11,849 --> 01:03:15,450
list

1209
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:18,419
so according to the wiki and the

1210
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:20,669
requirement firm chairs we are requested

1211
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:24,539
to have more reviews and more supporters

1212
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:28,289
so we now get them and we are now get

1213
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:31,740
better harmonized with other Association

1214
01:03:28,289 --> 01:03:34,380
works so we think this work harmony is

1215
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:38,930
ready for the second round of working

1216
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:46,559
group adoption thank you

1217
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:49,529
add any questions hi this is Mike from

1218
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:54,299
Cisco you most you seem to only talk

1219
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:56,339
about PC requests in the draft so in the

1220
01:03:54,299 --> 01:04:00,509
PC requests it's kind of clear because

1221
01:03:56,339 --> 01:04:02,130
there is one say OSP that's there

1222
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:04,859
already and then you're just requesting

1223
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:06,779
the other one so you can't modify the

1224
01:04:04,859 --> 01:04:09,598
one that's already there but if it's

1225
01:04:06,779 --> 01:04:12,420
like stateful then you have two USBs in

1226
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:16,440
this Association group and then it may

1227
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:18,180
be not very clear if you change one then

1228
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,130
you kind of force to change the other

1229
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:24,808
because it's supposed to share yeah good

1230
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:27,869
catch actually the the approach should

1231
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:30,480
applies to both say less and stateful we

1232
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:32,700
did mention the stay

1233
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,349
I think PC request in in the document

1234
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:38,399
but should be also includes those

1235
01:04:34,349 --> 01:04:41,150
stateful part as the Association is the

1236
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:44,130
generic and can apply for mouse

1237
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:45,779
stateless and stateful okay but like

1238
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:48,390
from the path computation point of view

1239
01:04:45,779 --> 01:04:51,839
I guess if you like change one other

1240
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:53,299
speed and you're kind of yeah you want

1241
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,160
to change the other one yeah I guess

1242
01:04:53,299 --> 01:04:58,589
thanks Mike that's kind of applicable to

1243
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,850
almost all associations in stateful

1244
01:04:58,589 --> 01:05:02,190
world

1245
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:06,730
yeah thanks I just wanted to clarify

1246
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:09,340
okay how many of you have read this

1247
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:15,760
document either before in an earlier

1248
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:18,040
version or the latest one quite a few

1249
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:21,880
people have read so I hope that if we do

1250
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:24,370
a second call we will actually see you

1251
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:26,770
guys respond on the list because if you

1252
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:29,080
support on the list all the consensus

1253
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:32,200
will be judged only on the mailing lists

1254
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:34,930
so please if we do the second call I

1255
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:37,509
have to talk to Julian before we take a

1256
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:41,850
decision on this but everybody who's

1257
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:44,530
took the hand and hurry maybe no doubt

1258
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:46,210
raised their hand that we need to get

1259
01:05:44,530 --> 01:06:03,940
more answers on the list thank you

1260
01:05:46,210 --> 01:06:06,210
thanks thank you in the middle sorry

1261
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,210
about that

1262
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:20,930
[Music]

1263
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:24,319
hello everyone my topic today is the

1264
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:29,930
pizza a PCT concentrates for network

1265
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:32,630
slicing the motivation motivation is

1266
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:35,538
that according to their 5g contest

1267
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:38,710
satellite network slicing is there a

1268
01:06:35,539 --> 01:06:42,019
collection of a set of topology to

1269
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:46,509
support network service differentiation

1270
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:49,549
and their meeting third I first find

1271
01:06:46,509 --> 01:06:54,700
requirements from the vertical

1272
01:06:49,549 --> 01:06:59,559
industries so the slices may be seen as

1273
01:06:54,700 --> 01:07:04,930
virtual networks and the topologies from

1274
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:08,539
PC will be a partitioned - to be

1275
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:12,890
Manning's sub and sub technologies in

1276
01:07:08,539 --> 01:07:16,099
transport network so so for now

1277
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:18,469
multiple existing and then fires can be

1278
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:21,829
used at you intent finder virtual

1279
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:27,289
network resource and we must consider

1280
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:30,289
this - to be viewed as constraints of

1281
01:07:27,289 --> 01:07:33,799
that work slicing when your PC is

1282
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:37,940
deployed so as the figures show when we

1283
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:42,349
used PC to configure their transport

1284
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:45,319
network when first the application based

1285
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:48,619
the service will configured by users to

1286
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:54,079
PC and the PC will collect collect

1287
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:55,029
apology from bt pls and I will use the P

1288
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,329
sub

1289
01:07:55,029 --> 01:08:04,249
protocol to configure their networks so

1290
01:07:58,329 --> 01:08:08,119
the PC you used will after or apologist

1291
01:08:04,249 --> 01:08:12,468
in dirt traffic engineering database so

1292
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:16,250
the traffic engineering the base will be

1293
01:08:12,469 --> 01:08:21,649
divided into many technologies when

1294
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:25,969
they're slicing network user and then

1295
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:30,348
fires two parties pain part

1296
01:08:25,969 --> 01:08:33,739
shishun the resources so we need to

1297
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:37,999
consider the constraints to their

1298
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:41,749
computer take the past computation so we

1299
01:08:37,999 --> 01:08:45,828
propose to define several key

1300
01:08:41,749 --> 01:08:47,269
constraints for networks slicing the

1301
01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:51,469
first one is the network topology

1302
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:55,279
information the source protocol ID Marty

1303
01:08:51,469 --> 01:08:59,078
Marty topology ID and the other means to

1304
01:08:55,279 --> 01:09:03,469
achieve instance identifier oh they are

1305
01:08:59,078 --> 01:09:08,439
displays are defined in other drugs and

1306
01:09:03,469 --> 01:09:11,809
for its proposal for network slicing

1307
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:14,778
next one is the policy information it is

1308
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:18,909
proposed in ITF spring segment routing

1309
01:09:14,779 --> 01:09:23,589
policy this is the color template to

1310
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:29,210
configure der surface so as topology so

1311
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:33,139
we need to consider the color template

1312
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:35,689
when we computer the past master one is

1313
01:09:33,139 --> 01:09:39,979
the application of tributes defined in

1314
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:42,618
ieee tah-tah and their arbitration based

1315
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:45,799
the service we are configured to pcs or

1316
01:09:42,618 --> 01:09:50,598
PC you need to consider the constraints

1317
01:09:45,799 --> 01:09:55,719
true first one the stress protocol like

1318
01:09:50,599 --> 01:10:00,460
for example easiest OSPF or

1319
01:09:55,719 --> 01:10:04,760
configuration the other typo for the

1320
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:08,300
protocol we were collector and OPC wear

1321
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:14,079
collector the topology based on this

1322
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:19,579
base protocol the advisement so when we

1323
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:25,159
computer the passes used using the PC we

1324
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:30,018
will carry their constraints or tell the

1325
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:36,799
PC to selector the their source protocol

1326
01:10:30,019 --> 01:10:39,170
and to concentrate order passed last one

1327
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:39,830
is the same there are a market apology

1328
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:43,040
when we

1329
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:46,940
find at much lower GI D we will just a

1330
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:49,930
computer to pass in the sub topology

1331
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:55,400
which defined either much topology ID

1332
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:58,880
and the third one is the slicing network

1333
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:02,420
network of mr. Adam illustrative

1334
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:06,310
instance identifiers this is defined in

1335
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:11,060
the draft just for the network slicing

1336
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:15,140
so it when we a computer the past we

1337
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:20,720
were late to carry their a I I objected

1338
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:25,960
to limit emulate the topology the color

1339
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:32,570
object is defined under SR s not our

1340
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:34,670
policy so when the sabotage topology

1341
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:38,480
identified by the specific color

1342
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:42,580
template then will this will carried

1343
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:47,530
specif specific color perm you later

1344
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:51,559
so when we computer the past we were

1345
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:54,880
carried the color template and there we

1346
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:59,840
will carry the color object to

1347
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:03,520
concentrate other parts so the master

1348
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,930
one is application attributes the

1349
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,960
obligation application based took

1350
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:11,120
service will configure to OPC and then

1351
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:14,600
configure to the let works when we

1352
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:16,900
computer their passes we were lead to

1353
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:22,190
carry their application attributes to

1354
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:25,910
limiter the topology so they say these

1355
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:29,179
are the several constraints we extend

1356
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:31,660
for the peace app that's were any

1357
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,660
questions

1358
01:12:41,739 --> 01:12:45,900
thank you okay thank you

1359
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:14,019
colonial one Amazon from a leaky today I

1360
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:18,070
will talk about PCE kisses for PRT watch

1361
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:21,070
the latest version we add cruisers from

1362
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:25,179
Huawei and China BIOS in this version

1363
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:28,870
and we update we have received a couple

1364
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:34,180
of comments from from Europe and the way

1365
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:37,960
update the endpoint object zero are two

1366
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:41,350
options in our draft but we've delayed

1367
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:43,900
the option for the new year and point

1368
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:47,170
object to carry it appear ID

1369
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:50,440
informations we use is a bit wonky in

1370
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:52,990
points objects body for ipv4 and end

1371
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:59,200
points a particular body for ipv6 which

1372
01:13:52,990 --> 01:14:02,769
is defined in fz8 3006 next introduction

1373
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:07,120
this document specifies åkesson should

1374
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:10,570
pass through to pc EP that allows a

1375
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:16,840
still for PCE to compute and initiate

1376
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:22,420
the patch for beauty this is the disease

1377
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:25,660
like this is for pcp the first a spear

1378
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:29,230
capability at a water Esmond defines a

1379
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:31,980
new past settlement type for beer for

1380
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:34,929
beer te defines the beauty PCB

1381
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:39,129
capability such a way to exchange beer

1382
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:43,060
capability as a second is to up he is AB

1383
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:43,990
the object defines a new path set up for

1384
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:47,890
beauty

1385
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:49,929
the third is end point object we use is

1386
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:54,310
a bit wonky and point object

1387
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:57,640
body yeah the last is a yellow object

1388
01:14:54,310 --> 01:15:00,100
with the files a year oh yeah period or

1389
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:07,660
sub objects to carriage at the say speed

1390
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:12,270
stress PSAR subdomain and i sigh so this

1391
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:16,120
draft is six verses and we have some

1392
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:17,650
partitions many times both the peer and

1393
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:21,010
VCE welcome

1394
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:27,659
and we have received a couple of

1395
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:33,219
comments from from from our readers like

1396
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:36,429
China Mobile and Huawei sorry Wow so I

1397
01:15:33,219 --> 01:15:40,060
think this this draft is ready to

1398
01:15:36,429 --> 01:15:42,520
college so I asked a working group to

1399
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:53,020
cover double shame for our draft thank

1400
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:56,320
you are there any questions so thank you

1401
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:58,449
for addressing the comment from mailing

1402
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:02,110
list and otherwise and making it clear

1403
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:06,610
that this document deals with BRT only

1404
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:09,489
do you have any plans for the PCC c4

1405
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:12,849
yeah yeah yeah sure we have a plan and

1406
01:16:09,489 --> 01:16:14,559
we we also we would like to incorporate

1407
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:19,900
with with you

1408
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:23,830
yeah with Huawei go on to extend PCB say

1409
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:29,138
say to to beer to beer

1410
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:32,380
okay I discussed to with the beer Cheers

1411
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:33,639
I think to IETF segoe regarding this

1412
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:36,880
work

1413
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:39,100
I will reconfirm with the ad and the

1414
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,010
beer cheers how to best progress this

1415
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:43,750
work most likely since this is a piece

1416
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:46,150
of extension so the best place is

1417
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:47,920
definitely this working group but how do

1418
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,929
we coordinate and make sure that the

1419
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,510
beer requirements are well captured and

1420
01:16:49,929 --> 01:16:54,580
whether we are meeting the requirements

1421
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:57,010
that's something by a coordination

1422
01:16:54,580 --> 01:17:00,400
across the beer working group and PC

1423
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:03,630
working group we can take care of how

1424
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,629
many people have read this document

1425
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:15,040
thank you how many of you think that

1426
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:15,849
this work is useful thank you thank you

1427
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,460
thanks for the input

1428
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:21,820
I'll anyway take this to the list and we

1429
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:22,780
have an adoption queue so bear with us

1430
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,989
thank you

1431
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:28,059
sticking Obama's okay so we have last

1432
01:17:25,989 --> 01:17:31,209
presentation but our presenter is still

1433
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:34,780
not here I think

1434
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:37,330
any information yes he is involved in

1435
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:41,139
another presentation another working

1436
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:43,630
group so he promised me to come later so

1437
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:45,850
we would like to request for chairs to

1438
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:49,420
decide whether to wait for him or we do

1439
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:52,660
what else does anybody has anything else

1440
01:17:49,420 --> 01:18:01,630
to discuss any other thing that they are

1441
01:17:52,660 --> 01:18:08,200
bothering bothered by life and Ranocchia

1442
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:10,420
Singapore is really warm I think that

1443
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:13,000
document was discussed last time in the

1444
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:17,080
last meeting as well though whoever was

1445
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:18,880
remote he had made an update but I think

1446
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:22,000
the key question they are still open

1447
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:24,160
that is the motivation behind that work

1448
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,970
this that work was discussed in BGP

1449
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:29,950
as well so I think we should waiting may

1450
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:33,190
not be the best idea of everybody's time

1451
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:35,290
so thank you thanks for attending the

1452
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:40,950
working group and being quite efficient

1453
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:40,950
you have 45 minutes to enjoy thank you

1454
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:59,980
blue sheets has everybody signed the

1455
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:03,459
blue sheet if somebody some of you

1456
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:05,639
making late make sure it's updated thank

1457
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,640
you

1458
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:28,888
keep the empty empty flood and then if

1459
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,889
you're talking use the
