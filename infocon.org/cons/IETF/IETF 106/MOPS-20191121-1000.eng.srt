3
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,909
right good morning everybody thanks for

4
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,540
making it out to this chill working

5
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:03,629
group room for the inaugural mops

6
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,429
working group session I think you're

7
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,170
familiar with II know well and you

8
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,500
should note it well

9
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,578
all the usual conditions for

10
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:19,799
participating in the IETF apply um a

11
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:22,200
couple of bits of administrivia assuming

12
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,810
there are no bashes to the agenda we

13
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,548
have blue sheets that are about ready to

14
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:34,859
circulate are circulating Glen did are

15
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:36,690
about to circulate um I understand that

16
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,760
we are in that several people have a

17
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,980
conflict with the TSV working group

18
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,918
that's on at the same time so I expect

19
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,410
there will be people coming in and going

20
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,750
out for different agenda items in either

21
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,340
working group and we've noted that we

22
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,669
should make sure not to collide with

23
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,799
that working group going forward so

24
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:58,650
there's that but it also means that we

25
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,049
have a javis tribe Thank You Aaron

26
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,449
but we don't actually have a note-taker

27
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:05,400
at this point is there anybody willing

28
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:14,609
to be a note-taker for this session

29
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:15,090
please don't all volunteer at once Thank

30
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:20,370
You Ronnie

31
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:23,430
um so okay great thank you very much we

32
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,370
can move on so are there any batches to

33
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:33,060
the agenda that's been posted for a week

34
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:35,760
or so see me not moving on yeah

35
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,440
so this is our inaugural working group

36
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,060
meeting we have met several times before

37
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,990
in multiple contexts and different

38
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,150
guises so I just wanted to remind people

39
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,520
of what our what our Charter says

40
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,340
there's a lot of soliciting of input

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,099
here and regular updates so this is the

42
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,638
general area of focus for this working

43
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,990
group and what you're gonna what we're

44
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,830
going to talk about this morning has a

45
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,150
lot to do with updates from various I'm

46
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:13,440
actually supposed to stand on this pink

47
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:16,080
thing of them much better now I can talk

48
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,680
to the mic microphone stand so there

49
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:24,330
will be a lot of updates from other from

50
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,650
other areas from other organizations one

51
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,300
of the things that I want to do with

52
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,299
this session because it is a working

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,630
group and and not just a conference

54
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,120
session is start to work out our mode of

55
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,560
operation so I'm hoping that we will

56
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,510
actually have some interactive

57
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,900
discussion around some of the things

58
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,270
that are presented in terms of you know

59
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,299
ask questions about stuff as being

60
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,389
presented on work going on elsewhere we

61
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,280
have one discussion of you know an

62
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:56,100
awareness-raising with regards to an

63
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,719
issue with streaming and quick we can

64
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,450
have a discussion after that

65
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,979
presentation about you know is there is

66
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,409
our further follow on what do we think

67
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:08,580
about it so on and so forth so generally

68
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,220
speaking just all that say that this

69
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,270
really should be a I'm hoping this will

70
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,950
be an interactive session

71
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,849
notwithstanding the fact that it is

72
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,840
Thursday morning after a very long week

73
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,289
thankfully it's not Friday morning after

74
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,549
a very long week okay all right so

75
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:27,919
unless there's any questions so far

76
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:31,520
[Music]

77
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,139
yeah this is just a further note about

78
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,498
my earlier point about what we're here

79
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:39,259
to do our outputs are meant to be some

80
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:41,270
documents the presentations that get

81
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:43,310
posted in Proceedings for all see and

82
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,409
also potentially some dispatch like

83
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,979
activities where we might refer people

84
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:51,110
to other working groups that last aspect

85
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,419
I think will be particularly useful when

86
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,599
we have people who you know join our

87
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,340
efforts from other organizations who may

88
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,748
not know I may not know where to go in

89
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,989
the IETF or may not know where to take

90
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:06,770
their work within the IETF so that's

91
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:24,319
sort of the general context and that's

92
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:27,549
it for me so next up Jake hey Jay Colin

93
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:32,680
and I was gonna give an update on the

94
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,680
the one document we have so far thanks

95
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:41,270
okay so the doc status I think it went

96
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,889
on to the milestones list when we first

97
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,628
started the working group or something

98
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,539
but I don't think it's been adopted by

99
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:50,240
the working group and I'm not sure

100
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,699
whether that counts as consensus or not

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,430
I guess probably not anyway

102
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:59,990
we probably should discuss that and make

103
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,000
a decision the some of the offline

104
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,199
comments last time there were some there

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,610
were several supportive comments of the

106
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,169
general direction

107
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:11,449
a few refinements and a few people seem

108
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:14,029
to indicate that it's it's not totally

109
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,699
clear that that the duct is super useful

110
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:19,699
but I'm not sure whether that means that

111
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:23,719
that we should refine it until it's more

112
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:27,680
useful or that the general concept at

113
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:30,800
all is is it not necessarily worth

114
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,089
writing down so a little discussion on

115
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,089
that would be lovely

116
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,169
yeah I

117
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,349
haven't actually touched it since since

118
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:44,710
supposed to hit last time but I do have

119
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:47,820
a few there was some feedback from ollie

120
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:50,790
so I have a few - dues to put in there

121
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,740
and I think that the suggestion from

122
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,290
from lastly that this is not a taxonomy

123
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:01,420
it's a operational considerations for

124
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:04,719
media streaming for from edges indicates

125
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,439
changing the name as we perhaps adopt it

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:15,430
and and put it forward and then there's

127
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:17,410
the I would say the kind of most there

128
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,420
is some a lot of the feedback I got is

129
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,770
that there is one really good insight

130
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,750
that it would be great to get in there

131
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,500
somehow which is the sort of mismatch

132
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:30,040
between the capacity and the demand for

133
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,930
like large-scale events and you know in

134
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,240
the sense of presenting it with good

135
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,949
archival value this is these are the

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,899
slides that I had last time I think I've

137
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,350
shown them a few times it's you know

138
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:44,589
just the the when you when you take a

139
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,000
kind of large scale number actually

140
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:47,020
published a new number since then I

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,810
probably should have read on the math a

142
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:53,140
little bit so it would move up I Oh call

143
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:56,229
it 2.4 million instead but the this the

144
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,180
core insight is the same it's just that

145
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,650
when you take a sort of large-scale

146
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:08,250
provider just the the thing that they're

147
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:12,120
able to do even even a good-sized CDN is

148
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:15,070
it doesn't match the sort of real

149
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,579
capacity to consume the popular things

150
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:22,120
from the audience size even with the

151
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:24,160
demand we have today and you know it's

152
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,130
not clear depending which numbers you

153
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,510
look at like how much worse it's getting

154
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,420
and how much better it's getting in a

155
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:36,370
different time so the best idea I have

156
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,449
on how to capture this in a sort of you

157
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:40,450
know

158
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,470
an insight that applies across time is

159
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,800
maybe the trendline

160
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:47,830
with the accumulated annualized growth

161
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,020
duration rate or something I'm not sure

162
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:55,020
that's good I would love suggestions on

163
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:57,520
how to do it better and just other

164
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:00,430
suggestions on what should or should not

165
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,850
be in the stock would be very welcome

166
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:07,719
so that is my update do we have any

167
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:11,490
questions discussion adoption calls that

168
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,180
the chairs would like to perform etc

169
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:18,640
thank you Jake

170
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:20,890
so maybe we can start with opinions on

171
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,819
that last point about what is an actual

172
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,770
useful way to explain or articulate the

173
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:31,180
demand versus capacity disconnect that

174
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:33,130
you were describing in this graph in a

175
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:37,229
useful way that will be worth publishing

176
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,230
for archival purposes

177
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:48,220
Kyle Rose Akamai how about just if you

178
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:53,260
were to unicast all of this traffic how

179
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:57,220
much bandwidth would that be so I put a

180
00:11:53,260 --> 00:12:03,280
formula in there one for how much it is

181
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:06,840
per you know per stream with with

182
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,339
unicast and did a couple of example

183
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,990
example multiplication is to say if you

184
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,470
have this many millions of years it

185
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,140
means this much bandwidth it doesn't

186
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,560
really make that point you know in as

187
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,569
punchy away as the as the mismatch does

188
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,910
right it just presents the raw number

189
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,490
the oh if you have half a million users

190
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:31,689
you need you know 600 gigabits which may

191
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:35,650
or may not be easy you know in two years

192
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:38,590
time but or today it's just the the

193
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,730
question of like there is a mapping but

194
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,830
making the point that there is a

195
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,740
mismatch and that the mismatch has been

196
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,750
sort of growing and persistent and and

197
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,870
problematic is the part where I feel

198
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:55,510
like it's it's weak and could use a

199
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:59,230
proved presentation in a way that that

200
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:01,390
still carries some punch right with

201
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,770
recognition that moving forward networks

202
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,330
changed right that's that's like the

203
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,210
part the part that I'm struggling to

204
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,890
really communicate in the document so

205
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,290
this is the best idea I've got so far I

206
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:15,000
think it could be improved in and I'm

207
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:21,339
looking for suggestions yeah thank you

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,830
Mark Nottingham cold just thinking out

209
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,810
loud maybe it would help to kind of dive

210
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,940
into where you think the constraints are

211
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,550
you know like you know these are big

212
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,740
numbers and you know but but the

213
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:35,290
Internet has grown over time and CDN

214
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,089
capacities have grown over time is it

215
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,130
you know is it last mile probably not I

216
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,750
mean at least where I live everybody's

217
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,510
getting hundred mega bitten more pretty

218
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,540
soon you know is is it middle mile maybe

219
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,850
that's more interesting is it CPU is it

220
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,709
is it network card is is it the

221
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,320
economics of your current relationships

222
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:56,020
you know maybe just unpick those bits

223
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,720
might help a little bit that's a good

224
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,480
point thank you yeah the in some cases

225
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,170
it is the access networks in a sense it

226
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:09,040
is inherently the kind of global

227
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:12,969
provider in some kind of you know which

228
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,560
may be multiple yeah thank you that's

229
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,860
good there's another dimension to this

230
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,650
which a Dave or Ansari which be really

231
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,730
useful to capture which is that people

232
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,310
tend to assume there's a high

233
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:29,290
correlation between the very high demand

234
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:30,699
content and live content and to some

235
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,770
extent that's true if it's a football

236
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,720
game or a rock concert or something like

237
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:37,300
that but there's other forms of very

238
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,230
high demand content like newly released

239
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:44,279
episodes on Netflix where pre placement

240
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,300
in caches close very close to the edge

241
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:49,900
tremendously ameliorates

242
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:52,750
this this bandwidth unicast bandwidth

243
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,100
need without having to resort to you

244
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,140
know the kind of multicast tricks we use

245
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,790
that are needed for live live content so

246
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,110
that's the second dimensions of the

247
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,310
problem I think it's really useful to

248
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,740
capture somehow you

249
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,930
thank you I was kind of bundling that

250
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,760
under the live verses on demand comment

251
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,099
that I got from Ali last time but I

252
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,810
think that's a helpful refinement thank

253
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:18,550
you Dave blending from over here maybe

254
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,609
even breaking up to two separate charts

255
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,979
one showing sort of the bandwidth

256
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,770
requirements for file based or highly

257
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,900
cacheable content and then a second one

258
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:31,000
that's sort of more live oriented

259
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,970
because then particularly for the live I

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,100
think an additional parameter to try and

261
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,680
start catching is latency as well

262
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,430
because with the because as we evaluate

263
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,199
you know other approaches with highly

264
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,939
cache content latency isn't a big deal

265
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,480
you for watching a movie and it takes

266
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,550
five seconds or 10 or 20 seconds from

267
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,900
initiation to your scene that's fine but

268
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,660
when you're in live content since it

269
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:58,029
tends to be sports oriented latency is

270
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,350
really critical and you can't do 20

271
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,570
seconds you can't do 30 seconds you need

272
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,040
to get like you know 2 to 6 seconds yeah

273
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,700
maybe trying to measure that and the

274
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,530
other aspect doesn't suggest was there's

275
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,050
this other component here which is that

276
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,510
you get the adaptive bit rates coming

277
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,180
into the equation and so I'm not sure

278
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:20,020
how to capture it but I think it's

279
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:23,890
important to recognize that these rates

280
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,329
are variable even during a session and

281
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,069
there's some latter that you and so

282
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,200
maybe it's a it's introduced a

283
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,960
standardized ladder a lot of this

284
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,339
content and then do the charting based

285
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,070
upon those you know because a lot of

286
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,810
typically has these live rates that you

287
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,560
can choose from stared as other sounds

288
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:44,140
that is good for this tact it's a bit

289
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,989
fascinating idea thank you yeah I do

290
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,610
have some text in there about a br that

291
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,500
that speaks a little bit to these points

292
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:55,570
I can't remember off the top of my head

293
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:58,570
not but um yeah that's that's I will

294
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:03,449
overview and and see if that addresses

295
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:06,250
any of your comments thank you okay so

296
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:08,050
I'm hearing engagement at least in this

297
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,720
particular point and it sounds like it

298
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,490
would take a bit of document real estate

299
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,949
to tease apart some of the possible

300
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,870
approaches to answering it so that

301
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:20,380
sounds to me like there is interesting

302
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,579
this document going forward and to your

303
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,559
point about whether or not it's

304
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:28,209
officially a working group document I

305
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:30,190
think I think I don't know if I want to

306
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:35,890
try it hum this early in the morning but

307
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:37,720
um perhaps I should this it is indeed

308
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,400
the document is indeed in kind of a

309
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,990
strange state because it was adopted as

310
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,809
one of the milestones as we went through

311
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,880
the chartering process but on the other

312
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,200
hand we didn't have a formal working

313
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,330
group discussion about whether or not we

314
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,380
wanted to adopt it so I guess at this

315
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:56,350
point I would ask I will ask for a hum

316
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:59,050
are we in favor of adopting Jake's

317
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,520
document and carrying on updates to

318
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,500
carry out this discussion over the next

319
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:06,220
you know month sorry

320
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,140
months 18 months whatever she tried to

321
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,530
tease apart and come up with good

322
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,630
articulations of these things so in

323
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:18,460
favor adopted of adopting the document

324
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,990
please hum now against adopting the

325
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,700
document as a working group document

326
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:29,679
please come now all right thank you all

327
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:32,580
and thank you Jake so so what I heard

328
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,220
was some hums in favor of adopting the

329
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:39,370
document and a very little disagreement

330
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,530
with adopting it as oh yeah yeah sorry

331
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,820
maybe a home for those who how many have

332
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,340
read it

333
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,760
just comment from the Java room you get

334
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,409
three hums in favor okay there's three

335
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:55,500
additional hums in favor thank you great

336
00:18:50,410 --> 00:19:00,040
thank you great anything else

337
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:04,120
seeing Aaron Hawke akamai not speaking

338
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:05,440
for Jabbar but for myself so I confess I

339
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,830
have not read the document but the

340
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:13,059
discussion I thought was a caused me to

341
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:15,309
think that there you know a CDN based

342
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:19,000
media delivery is a pretty mature area

343
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:22,780
there are industry standard key

344
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,960
performance metrics and I think to the

345
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,090
extent that we can avoid reinventing

346
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,500
those in the slightly different way

347
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,550
which will probably cause more confusion

348
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,300
than

349
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:37,330
it solves it's probably a good thing so

350
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:40,180
I think it's probably a good thing to

351
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,189
pull that information into this

352
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:46,270
community since maybe not everybody here

353
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:49,990
is familiar with those but I some of the

354
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:52,300
discussions here seemed like pretty well

355
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,490
trod territory in the in the CDN land

356
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,940
and so let's maybe we can find some

357
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:00,010
citations that are good good sources for

358
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,720
that stuff but it sounds very useful if

359
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,210
you happen to know any such annotations

360
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,070
please send them along I would very much

361
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:10,210
appreciate it they talk to our marketing

362
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:13,240
department let's say let's keep

363
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,830
engineering shall we that's the point

364
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,860
well-taken although I will also observe

365
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,090
that part of the part maybe that's

366
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,800
exactly the right answer and I'm

367
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,929
certainly all for not reinventing

368
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,149
something as well well shaking out

369
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,590
elsewhere as long as at the end of the

370
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,600
day we wind up with something that will

371
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,370
communicate to the IETF community

372
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,419
something about the scale and scope of

373
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,500
you know problems to be addressed yeah

374
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,720
yeah I wasn't trying to imply otherwise

375
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,550
I just think when we're doing something

376
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,900
that if already exists somewhere else we

377
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,909
should probably just suck it in by

378
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,200
boundary I have a comment from the job

379
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,910
room that I wanted to pass on Chris

380
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,440
lemon says he's read the document it's

381
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,530
got room for improvement looks like it's

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,210
going in a direction that will be useful

383
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:56,680
with excellent Chris oh sorry

384
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,870
Scott Davis also said I proved it I am

385
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,600
pretty much aligned with Chris so two

386
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,489
more thumbs up excellent thank you this

387
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,060
is almost Jake are you looking for

388
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,890
co-authors if I have any volunteers for

389
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:13,800
co-authors I would absolutely love to

390
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:15,370
offload some work yeah yes thank you

391
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,830
that would be lovely

392
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:21,550
anybody who you know wants in RFC on the

393
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:24,429
resume this one looks like a good path

394
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:26,800
forward yeah okay great thanks so when I

395
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,120
send to the mailing list that for

396
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,379
confirmation that you know we're

397
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,500
dropping this as a working group

398
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,810
document I will say that you would be

399
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,300
happy to have a co-author yes thank you

400
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,639
good so everybody here can think about

401
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,879
whether or not they want to help and

402
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,710

Thank You Ronnie yes so that it be I

408
00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:04,890
didn't put the URL to our etherpad in my

409
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:09,240
slide deck but it's on the agenda page

410
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:11,490
anyway yeah if if other people are able

411
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,840
to join in on the etherpad and help

412
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:19,860
Ronnie with the notes that would be

413
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:21,330
awesome okay Warren suggests that we

414
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,830
please save the etherpad

415
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:27,480
every now and then in case it

416
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:47,100
accidentally deletes itself okay Sanjay

417
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:49,679
please all right

418
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,178
hello good morning everybody my name is

419
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,460
Sanjay Mishra I wanted Verizon but I'm

420
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:58,950
representing as a member of streaming

421
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:02,370
video Alliance so just giving a quick

422
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:10,260
readout on these tubing video alliances

423
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:13,110
lab initiative okay so the way I want to

424
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,529
run the slides are just to give you a

425
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:19,860
quick word or two on what streaming

426
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:21,360
video Alliance is and the different

427
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,549
working groups within these streaming

428
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:28,500
video Alliance and then kind of jump

429
00:23:23,549 --> 00:23:29,539
into the SVA labs initiative as seen

430
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,090
from one of the working groups

431
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:34,379
implementation of it and then some

432
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:39,689
update on what we have done within the

433
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:42,090
ITF all right so two things here one is

434
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:46,049
that streaming video Alliance is really

435
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:50,220
nothing but an ecosystem of content

436
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:54,029
providers content distributors ISPs and

437
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:57,149
the network technology vendors working

438
00:23:54,029 --> 00:24:00,799
on over-the-top streaming media issues

439
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:03,570
and by and large the Alliance depends on

440
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,899
ITF protocols pretty much for all

441
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:10,850
aspects of streaming but also the fact

442
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:13,199
that the ecosystem provides a way for

443
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:18,090
companies with various degrees of

444
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,549
experience and extra expertise can work

445
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,860
together and work jointly on issues and

446
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:24,539
coming up with best practices or

447
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,559
guidelines or in many cases

448
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:30,509
specifications as well and the next

449
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,610
slide just want to give you a warning

450
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:34,889
there's a lot of words here

451
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:39,678
I guess the objective was to see how

452
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:42,869
many words can fit into a slide well and

453
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,119
so I think that got done but obviously

454
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:47,820
you can't read anything there so there

455
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:51,749
are basically a lot of working groups

456
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,428
within the streaming video Alliance and

457
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:55,590
just to call out just maybe one or two

458
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:58,080
or three of you know what the working

459
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,879
groups are focusing on so let's take an

460
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,949
example of live-streaming working group

461
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:04,799
they focus on issues like quality

462
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:08,159
latency and scalability measurement

463
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,740
group focuses on Keowee networking and

464
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,990
transport working group focuses on

465
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,690
streaming at scale privacy and

466
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:19,110
protection group focuses on piracy and

467
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:22,559
content protection theft user privacy

468
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,939
etc so there are various degrees of work

469
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,379
that goes on within each of these

470
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:31,019
working groups and they end up producing

471
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:34,379
as I said various levels of

472
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:36,149
documentation best practices is one

473
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:37,918
common thing some specifications and

474
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:40,590
also guidelines based on the experience

475
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,590
in the industry and in addition now

476
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,779
through to the IETF mantra of running

477
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:48,809
code Alliance also works on

478
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,850
specifications and api's is actually

479
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:53,519
doing a lot of work now to turn those

480
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:56,908
best practices and in specifications

481
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,139
specifically into api's and they're

482
00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:01,289
doing that by establishing an

483
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:04,918
open-source platform Alliance calls this

484
00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:06,389
and SVA Labs initiative and I think the

485
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,119
following slides gives you a little bit

486
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:11,030
more in-depth view of what that is so if

487
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,030
you look at the SVA lab

488
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:15,860
from these streaming working groups the

489
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:19,700
open caching working groups point of

490
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:22,219
view the open caching is I don't know if

491
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:26,330
it's it's a fancy name but it really is

492
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:28,730
is something same as the concept within

493
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,399
this ad and I where you have an upstream

494
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,530
CDN which can be a commercial CDN or

495
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,400
even a content provider and you have a

496
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:41,629
downstream CDN which can be an ISP so it

497
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:45,200
really is using the CDN IRF sees in

498
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,880
terms of how an upstream CDN can

499
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,590
delegate content down to the downstream

500
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,440
CDN in cases where it decides that

501
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:54,169
that's the best path to do so open

502
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,100
caching is really leveraging CDN IR FCS

503
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,540
and the concept is very very similar and

504
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,459
the you have really three main pieces

505
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,950
within the open caching architecture

506
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,890
what you have is the control function

507
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:09,140
that are within the upstream CDN and you

508
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,720
have the corresponding control functions

509
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,580
within the downstream CDN and then you

510
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,980
have the open caching nodes which are

511
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,790
nothing but really distributed caching

512
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,380
or CDN environment within the downstream

513
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,960
OSI NSR what you see down below there

514
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,080
that are distributed through the network

515
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:30,680
footprint so it distributes the content

516
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,020
easily and the API is basically connects

517
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:35,180
all the dotted lines so what we're doing

518
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:38,690
is that identifying all the key

519
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:40,850
functions laying out the api's and then

520
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,710
we want to open-source those and make

521
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,919
them available for make them available

522
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:48,050
for industry for collaboration in

523
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:51,140
addition to that the working group is

524
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:53,810
also has set up a testbed where we are

525
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,540
testing features such as client

526
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:58,310
stickiness what we have seen is that

527
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,899
some of the media players don't always

528
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:04,520
stick to the last redirected source so

529
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:07,010
the behavior is not very consistent so

530
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:10,220
we've had some conversations previously

531
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:13,070
in IETF on this but I don't think we had

532
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,230
enough data that we could bring back to

533
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,610
pinpoint exactly where the problem is

534
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,770
whether it's the standards or whether

535
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,290
it's just the implementation of those

536
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,910
standards where the inconsistency is so

537
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,350
what we're hoping to do is that run

538
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,450
through our test pad

539
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,959
generate enough data and learn from it

540
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,850
and see if there's any issues that point

541
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,550
towards the standards if so then we can

542
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:40,010
bring it back to the ITF okay and just

543
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:44,210
to kind of give an idea on what really

544
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:48,350
open caching has done so far from these

545
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:50,450
using the CDN our CDN RFC's really there

546
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:54,409
are three or three major areas I would

547
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:55,730
say that we can publish the api's one we

548
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,100
would call as the service provisioning

549
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,720
API is and these would be both

550
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,760
directions coming in from the upstream

551
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,680
CDN to the downstream and also in cases

552
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,040
from and then from downstream CDN

553
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,960
functions down to the ocn footprint and

554
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,980
capacity is usually going up from the

555
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,990
downstream CDN to the upstream CDN

556
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,910
providing the footprint information so

557
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:19,430
that the localization can happen easily

558
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:22,100
and then the content management API is

559
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,260
these focus on coming in from the

560
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,419
upstream CDN to the downstream CDN

561
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,690
specifically for managing the content

562
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:32,420
down to the ocean level we also have

563
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:36,950
api's which we have not standardized

564
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:40,250
them either because companies felt that

565
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,770
some of this was just not quite there

566
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:45,370
yet and in some cases these are very

567
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,720
specific to to features and functions

568
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,719
logging is one such API basically

569
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:53,090
billing and performance related API is

570
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,340
that we have and then the capacity

571
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,860
insight which would be something that

572
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:59,840
the downstream CDN can advertise to the

573
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,860
upstream CDN so that they can figure out

574
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,240
how to allocate content in future so

575
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,229
these are not really the main API is

576
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,940
functions that we have and the intent is

577
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,090
to make these available through the open

578
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:17,030
API but the hope that we will get a

579
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:20,000
wider set of contributors also these

580
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:24,680
would be really restful api x' and we

581
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,210
plan to support in multiple languages so

582
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,210
just to kind of bring all of that

583
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:32,960
together the intent is that I think we

584
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:35,360
have done enough work in terms of

585
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,880
whether technology is and now that we

586
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,129
have the information enough to publish

587
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,130
api's our hope is that this will

588
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:46,550
increase adoption also encourage

589
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:51,280
collaboration from the industry and as

590
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:53,570
we publish these API is one of the core

591
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,780
benefit we also look at is that we can

592
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:59,240
bring back the feedback into the IETF

593
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:01,040
and we have done that based on the open

594
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,740
caching implementation we've got a

595
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:07,490
couple of RFC's there are within this

596
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:09,170
CDN our working group being these are

597
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,310
these have been accepted as the working

598
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:14,420
group documents and they're just

599
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:19,700
progressing through the typical process

600
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:24,110
of working group evaluation I think with

601
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:29,330
that said that's all I have and open for

602
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:32,659
any questions great Thank You Sanjay

603
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,820
um I guess one starting question I have

604
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,290
with regards to you've outlined a lot of

605
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,700
the work that's related to the CD and I

606
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:43,430
work have you provided an update to the

607
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,930
CD and I working group or what's the

608
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:49,270
status err I mean they don't seem to be

609
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:52,700
meeting this week but have you provided

610
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:58,400
in so we're working closely with in the

611
00:31:52,700 --> 00:32:00,320
so the documents that I listed out so

612
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,180
yeah no I I realize that you're working

613
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,439
with the CD and I work what I'm where

614
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,660
I'm trying to get at is that this sort

615
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,380
of provided an overview of how industry

616
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,810
is using the existing standards and it

617
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,670
strikes me that you know that presumably

618
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,710
would be interesting directly to the CD

619
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,910
and I working group or maybe their focus

620
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:18,410
on the work that they're getting done

621
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,650
and don't have time for these industry

622
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,660
updates I mean I'm trying to well its

623
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,840
get a sense of whether or not some of

624
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:30,770
the Kevin MA from one of the co-chairs

625
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,060
has been in the loop on what the SVA is

626
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,680
doing streaming video Alliance is doing

627
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,320
and he's provided some input and

628
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:40,070
guidance as to how we should be looking

629
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,419
at you know coming up with the work so

630
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,490
yeah he's given us some input and

631
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,410
guidance right so I so then I guess my

632
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,770
takeaway is from what you're saying is

633
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:51,740
that this is a useful place a useful

634
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:54,889
venue for IETF in general

635
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:57,110
an update on how the CD ni standards are

636
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,059
being used in industry elsewhere without

637
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:05,050
getting in the way of the actual CD and

638
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:08,030
I work correct okay um so with that i

639
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:09,080
arin Fulk again minor comment could you

640
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,760
take a look at the slide that's on the

641
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,199
screen now

642
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,350
no no just go look at the screen turn

643
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,640
around look up can you see the link no

644
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:20,260
no no they cannot

645
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,940
yeah well this is the supposedly a new

646
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:25,160
fonts that in the color scheme that the

647
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,520
SBA came up with it I really don't like

648
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,350
it

649
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,080
and you just can't really read anything

650
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,360
on it so yes you could send some

651
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,250
feedback in the idea yes I take that

652
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,990
feedback thank you I've already given

653
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,340
this feedback to them but you know

654
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,530
certainly this is helpful yeah I think

655
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,050
you just got 30 more feedbacks so sorry

656
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:46,660
I think we have a clear message for the

657
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:49,309
ITF back to the SVA your template is

658
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,630
those are my words I do have a comment

659
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:52,730
from the jabber room but Chris lemon

660
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,340
says it's been a few meetings since the

661
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:58,809
CBN I met and the CD and I work is

662
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,340
mostly proceeding on the list right

663
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:03,860
which makes sense I just wanted to make

664
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:08,409
sure that you know I don't want mocks to

665
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:14,330
get in the way of other other work okay

666
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:16,159
any other comments or questions all

667
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:18,190
right Thank You Sanjay all right thank

668
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,190
you

669
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:24,129
[Music]

670
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:38,250
hello a so Glenn Dean Comcast NBC

671
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,529
Universal wearing a different hat right

672
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:45,600
now so I was a on the program committee

673
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:49,050
for the recent centi 2019 technical

674
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:51,060
conference it was a very just experience

675
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,280
and what I want to do is provide some

676
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:56,489
feedback or some sharing of things I

677
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,650
observed at that event that I think are

678
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:00,750
relevant to the ITF and hopefully sparks

679
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:04,620
some interests and work here and some

680
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:06,780
lessons so for those who are unfamiliar

681
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,940
with it simply is essentially a

682
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,700
standards body that focuses on what they

683
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,970
call professional content tips typically

684
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,490
came out of the TV world but involves

685
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:19,740
both production a lot of studios that

686
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,330
don't do TV but do movies as well

687
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,970
participate as empty so it's really

688
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,740
professional creation of content

689
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,480
professional distribution of content and

690
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,250
that whole thing one of the things

691
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:34,860
they've been very engaged on for the

692
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:38,190
last few years is a change from an old

693
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,110
transport protocol called SDI which is

694
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,570
what all the equipment in a studio

695
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:45,180
historically was connected with into

696
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:48,870
things our IP base which are very much

697
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:51,660
you seen or using ITF based technologies

698
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,520
and protocols so one of the things I

699
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,859
want to bring back your observations of

700
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,330
where that is right now so that's

701
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,710
clearly still ongoing there's still a

702
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,819
lot of studios out there with umbrellas

703
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:04,170
they got a replace a lot of equipment

704
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,450
that are still migrating to 2110 and and

705
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,010
going on to the IP networks but a couple

706
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,750
things that really came out of the the

707
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,190
conference that people were found

708
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,890
interesting to talk about and really

709
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:17,310
engage on microphones where the

710
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,440
challenges of building IP networks for

711
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:23,640
media there are several people that gave

712
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,430
talks on network architectures that were

713
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,460
designed entirely to allow for extremely

714
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:31,020
high bandwidth low latency connections

715
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,110
between editing stations that you mean

716
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:37,230
Bay's cameras and recording devices and

717
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,700
storage bays and clouds it was you know

718
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,200
a few of the things as a different guy

719
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,850
made me cringe when I saw them because

720
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,480
you know some people said well you don't

721
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,940
want to build love

722
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,350
multi-tiered hierarchical networks in

723
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,660
your shop you want to build one big

724
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,759
giant flat network where everybody's on

725
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:55,080
the same segment so you can get high

726
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:58,170
bandwidth it made me cringe roll into

727
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,970
the ITF there may be some guidance work

728
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:02,430
that we might want to draft some

729
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,959
materials on for best practices of how

730
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,950
to build such networks and I realize

731
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,660
that crosses a little bit in the

732
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:08,250
operation thing we have expertise

733
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,460
service so for future working this group

734
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:14,550
that might be an area we want to sort of

735
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:16,410
tap into and play with the second one

736
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,630
was something which kind of surprised me

737
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:21,060
even though I I do live in this world I

738
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:23,130
didn't realize how much focused people

739
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,190
really had on time still yeah there is

740
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:28,620
numerous papers that talked about time

741
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:31,580
and this has been brought on because the

742
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,710
old protocols did carry time information

743
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:37,830
around with them and all the devices and

744
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:40,500
were able to synchronize and be you know

745
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,150
engaged and synchronizing their actions

746
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,710
but also when they blend content

747
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,080
together in pieces that all worked

748
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,310
really well under IPE they lost that and

749
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,960
so one of the things they've been trying

750
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:52,590
to figure out 2110 dear daddy and

751
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,320
mechanisms for sharing time but the time

752
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,890
sources are then becoming a problem and

753
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:01,830
so you know it's a complex environment

754
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:04,710
they heavily have doors PTP

755
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:07,560
which is a time standard of course if

756
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,300
you if you're familiar with it there is

757
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,310
other mechanisms though they didn't lock

758
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,320
into only p2p there's other ones they

759
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,400
are proposing discussing because they

760
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,980
have a lot of scenarios where they're

761
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,240
offline or they one of the scenarios

762
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,690
that was brought up was if you're trying

763
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,970
to source from GPS information and your

764
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:26,010
GPS is all go down or your antennas are

765
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,359
covered in snow you have a bit of a

766
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,620
problem how do you deal with that it's

767
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,290
some new work that they were trying to

768
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:32,640
get other parties to take up so likewise

769
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,070
there may be work here the ITF or you

770
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,440
may want to take up around time again I

771
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:39,660
time is time time is coming in for time

772
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,600
it's a question in the middle before I

773
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,670
go on the next point or on even I heard

774
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,799
I had similar question because people

775
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:48,990
that were trying to transport the it

776
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,370
depends how you transport the media and

777
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:53,430
they were trying to transport the media

778
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:55,109
using RTP but use the GPS times them how

779
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,470
to synchronize between the g3 at times

780
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,440
then

781
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:00,359
how to convey in in RTP because the

782
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,050
precision is different of the of the

783
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,299
information so right so I think it's

784
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:09,000
important because I mean again it would

785
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,460
be good also for us to know what how do

786
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,500
cups how the data is how's the medians

787
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:16,109
transported in order to figure out what

788
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,720
we can do also here in other working

789
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:20,400
group in order to to help with with this

790
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,140
timing it's what was mostly because

791
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,940
there was sending the information from

792
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,279
different sources and they want to to

793
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,720
combine them when in the the production

794
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,640
area and that's where the timing and

795
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,759
they were getting from the camera the

796
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:34,589
GPS time was that yes and and a tad on

797
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,319
that one of the concerns that many

798
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:40,560
people started raising was worries over

799
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:41,609
security in integrity of time because if

800
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,220
you imagine a lot of stuff that's

801
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:47,220
getting you know produced and streamed

802
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,868
out live if you start tinkering with the

803
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,328
time you can cause a lot of problems

804
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:53,520
make screens go dark and cost people a

805
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:56,490
lot of money or if you wanna be really

806
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,810
nefarious you know makes the time go bad

807
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,759
and then start inserting your own

808
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:02,220
material that's out of sync with it

809
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,130
cause a lot of sort of social activism

810
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,770
if you will Aaron I comment from the

811
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,930
jabber room Scott Davis says time is

812
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,400
everything in production there are fine

813
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,919
grained time mechanisms and legacy

814
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,430
productions that is critical to make the

815
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,849
processes work I think he's agreeing

816
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,799
with you

817
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,329
do you have more I have a comment but I

818
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,520
can wait to you know I this is my one

819
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:26,220
slide I I have one final point on this

820
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,680
one slide and then go ahead make it okay

821
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,209
the one thing I got really excited about

822
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,190
when I was sitting in this conference

823
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,140
was the number people started benching

824
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:35,069
ipv6

825
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,660
historically the the you know

826
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:40,319
professional media industry has not been

827
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:43,440
a big supporter of v6 and I people

828
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,329
started talking about v6 was like yes so

829
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,119
I just wanted to bring that back to the

830
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:49,800
ITF they're starting to listen to us and

831
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,720
they're getting on board which is

832
00:40:49,800 --> 00:41:02,369
awesome that's great so Aaron Faulk

833
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:04,290
Akamai I this is the time well see there

834
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:05,760
was another presentation that's actually

835
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:08,200
in a few different forms this week on

836
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,430
the itu-t

837
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:14,379
t30 vision of you know IP of the future

838
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,440
first I want to say it looks like SEM T

839
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,270
has beaten them by looking at 2110 so

840
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,440
that's great that you know sort of

841
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,500
getting a little further into the future

842
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,049
but at a more serious note time actually

843
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:32,890
appears on their list and one of the

844
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:34,509
things that sort of left me unsatisfied

845
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,549
about the discussion there was it was

846
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:40,150
more sort of a statement of we need

847
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:42,250
better precision and here what this what

848
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:44,230
I'm hearing here is that we're actually

849
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,599
running better precision in lots of

850
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:48,670
different ways and and so the question

851
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:49,960
that I have is what exactly are the

852
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,400
problems and challenges that are coming

853
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,140
out of this I think it would be actually

854
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,020
really useful information for the IDF to

855
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,848
understand like what are the limitations

856
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,380
where are things not working so that we

857
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:02,920
can actually talk about some potential

858
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,150
work here I you know this is one slide

859
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,470
with a few bullets so it's very high

860
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:14,920
level but I think that this is a very

861
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:16,118
valid activity for this working group is

862
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,829
to try to bring in some of these

863
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:19,150
challenges from operational areas on

864
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:20,650
like where the protocols we're hitting

865
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:22,450
some walls and what they can do where

866
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,680
there's too many solutions or like the

867
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,299
stuff that Roni was just measuring

868
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,640
mentioning and so I think if we could

869
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:29,589
get some drafts on like you know hey

870
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,299
here's an industry situation where you

871
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,770
know this is painful that would be

872
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:34,150
really helpful for the IETF to say oh

873
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,710
well here's an area or maybe we should

874
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,960
apply some engineering I agree with you

875
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,940
I fully agree that I think specifically

876
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,230
are on time capturing some of their use

877
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,790
cases they're thinking through them

878
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,700
let's capture him bring them over in

879
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:50,520
here and get to work on it I never ran

880
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:52,689
again so on the issue of time

881
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,890
historically the media industry in the

882
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,329
networking industry have lived in

883
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:57,069
completely separate bubbles and we're

884
00:42:55,329 --> 00:43:00,190
seeing sort of the consequences of those

885
00:42:57,069 --> 00:43:03,670
bubbles evolving in parallel but but

886
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,170
that may be entirely irrelevant because

887
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,059
the cloud data center people have

888
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:08,790
created a third bubble which is probably

889
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:11,349
going to blow both of these bubbles away

890
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:13,839
because they met because most the data

891
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:16,240
center operators now have a sub

892
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,520
nanosecond atomic clock synchronization

893
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,279
across their entire data centers and

894
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,540
they don't do it with

895
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,120
either of the things we're talking about

896
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:27,060
here so it'd be really useful to spin

897
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,440
them into this conversation because if

898
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,970
you're gonna run in one of those data

899
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,920
centers your problem basically

900
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:34,230
evaporates because you have nanosecond

901
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,390
scale time synchronization across the

902
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,590
entire data center melting point that's

903
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,009
your point Dave I had not considered

904
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:42,900
that so if you're only worried about

905
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,490
distribution you're right

906
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,860
the these groups are also worried about

907
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:49,490
video production and video productions

908
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:53,850
running in the in data centers file

909
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:55,439
infrastructures okay so all right what

910
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:57,750
top point is look at what these guys are

911
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,490
doing because we can put Tomic clocks

912
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:03,900
almost anywhere now

913
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:05,819
at reasonable cost well and you know

914
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,710
there isn't going to be one single way

915
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,930
people do this it's a very diverse set

916
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,400
of environments it ranges from people

917
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,640
doing field production in the jungle

918
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:17,210
recording a movie to people connected to

919
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,830
live networks to people in stadiums

920
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,410
doing live streaming at low latency so

921
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:24,840
there there's a lot of areas here to get

922
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,120
really into different nets and different

923
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,240
details all I'm saying is that the way

924
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,250
the technology is going it is reasonable

925
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,770
to assume you can afford an atomic clock

926
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:40,800
most places but can you carry them on an

927
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:42,570
airplane can you can your plane yes so

928
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,870
go through Thoreau through TSA awesome

929
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,700
yes you may need to have a refrigerator

930
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:55,100
in order to keep the temperature stable

931
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:58,200
though so going back to Jake's document

932
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:00,270
I again I haven't looked at it but does

933
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,529
the taxonomy that he's looking at it's

934
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,759
mostly on is it mostly on the

935
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,950
distribution side results on the

936
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,500
production side it was primarily on the

937
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:11,220
edge side rather than that just in the

938
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,590
center so I think that there's yeah so I

939
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,839
think that the focus that I think it

940
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:17,940
needs to have is is is more on the you

941
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,820
know do we have the capacity or looking

942
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:22,500
at the capacity gap okay well I think

943
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,820
that Glenn's raising a different set of

944
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,740
questions on the production side and so

945
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,390
maybe a taxonomy document to help inform

946
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,819
the IETF on like what do these

947
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:31,529
environments really look at this is kind

948
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,270
of like what TCP Sat did in the early

949
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,050
days was to try to pull in some

950
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,850
information on

951
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:37,920
like you know what our that what's the

952
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,870
variation in in these environments to

953
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,930
understand what I mean from a networking

954
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:45,660
point of view okay so maybe we can look

955
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,339
forward to causing a draft to appear and

956
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,839
then next time we can discuss whether or

957
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:53,370
not it's something we need to adopt good

958
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,810
thanks thank you good I got another

959
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,920
comment from javi that's what happens

960
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,810
when I talk too much

961
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,630
Mike English says even distribution

962
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:02,279
spans data centers and networks time

963
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:11,430
synchronization is still concerned in

964
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:15,060
heterogeneous environments yeah all

965
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:26,700
right switching gears Igor you're in the

966
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:30,450
room here we are I'm Eva little bit of

967
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,970
Akamai and my goal today is basically to

968
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:35,970
bring some information to the people who

969
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:39,120
were not who are not following a working

970
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:42,899
group every moment and to share some of

971
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:46,650
the observations about what quick will

972
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:48,300
bring to the people who operate media

973
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:50,490
streaming who are responsible for

974
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:56,240
quality of service what kind of changes

975
00:46:50,490 --> 00:47:00,660
some challenges that you'll encounter

976
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:04,529
alright so I I'm probably preaching to

977
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:06,690
the choir when they say that monitoring

978
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,120
and troubleshooting network is important

979
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:14,910
for quality of service at least to this

980
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:17,640
group but it's basically that's what

981
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:21,470
operators life to do on the network is

982
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,940
to be able to see delay and loss and

983
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:26,100
hopefully see it before their customers

984
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,790
call them and tell them about the

985
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:33,150
problem that they're facing when you are

986
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:34,800
looking at TCP streams people have been

987
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:37,020
traditionally linear the sequence

988
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,660
numbers and if a symmetric if a path is

989
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,810
symmetric X numbers and you could put

990
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:46,049
together estimate of the loss and the

991
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:48,670
estimate of the delay are quick as

992
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:50,829
people are aware

993
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,289
it's a protocol that encrypting his

994
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:58,920
headers it's doing it for some very good

995
00:47:53,289 --> 00:48:02,369
reasons including security user privacy

996
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:05,499
especially in the world of migrating

997
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:09,579
user age users who come from one network

998
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:12,368
to another and for protocol ossification

999
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:15,160
reasons which is basically trying to get

1000
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:17,079
the middle boxes to keep the hands away

1001
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:21,308
from parts of the protocol that they

1002
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:23,369
shouldn't be looking at and now so one

1003
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:28,390
of the goals of quic is to be able to

1004
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:30,190
evolve the protocol quickly now one of

1005
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:32,469
the alternatives is well if you cannot

1006
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:34,900
see anything in quit there is no signal

1007
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:38,229
in it let's just observe similar TCP

1008
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:42,579
flows that actually worked pretty well

1009
00:48:38,229 --> 00:48:46,710
today because a quick on the internet

1010
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:49,599
represents single digit of traffic I

1011
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:54,190
totally expect that once good working

1012
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:56,079
group publishes a spec and there is a

1013
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,660
number of implementations every single

1014
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:01,150
browser has one and every city and will

1015
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:03,729
have an implementation there will be a

1016
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:05,680
step function in the amount of quick

1017
00:49:03,729 --> 00:49:09,430
track percentage of traffic on the

1018
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:14,348
internet so we'll need to develop more

1019
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:16,739
viable more viable tools and Spencer cut

1020
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:16,739
equation

1021
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:23,920
Spencer Dawkins two things I wanted to

1022
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:28,420
mention thank you for bringing this work

1023
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:31,029
here Igor I could be wrong about this

1024
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:35,890
but to the best of my knowledge this is

1025
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:38,890
the first time a chartered ops working

1026
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,440
group has talked about this issue and I

1027
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,910
think it's been really important

1028
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:48,219
speaking is the former area director of

1029
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:51,160
the spin bit yeah you love jumping ahead

1030
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:54,039
to my love flight but but yeah that's I

1031
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:57,640
completely agree with you yes excellent

1032
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:00,999
on this on this slide when you say just

1033
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,470
observe similar TCP flows is not a good

1034
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:04,930
answer

1035
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:06,308
how bad is it and you don't you don't

1036
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,200
have to answer but I'm saying I think

1037
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:10,930
that's the engineering question right

1038
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:13,029
that's gonna really matter it's always

1039
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,069
is this as this conversation goes so I

1040
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:18,910
love it to have actually extra time here

1041
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:22,839
and I'm happy to answer this this

1042
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:28,750
question so how bad is it I don't know

1043
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:32,259
whether it's really bad today but the

1044
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:34,569
TCP and UDP have very different treat

1045
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:38,200
gets very different treatment but by the

1046
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:41,470
network it's actually not uncommon to

1047
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:44,770
have a network under a large UDP flood

1048
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:46,750
and that typically I would assume

1049
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:49,710
because it's much easier to compromise

1050
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:50,829
the user space application and send

1051
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:54,130
spoofed

1052
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:59,079
UDP traffic and typically it networks

1053
00:50:54,130 --> 00:51:02,290
what they do is a police rate limit on

1054
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:03,700
the UDP and their links so you may

1055
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,250
immediately get very different

1056
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,710
performance from UDP application and

1057
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:13,020
from a TCP application so absorbing TCP

1058
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:15,700
and UDP may actually diverge quite a bit

1059
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:17,740
Bernard about Microsoft just wanted to

1060
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:21,339
make a comment that I think this may be

1061
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:24,308
assuming that quic is used in some of

1062
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:27,369
the same manners that TCP is but what

1063
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:29,470
I'm saying is is somewhat different

1064
00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:31,990
streaming architectures being used with

1065
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:33,879
quick such as things like scalable video

1066
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:36,520
coding and one of the problems that

1067
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:39,040
introduced is introduces is that it's no

1068
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:42,160
longer sufficient to just know aggregate

1069
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,720
loss you really want to know the loss of

1070
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,970
each of the layers that are being

1071
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,000
transmitted and that's something you can

1072
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:51,399
really only get from the end systems

1073
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,549
it's not really easy to observe that in

1074
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,069
in transit even if you have even if you

1075
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:59,130
were to do everything in the clear you'd

1076
00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:02,349
have to have the right RTP markings and

1077
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:04,960
observing all that is kind of complex so

1078
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:06,910
and I would observe that we've created a

1079
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:09,220
whole bunch of new metrics on the sender

1080
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:11,950
and receive side that actually get you

1081
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,750
much more detailed loss data than you

1082
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,160
could possibly get through network

1083
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,830
observation so

1084
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:19,450
just something to think about that this

1085
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,910
stuff isn't necessarily going to be

1086
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:23,680
collected the way it used to be that it

1087
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:26,589
may be collected at the a player not

1088
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:29,169
even anything at the end points right I

1089
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:31,360
mean definitely you cannot get

1090
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:34,090
everything you possibly want just by

1091
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,700
observing transport I mean that's that's

1092
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:41,860
the same thing in TCP world and UDP

1093
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:46,600
world absolutely true all right so just

1094
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:48,700
a little bit of about well media

1095
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,279
streaming right now is by far the

1096
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,930
biggest quick use case so that's why

1097
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,920
it's but it's important for this group

1098
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:59,980
and the streaming is actually very

1099
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:07,330
sensitive to changes in round-trip time

1100
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:11,770
and the packet loss now so what is

1101
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:15,009
available once quick basically removes

1102
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:18,220
all the implicit signals from the

1103
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:22,390
transport layer the world there was work

1104
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:25,629
on putting back an explicit signal for

1105
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:28,359
delay measurement it's a spin bit it is

1106
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:30,910
available it's in quick version one I

1107
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:33,850
mean of course it's subject to user

1108
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:36,759
agents actually supporting turning it on

1109
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:39,490
but it is part of the standard and it

1110
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:43,030
works in a pretty simple way you just

1111
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:46,209
have a server that echoing back those

1112
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:50,230
bits as it received from the last packet

1113
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:51,850
from the client and clients spinning the

1114
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,430
bit basically it's flipping it to

1115
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:57,190
another opposite value from the last

1116
00:53:54,430 --> 00:54:00,250
packet that they received from the

1117
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:03,760
server and you could see an unpaired

1118
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:07,510
observer can measure round-trip time in

1119
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,370
each direction so you you can you can be

1120
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,810
on each either of the directions and you

1121
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:15,400
could measure the round-trip time of

1122
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:19,060
connections it's using one of the bits

1123
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:21,850
that were previously resolved now it's

1124
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,279
dedicated for spin bit in quick short

1125
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:27,490
header so it's basically in the first

1126
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:30,049
byte and there is a link to some more

1127
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:34,468
about it

1128
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:38,989
lost bits so the loss loss trip signal

1129
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:45,239
is not going to be in quit version one

1130
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:48,809
that mostly due to timing but there are

1131
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:53,190
proposals to how to do the loss

1132
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:55,349
measurement and there is a quick

1133
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:57,839
extension draft or maybe there will be

1134
00:54:55,349 --> 00:55:00,239
several that are actively in the works

1135
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:05,279
and will do very soon one of them from

1136
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:07,739
us mechanisms how to add loss reporting

1137
00:55:05,279 --> 00:55:11,609
and the loss reporting is goal is to be

1138
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:15,599
able to first of all observe that there

1139
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:18,150
is loss quantify how much and to be able

1140
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,999
to decide to determine whether its

1141
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:22,529
upstream loss or downstream loss which

1142
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:27,259
is very important when you try to

1143
00:55:22,529 --> 00:55:31,349
actually troubleshoot the source of it

1144
00:55:27,259 --> 00:55:33,599
like with a spin bit it's good it would

1145
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:35,989
be using a reserve of bits that are

1146
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:40,529
available include version 1 header and

1147
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:44,729
right now there are two drafts available

1148
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:48,299
for slightly different but somewhat

1149
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:51,899
similar methods of measuring loss they

1150
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:57,150
all just drafts on principle of

1151
00:55:51,900 --> 00:56:00,329
operation so actually since again we

1152
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:03,209
have probably a couple minutes I don't

1153
00:56:00,329 --> 00:56:05,549
have a slide here you could read the

1154
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:09,660
draft or look at the more extensive

1155
00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:13,319
presentation in Montreal and TSE WG but

1156
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:15,359
so one of the operational principles for

1157
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:18,319
one of the proposals is essentially you

1158
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:22,619
have a square wave so if you have a

1159
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:25,319
marking that alternates every n packets

1160
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:27,809
and by absorbing that you could observe

1161
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:31,709
the upstream loss and then you have a

1162
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:34,489
another bit that's effectively driven by

1163
00:56:31,709 --> 00:56:37,859
the protocols loss detection machinery

1164
00:56:34,489 --> 00:56:40,109
if a loss is over packet is detected it

1165
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:41,950
increments the counter and if it sends

1166
00:56:40,109 --> 00:56:44,380
out a packet it marks is

1167
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:47,439
counter is nonzero and decrement the

1168
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:50,740
counter so basically from that

1169
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,460
information you can determine and to end

1170
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:55,750
lost which is because it's what our

1171
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,820
protocol machinery determines now

1172
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,950
knowing end to end loss and upstream

1173
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:03,390
loss you can figure out everything else

1174
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:07,720
so that's basically our proposals

1175
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:14,980
mechanisms around others and just before

1176
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:17,919
we close it's kind of a for completeness

1177
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:22,480
some people said well one way to

1178
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:25,359
determine loss in quit is to decrypt all

1179
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:29,260
those headers so here the encryption key

1180
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:31,569
is with some trusted middle box and now

1181
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:33,460
you don't have a problem there are lots

1182
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:35,770
of problems with that from security

1183
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,109
prosperity from privacy perspective but

1184
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:41,470
it's actually even from implementation

1185
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:45,819
perspective decrypting a whole ton of

1186
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:49,720
connections real time is hard key

1187
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:54,609
distribution under lossy conditions is

1188
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:57,459
hard and problematic and just not a good

1189
00:57:54,609 --> 00:58:00,009
idea so basically we have to have an

1190
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:06,150
explicit signal in the protocol to

1191
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:09,490
enable this kind of measurement and so

1192
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:11,230
what do we want for the operators for

1193
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,569
people who actually care about this for

1194
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:17,140
people who think it's an absorbing loss

1195
00:58:13,569 --> 00:58:20,800
as important to do number one thing is

1196
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:23,020
if you have a discussion happening

1197
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:26,230
around you just pick up and say it's

1198
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:29,050
important that probably one of the main

1199
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:31,060
reasons as Spencer said that we're still

1200
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:33,940
here talking about experiments as

1201
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:35,799
opposed to another proposal already in

1202
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:38,650
version one is that we haven't had a

1203
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:43,150
huge operator presence in quit working

1204
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:45,910
group from the beginning and so we're

1205
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:50,859
here now and of course watch folk with a

1206
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:53,379
quick extension draft that's and then

1207
00:58:50,859 --> 00:58:54,870
there are a number of links for people

1208
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:57,450
who are interested in

1209
00:58:54,870 --> 00:59:03,620
learning a lot more about everything to

1210
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:07,879
talk about thank you thank you questions

1211
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:10,319
yeah mr. Dawkins : and I have finally

1212
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:13,950
used the spin bit to figure out who was

1213
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:16,590
going to speak first so thank you oh I

1214
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:18,839
say thank you for bringing this to the

1215
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:20,370
to the working groups to the working

1216
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:27,230
groups attention I love being able to

1217
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:29,940
say that about ops it if I understood

1218
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:34,710
your point about about explicit

1219
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:37,410
signaling your talk is were you talking

1220
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:39,420
about involving the endpoints that in

1221
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:41,879
that or did you mean something else

1222
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:45,330
yes explicit signaling means that the

1223
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:49,020
sender of a packet put some signal that

1224
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:51,990
explicitly meant for the pass for a

1225
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,910
particular specific purpose as opposed

1226
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:56,270
to what we have with many other

1227
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:59,129
protocols TCP is a great example where

1228
00:59:56,270 --> 01:00:01,920
there are protocol machine there's

1229
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:10,680
protocol machineries that observers try

1230
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:12,030
to lachan and infer information so I'm

1231
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,270
sure this happened many times before

1232
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:20,640
this but the one I'm remembering is the

1233
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:23,480
manu ib workshop in 2015 where we were

1234
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:26,520
basically saying how will how will

1235
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,740
network operators understand what's

1236
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:32,600
happening to their networks same problem

1237
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:34,799
here just different different operators

1238
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,770
which is which sounds like a good thing

1239
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:40,170
I've never understood how we were going

1240
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:44,040
to be able to do this without involving

1241
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:48,830
the without involving the endpoints and

1242
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:53,220
especially the interaction between

1243
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:55,140
what's in the quick invariants so that

1244
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:57,720
basically you could have network

1245
01:00:55,140 --> 01:01:01,859
operations network operators that could

1246
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:07,470
consistently look at what they need

1247
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:08,330
across versions of quick vs. being able

1248
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:10,220
to ever change

1249
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:14,180
anything because the point was that the

1250
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:15,859
very invariants aren't don't vary so I

1251
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,359
think that I think that like I say I

1252
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:22,130
think that you're definitely headed in

1253
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:23,930
the right direction and I only wish we'd

1254
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:25,700
been smart enough to do that a couple of

1255
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,410
years ago because I think you're

1256
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:30,319
definitely headed in the right direction

1257
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:32,620
thank you I think so as far as

1258
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:36,080
invariants that is a great question

1259
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:37,940
quick is a pretty new thing that people

1260
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,200
have not had much experience with

1261
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,970
anything like it

1262
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,629
especially on anything like this scale

1263
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:47,839
so the signals we're talking about are

1264
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:50,720
also quite new that many people nobody

1265
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:53,420
really nobody has any experience at

1266
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,120
scale so all of these things are quite

1267
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,940
experimental and so forth that's why

1268
01:01:56,120 --> 01:02:02,330
it's their involvement one I can totally

1269
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:05,270
see if they take off as one of the

1270
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:07,460
important means for people to monitor

1271
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:09,620
their network then they're going to be

1272
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:12,410
deemed very very useful and nobody will

1273
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:14,569
think of removing them from the future

1274
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:20,350
were kind of the protocol if there are

1275
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:24,020
no problems with them hi Colin Perkins

1276
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:26,960
so gory Fairhurst and I have a draft in

1277
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:29,240
the transport working group which is

1278
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:33,440
talking about the effects of transfer

1279
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:35,930
header encryption on future transport

1280
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,490
Briscoe V pollution now one of the

1281
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:39,440
things that talks about is the

1282
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:42,620
implicates the implications for network

1283
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:48,170
operations and management it's in last

1284
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:49,370
call in the TSV WG it received a a fair

1285
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:52,240
amount it received a fair amount of

1286
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:56,120
feedback primarily from the security

1287
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:57,859
related people it would be useful I

1288
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,600
think if this community could also have

1289
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:05,000
looked at it and see if it makes sense

1290
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:08,839
and if people have concerns or comments

1291
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,460
about what we're saying draft ia TFTs

1292
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:15,190
vwg transport encrypt I believe yes

1293
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:18,860
definitely it's a if the draft that

1294
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:21,770
inspired some of the work that we're

1295
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:26,170
doing and this is actually put in bits

1296
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:31,119
and the wire that work with more general

1297
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:34,369
observation about effect of indifferent

1298
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:36,500
James bruising BBC I'm not the most

1299
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:38,630
knowledgeable and quick so if I get this

1300
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:41,780
wrong somebody stop me

1301
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:44,030
so one crazy idea is is instead of

1302
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:47,300
having quick doing affirmative a Khan

1303
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:49,369
port Rangers switching it so we're doing

1304
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:52,880
negative AK which is what a lot of Arc

1305
01:03:49,369 --> 01:03:54,980
based protocols use and then use one of

1306
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,349
those reserve bits for the signaling

1307
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:59,660
this would be in the client opts into

1308
01:03:57,349 --> 01:04:03,560
telling when there's loss in the network

1309
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:06,410
but the details of how much needs to be

1310
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:10,190
retransmitted is still inside of the

1311
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:13,670
encrypted payload I'm happy to talk to

1312
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:18,140
you offline and to get the figure out

1313
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:21,109
the details the general just about just

1314
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:23,779
the overall quick is that it's trying to

1315
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:29,210
make sure that the only signals we put

1316
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:31,070
here are truly explicit signals about

1317
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:34,000
this particular purpose so if we try to

1318
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:38,000
marry a little bit of protocol machinery

1319
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:41,359
to be in the clear it may be different

1320
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:47,210
it may become difficult but I'm happy to

1321
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:49,009
talk to you hi core sanjay mishra from

1322
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:51,830
verizon so i think this is really good

1323
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:55,310
and I was at a quick meeting where the

1324
01:04:51,830 --> 01:04:57,140
discussion did happen on this and I know

1325
01:04:55,310 --> 01:05:00,049
a lot of operators didn't necessarily

1326
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:04,609
stood up to the mic to to support it but

1327
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:05,990
I think it's implicitly there and you

1328
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:08,240
know I think this there's a lot of

1329
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:10,180
exhaustion also on on the operators is

1330
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:12,200
part because they've stood up

1331
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:16,160
significantly and Mark can vouch for

1332
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:18,710
that just to get spin bit in the in

1333
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:21,009
quick so I think it's not it's it's not

1334
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:25,160
lack of interest in this there's a

1335
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:27,290
tremendous interest and certainly I

1336
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,990
think you the point you made it's well

1337
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:31,460
taken and you know I speak for Verizon

1338
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:33,759
but I think other operators are also

1339
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,530
very equally interested in

1340
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,850
in having in seeing this work progress

1341
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:38,890
so I think we'll we'll keep an eye on

1342
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,060
that and in provide comments and things

1343
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:47,529
as needed

1344
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:50,500
thank you thanks ahead I'd like to take

1345
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:52,060
the comment if it up liver so I have

1346
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:55,450
heard like Bernie talking about like a

1347
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:57,190
lot of like lost information and other

1348
01:05:55,450 --> 01:06:00,310
information metrics will be collected in

1349
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:01,450
the in points and also here like Spencer

1350
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:03,970
saying like yeah

1351
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:08,700
how do you do without involving end

1352
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:11,379
points right so I so would it be so

1353
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:14,439
would it be very unrealistic to think

1354
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:17,080
like in the future that we have more a

1355
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,840
collaborative client and network in

1356
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:22,660
place where basically client is helping

1357
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:25,870
and the network with providing some

1358
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:28,149
information about these kind of metrics

1359
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:29,830
they think like well I'm suffering so

1360
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:32,320
maybe there is something that I cannot

1361
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:33,940
do on the server maybe something I share

1362
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,940
with the network so network fix itself

1363
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:41,440
something like that and on that note

1364
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:44,020
there also initiative being here it's

1365
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,390
coming initiative and unlike mask where

1366
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,580
you actually put some explicit proxy for

1367
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:50,319
quick traffic and stuff like that where

1368
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,330
you can have some kind of explicit

1369
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,520
channel which is basically authenticated

1370
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:59,290
and agreed on where you share some

1371
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:01,330
information and I think that that is

1372
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:04,000
another another thing that we might want

1373
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:06,250
to look at or more explicit more like a

1374
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,430
collaborative way of solving the problem

1375
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:12,640
you start up and doing everyone does

1376
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:14,740
this best and nothing at it so that's

1377
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,890
that would be one way of looking at the

1378
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:19,779
problems yes yeah I totally say that

1379
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:23,020
people will come up with very

1380
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:25,360
interesting ways of solving problems and

1381
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:30,910
people are pretty creative around here

1382
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:33,640
and if you find clients and that willing

1383
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:36,819
to talk to cooperating cooperating

1384
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:39,460
middle box and through some control

1385
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:43,420
plain communications happening that's

1386
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:45,150
helping performance or anything else it

1387
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:48,780
will happen if it's useful and if

1388
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:48,780
clients find it useful

1389
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:57,780
hello there I am Emil second for more

1390
01:07:54,070 --> 01:08:04,150
lunch and so we go we asked this slot

1391
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:06,160
because network operation on monitoring

1392
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:09,930
is based on the observation of the delay

1393
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:12,850
on the packet loss and we have been a

1394
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:16,960
safe fighting in the quick working group

1395
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:20,890
to get the spin bit so to observe the

1396
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:24,720
delay so on so with the spin bit a non

1397
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:27,460
pass device can observe there's a

1398
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:30,310
decomposition of the delay let's say on

1399
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:34,299
the right on the left on nowhere is the

1400
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:36,010
big bitter and so we are now asking to

1401
01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:38,620
get the same thing for packet last

1402
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:44,380
observation on were close to good

1403
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:46,450
something and that is I suppose is going

1404
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:49,990
to be useful for media distribution

1405
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:52,750
right so I mean I wouldn't call it

1406
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:56,229
fighting but there is definitely working

1407
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:58,510
group with a collection of very spirited

1408
01:08:56,229 --> 01:09:02,620
high spirited an opinion appear native

1409
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:08,100
people so it's fun but good things

1410
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:11,019
happen definitely and yes so like I said

1411
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:13,750
there is an extension draft that's going

1412
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:16,750
to be prepared we'll try to get it in

1413
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:19,630
time for the quick interim will

1414
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:22,149
definitely post it on the list and were

1415
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:22,750
more than welcome actually very very

1416
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:24,729
welcome

1417
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:26,920
a feedback from the community feedback

1418
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:30,059
and the technical staff feedback on the

1419
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:33,130
privacy implications or whatever people

1420
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:36,970
find that they really want to contribute

1421
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:40,420
about motorcoach video from Telecom

1422
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:43,450
Italia with operators we are very

1423
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:46,210
interested in this technology we have

1424
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:49,510
the developer of the other alternative

1425
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:51,779
methodology but we support this kind of

1426
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:54,850
measurement because in our opinion

1427
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:57,820
packet loss and delay in a species way

1428
01:09:54,850 --> 01:10:00,190
is very important to monitor our network

1429
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,360
is not also important to motor the

1430
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:03,309
application by

1431
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,639
is also important to motile the network

1432
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:10,270
in particular to segment the network in

1433
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:14,140
the many segments each segment each

1434
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:16,720
segment is the domain of each operator

1435
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:18,460
so we want to distinguish the

1436
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,710
measurement to the segment the network

1437
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:23,020
to understand where is the problem

1438
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:24,640
so this kind list of measurement in a

1439
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:27,400
species way is very important in

1440
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:30,490
encrypted protocol this is our opinion

1441
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:32,170
so we support very much this kind of

1442
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:33,639
measurement thank you yeah that's a

1443
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:35,410
common feedback that essentially what

1444
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:38,410
operators want is they want to be able

1445
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:40,389
to if there is loss for example figure

1446
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:47,200
out where it's coming from and to just

1447
01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:49,690
know whom to call Spencer Dawkins I I

1448
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:51,790
did not get up here to say this but I

1449
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:53,679
can definitely can confirm that there

1450
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:56,410
was fighting in the quick working group

1451
01:10:53,680 --> 01:11:00,910
about the spin but but more relevant

1452
01:10:56,410 --> 01:11:05,620
probably to this discussion is the plus

1453
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:10,990
buff that we had in Berlin that was a

1454
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:13,780
tussle of amazing proportions to the

1455
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:16,440
point where you know I made the decision

1456
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:19,990
not to charter a working group there

1457
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:23,469
which was intended to provide visibility

1458
01:11:19,990 --> 01:11:25,599
to on path observers so I mean it's like

1459
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:27,820
you know couldn't even shorter at the

1460
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:31,210
work so that the part where you're

1461
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:34,690
talking about on about involving the end

1462
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:36,250
points with explicit signaling and is

1463
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:39,669
you know instead of district

1464
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:42,400
distributing keys to theoretically on

1465
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:45,520
path observers until the first day we do

1466
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:48,000
multipath quick then that you know then

1467
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:51,760
they won't be anyway but forget that

1468
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,410
they say you have no idea how important

1469
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,580
what you're talking what you're

1470
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:59,440
proposing yes thank you yeah I mean the

1471
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:02,320
the slide about distributing T's to

1472
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,240
unpassed observers was mostly like just

1473
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:10,349
don't even think about that kind of

1474
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:14,019
thing right with regard to the

1475
01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:15,730
exposure of the session key I think it's

1476
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:18,480
already already a bad idea especially

1477
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:21,699
for the inter-domain troubleshooting

1478
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:27,040
nobody in coming too shaky of course I

1479
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:30,219
mean this is really but on on a more

1480
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,269
larger scope I think with a spin bit the

1481
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:35,050
quick rocking group

1482
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:39,570
it's a enable enabling a framework where

1483
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:42,790
a hand hand to end point are exposing

1484
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:45,630
information which is integral which

1485
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:48,280
integrity is protected by hand to end on

1486
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:51,909
this is something that the TSV working

1487
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:54,699
group should six about encryption is not

1488
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:57,699
all the part you have integrity on

1489
01:12:54,699 --> 01:13:00,820
encryption and they should take care of

1490
01:12:57,699 --> 01:13:03,040
both not only encryption right that's

1491
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:05,579
actually a very valid point that one of

1492
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,769
the things that you get from using quick

1493
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:12,849
headers and quic protocol mechanisms is

1494
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:15,699
that you get integrity protection of

1495
01:13:12,849 --> 01:13:19,500
that of the signal and as far as the

1496
01:13:15,699 --> 01:13:23,290
endpoints are concerned so by having

1497
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:27,159
endpoints engage in this it's given

1498
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:31,510
endpoints a choice to provide the signal

1499
01:13:27,159 --> 01:13:33,848
we hope that most of them will all of

1500
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:37,090
the drafts for spin bit and for the lost

1501
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:39,219
bits involve the provisions that mostly

1502
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:41,860
they're about protocol and the protocol

1503
01:13:39,219 --> 01:13:44,489
ossification but also for privacy that a

1504
01:13:41,860 --> 01:13:48,190
small fraction of the traffic should not

1505
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:50,199
have the signal exposed it's not gonna

1506
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:52,739
compromise because very small problem a

1507
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:56,730
portion of the traffic ability to

1508
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:59,079
monitor it but it will give additional

1509
01:13:56,730 --> 01:14:01,239
protection against protocol ossification

1510
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:04,210
or some possible privacy implications

1511
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:09,190
for a minority of clients who may choose

1512
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:10,540
not to expose the signal so I'm

1513
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:12,730
conscious that we're sort of slipping

1514
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:15,099
into talking about material and not just

1515
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:16,690
raising awareness so call and I'll give

1516
01:14:15,099 --> 01:14:18,550
you the last comment on this and then

1517
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:22,360
we'll close this segment and pose the

1518
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:23,679
session okay thank you - two quick

1519
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,900
comments

1520
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:30,190
the first is in the conversational media

1521
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:34,150
world that's a fairly extensive endpoint

1522
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:35,889
reporting framework in a TCP and clearly

1523
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:38,259
that's not directly relevant for this

1524
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:39,790
but there may be some inspiration that

1525
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:44,130
you can take from that things have been

1526
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:48,519
done in that space the second is that if

1527
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:49,840
you're reporting on endpoint you know if

1528
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,270
you have endpoint reporting on the

1529
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,890
behavior of an encrypted protocol there

1530
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:55,270
are some interesting questions about the

1531
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,230
integrity of that from whether the

1532
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:00,580
network can trust

1533
01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:04,809
the reports to be accurate and thinking

1534
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:06,429
about whether there are ways of somehow

1535
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,810
validating that the reports come here

1536
01:15:06,429 --> 01:15:11,679
from the endpoints match what's actually

1537
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:14,770
going on may be useful the third great

1538
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:17,440
solution yep I know that connects

1539
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:20,500
working group has done some work in that

1540
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:24,730
regard previously I mean there are not

1541
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:28,630
enough bits for that but that's a very

1542
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:32,919
valid point and I mean theoretically you

1543
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:35,199
could have a TCP malicious TCP sender

1544
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:39,550
who is sending TCP packets that look

1545
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:42,330
like gratuitous loss so that's not an

1546
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:47,860
entirely new problem for the space but

1547
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:50,199
if it's ECP if a tcp sand tries to

1548
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:51,909
manipulate whoever it lost you know the

1549
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:54,309
information but wherever it lost packets

1550
01:15:51,909 --> 01:15:57,179
in terms of the acts it effects TC tcp

1551
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:59,679
behavior right if a quick receiver

1552
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:02,199
sending reports does the same thing it

1553
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:06,250
doesn't affect the quick perform that's

1554
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:08,678
the difference yeah okay so my takeaway

1555
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:11,230
is that our awareness has been raised on

1556
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:14,020
this topic and that the work is being

1557
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:16,989
done is currently being done in the

1558
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:19,570
quick working group so the action item

1559
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:21,639
for people here is to keep an eye on the

1560
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:24,489
work being done there and contribute

1561
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:27,310
voices and opinions as appropriate and

1562
01:16:24,489 --> 01:16:30,459
then I guess and if if further if

1563
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:32,139
furthermore code cohesive input is

1564
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,960
needed from people interested in video

1565
01:16:32,139 --> 01:16:37,659
we may add a future in a future time

1566
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:41,110
decide to try to articulate video need

1567
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:43,500
with regards this yes Ronnie not just to

1568
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:47,110
be more precise it's it's currently

1569
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:49,179
there's the work now in both in I ppm

1570
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:51,040
and quick working group and I assume

1571
01:16:49,179 --> 01:16:52,900
that today in T is the area they will

1572
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,820
try to discuss where to do future quick

1573
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:57,280
work so for that if people are

1574
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:58,449
interesting this world they should voice

1575
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,489
their opinion where it should be earned

1576
01:16:58,449 --> 01:17:03,070
Oh mostly because of the overload of all

1577
01:17:00,489 --> 01:17:04,360
these working groups right um we're

1578
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:07,409
quite sure it shouldn't be done in this

1579
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:09,460
working group so that's one off the list

1580
01:17:07,409 --> 01:17:11,769
right okay great

1581
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:14,230
thank you very much so now we've done

1582
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:16,810
one of these mops working group meetings

1583
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:19,178
and hopefully people have a better sense

1584
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:21,610
of some of the type of things that we

1585
01:17:19,179 --> 01:17:23,590
can discuss and you can be thinking of

1586
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:24,940
things that we should be you know we

1587
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:29,320
should be bringing to the table when we

1588
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:30,879
next meet so I'll ask you to do that if

1589
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,469
you're not on the mops working group

1590
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,679
mailing list you can certainly go ahead

1591
01:17:32,469 --> 01:17:37,960
and join and my last plea before we have

1592
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:39,460
a word from the area director is if you

1593
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:42,639
haven't signed the blue sheets please

1594
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:45,429
make sure you do before leaving here

1595
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:47,469
yeah responsibility for this group I'm

1596
01:17:45,429 --> 01:17:49,150
quite happy with the first meeting they

1597
01:17:47,469 --> 01:17:51,370
are at least the timing and the quick

1598
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:55,030
topic that that coming between the video

1599
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:56,920
cross area so I'm quite appear this good

1600
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:59,500
but don't sleep on this right we need to

1601
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:02,159
continue yeah yeah exactly right let's

1602
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:04,690
let's keep the keep the momentum going

1603
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:06,730
okay so blue sheets are up here for

1604
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:08,620
anyone who needs them apart from that go

1605
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:11,250
warm up thank you very much and see you

1606
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:11,250
in Vancouver

1607
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:17,079
