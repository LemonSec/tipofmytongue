1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:28,220
really easy oh we always pick on the

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:30,980
same people well I will volunteer to do

3
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:36,440
at the time what I'm not talking and I

4
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:39,350
will be there too and for anyone I know

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,940
that a lot of viewers shy including a

6
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,440
lot of people for whom English is not

7
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,379
your native language but that's the

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,629
beauty of ether part is if you get more

9
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,210
people and eat the part then it simply

10
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,980
becomes everybody is filling in the

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,410
holes of everyone else and it's a whole

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,419
lot of structure so the more people we

13
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:08,149
have an ether pad as long as you're not

14
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:09,920
like doing malicious things I highly

15
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,690
recommend it for everybody who even

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,820
wants to consider maybe getting more

17
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:19,429
involved in ATF it's a wonderful thing I

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:23,440
will get you anything past okay

19
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,240
David take it away yeah stir okay

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,000
because this is a joint session where

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,190
there are two blue sheets for each of

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,290
these things there's a home vet and at

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,399
the MSSD

24
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,340
should I talk into the microphone

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,410
there's HomeNet and DNS SD on each of

26
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,690
these and so if you're going to stay

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:48,310
here for both please put your name on

28
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:48,310
both that would be much appreciated okay

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,569
[Music]

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,470
this has the other

31
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:20,079
alright let's get started so we're gonna

32
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:22,540
start with a half hour of DNS SD and so

33
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:25,150
getting started

34
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,640
so it is Monday this is the note well

35
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,930
it's a very big slide and I'm not gonna

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,029
keep it up long enough but if you

37
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,980
haven't read the note well please

38
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,810
actually look it up in your favorite

39
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,899
search engine and actually do read it

40
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,790
you just by being here and saying things

41
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,470
you have requirements relating to

42
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,900
patents for example that you need to be

43
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,510
aware of and also the ATF has a code of

44
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,129
conduct that we will be enforcing so if

45
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,159
you're not aware of what's in that code

46
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:54,069
of conduct please go and form yourself

47
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,569
but it's pretty reasonable stuff just be

48
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,858
nice to everyone around you and

49
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:00,399
everything will go great so a few

50
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:02,439
reminders

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,209
anytime you go up to the microphone

52
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:07,299
please state your name clearly so the

53
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,239
minute taker can take it down please

54
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,579
review our documents so we keep

55
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,620
progressing them and we make sure they

56
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,870
are the highest quality output possible

57
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:22,660
and please sign the blue sheets that are

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:24,549
going around right now so we have in

59
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,150
case you're searching for the links you

60
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:30,430
can pull up these slides in the tools

61
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:34,150
these are some links mainly for people

62
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,280
that are not in the room and just a

63
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,949
usual reminder we have a github

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,079
organization and any draft author that

65
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:44,079
would like their draft on there to

66
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:46,030
facilitate collaboration should just let

67
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:50,709
us know and we'll so get that set up for

68
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:53,500
you very quickly so our main goals for

69
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:57,299
today's sessions are to get an update on

70
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:01,239
our current documents to discuss more

71
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,909
early work and discuss kind of what

72
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:08,819
we're going with all this and also our

73
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:11,679
privacy efforts so here's our agenda

74
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:15,668
specific to DNS SD not to home net so

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,639
our first half hour session has these

76
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:20,829
three items and our second session later

77
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,000
today we'll be discussing privacy would

78
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,000
anyone like to bash the

79
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,660
once twice sorry success and Stuart

80
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,969
[Music]

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,349
thank you David so I'm here to give some

82
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,610
updates on our documents the first one

83
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,140
I'm talking about is Service

84
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:07,090
registration protocol which is reminder

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:11,090
a way for devices offering services to

86
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:13,969
use a variant of DNS updates to record

87
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:17,450
that in the network as an alternative to

88
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:21,380
using multicast right now the primary

89
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,870
application of this is silikal thread

90
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,260
mesh networking which is an initiative

91
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,240
that came out of nest their home

92
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,180
thermostats and smoke detectors use this

93
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,060
it's built on the same I Triple E 802

94
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,330
dot 15.4 radio that things like ZigBee

95
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,300
use the difference is ZigBee is a

96
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,450
vertical proprietary network

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,770
architecture for everything from the

98
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,599
addressing the naming and the

99
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,229
application protocol that runs on top of

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,630
it here at the IETF we believe in the

101
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,970
longevity of IP based applications

102
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,890
because even when the hardware changes

103
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,960
the same application software carries on

104
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,349
running so that is my strong

105
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,549
predisposition the people who start at

106
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,900
the thread group have the same

107
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:12,290
philosophy and they are running 6lowpan

108
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,539
ipv6 over these I Triple E radios they

109
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,780
are quarter megabit per second roughly

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,600
ten meter range similar in range and

111
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,330
speed to Bluetooth low-energy

112
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,460
but much more IP friendly so standard IP

113
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,099
software runs over these without having

114
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,440
to be rewritten what the thread group is

115
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,700
adding is mesh networking because

116
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,620
6lowpan just defines one hop ipv6 and

117
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,139
the thread group also defines the

118
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,270
onboarding commissioning process how you

119
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,360
give a device the credentials to be on

120
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:48,469
the mesh what they don't have right now

121
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:51,410
is any firm specification for

122
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,750
self-discovery other than a sort of hand

123
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:56,750
wavey think saying well just use

124
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:01,550
multicast like Ethernet does we know

125
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:04,540
that multicast is inefficient and slow

126
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,610
and unreliable on Wi-Fi the same is true

127
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,320
even more so on these thread mesh

128
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,850
networks when you have a mesh in you're

129
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,849
forwarding the multicast multiple hops

130
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,440
to reach the whole mesh when potentially

131
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,710
only one device is interested or maybe

132
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,030
no devices is even more wasteful than

133
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:27,830
Wi-Fi so we have been proposing using

134
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,989
SRP the great opportunity here is thread

135
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,609
is a bad brand new think there is some

136
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,229
limited deployment with the nest

137
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,690
products but it's certainly not as

138
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,270
widespread as Wi-Fi is so we have an

139
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,700
opportunity to define something good

140
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,340
from the start and we don't have a

141
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,180
backwards compatibility legacy issue to

142
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,888
deal with if we could go back in time 20

143
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,160
years maybe we should have done this for

144
00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:54,139
Wi-Fi as well but we didn't so the

145
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,250
transition for Wi-Fi will take longer

146
00:07:54,139 --> 00:08:01,099
but we have a great opportunity now the

147
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:04,690
last thread all members meeting was two

148
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:08,000
weeks ago in Switzerland and I was there

149
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,349
pitching these ideas to try to get

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,280
support from the rest of the thread

151
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:14,150
community I can report that that was

152
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,900
very successful

153
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:23,630
they had they have green lighted this

154
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:25,969
for as a work item to to take on that

155
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,830
doesn't necessarily mean it will be part

156
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,930
of a future specification but if we're

157
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:34,490
successful then it will so that's a

158
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,560
great opportunity I think to start

159
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,870
thread mesh networking out right from

160
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,609
the start instead of starting with

161
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,409
multicast and then realizing it doesn't

162
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,770
work and having to retrofit something on

163
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:48,920
and then having a legacy support issue

164
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,020
part of what we want to have here is

165
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,469
thread border routers that implement

166
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,600
this SRP server and ideally make that a

167
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,460
mandatory requirements that to be a

168
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,170
certified thread border router you have

169
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,870
to implement this of course the some

170
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,760
politics involved there in getting that

171
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,020
language into the specification getting

172
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,810
everybody to agree that that's the

173
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:15,449
requirements but that's what we're going

174
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:17,910
to try to do so anybody in the room

175
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,750
who's interested in working on this we'd

176
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,439
love to have more implementations and

177
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,970
more collaboration on the document

178
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:32,010
second document to talk about is the

179
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:35,700
roadmap this needs to be updated and it

180
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,439
was not because I was away working on

181
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,510
this thread group meeting and putting

182
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,200
together all all my materials to pitch

183
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,180
these ideas there this is intended for

184
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,030
the time being to be a living document

185
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,040
that's updated to be the table of

186
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:54,180
contents for all the other documents so

187
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,000
to speak I would love to have co-authors

188
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,579
join me on this this is not absolutely

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,880
not intended to be a one-man show

190
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,940
I'm I'm often up here at the front of

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,670
the room talking about things but I

192
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,770
don't intend it to be that way so if

193
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:18,479
there's anybody interested in joining in

194
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:20,579
please don't be shy about doing that I I

195
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,690
hope Ted can hear us I know Ted was

196
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:43,230
going to add some comments as well so

197
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:45,540
okay hi there so I don't have a huge

198
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,190
amount to say but just just regarding

199
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,530
the SRP stuff I've been doing a ton of

200
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:53,910
work on the SRP stuff over the last like

201
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:56,250
you know three months and you know the

202
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:59,160
first thing to say about the spec is

203
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,550
that it seems to be proving itself to be

204
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,730
a good

205
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,410
spec I've definitely found some some

206
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,550
gaps in the spec which need to be

207
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:12,810
updated it's at this point it's getting

208
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:16,079
to be pretty mature though so I'm gonna

209
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,420
come out probably before the next IETF

210
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,649
not super before the next IETF because

211
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,349
I've got a lot of work on my plate

212
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,850
before the next IETF but I'm gonna come

213
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,820
out with a new version of the spec and

214
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:29,399
at that point I'm gonna propose that

215
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,980
people give it a serious read and we do

216
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,510
a last call on it because you know this

217
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,060
is this is a real thing that at this

218
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,200
point is you know I've got running code

219
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,119
there's gonna be an open-source version

220
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,360
of this that's out and available both

221
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:47,220
for IOT devices and for regular you know

222
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,230
hosts and it would be good to get people

223
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,459
to read over it and see if they can see

224
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,990
gaps that I missed I mean there's a

225
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,339
couple of really obvious things that I

226
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,980
missed like for example the document

227
00:11:53,339 --> 00:12:00,360
doesn't actually say how to remove an

228
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,880
SRP update and it also doesn't say what

229
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,980
to do if you're just advertising a host

230
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,750
but no services so right now the

231
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,220
document would actually reject an update

232
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:13,470
of that sort which i think is actually

233
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,029
probably wrong because because then you

234
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,200
don't actually get feature parity with

235
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:21,600
dns SD over multicast dns so things like

236
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,160
that are still still in progress and

237
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,740
need to be updated and it would be

238
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,339
really awesome if anybody's interested

239
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,839
in doing updates to this I'm hoping that

240
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,329
I'll be able to get the source code out

241
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,180
so if people want to hack on it rather

242
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,859
than writing their own from scratch

243
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,120
it'll be very adaptable that the source

244
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,640
code that I'm working on right now has

245
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,829
an adaptation layer so you can make it

246
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,800
run on whatever hardware you want by

247
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:49,620
just adding like a about ten functions

248
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,290
of you know that provides things like

249
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,890
send a UDP packet and you know wake up

250
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,050
at this time kind of stuff so that would

251
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,880
be great I think that's about all I have

252
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,050
to say about it I this is the main thing

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,490
I've been working on for the last couple

254
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,229
months so I don't really have any new

255
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,970
updates for the other stuff but

256
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,529
obviously that's still you know the the

257
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,230
particularly the relay document is still

258
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,990
hanging fire and eats needs some work

259
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,529
so because is there anything else Fitz

260
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,749
should say

261
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,850
about the story now that's good I just

262
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,889
wanted to give you a chance to update

263
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,850
because Ted and I were together at the

264
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:27,959
thread group meeting in Switzerland and

265
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:31,319
actually did a demo using some prototype

266
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:34,489
border router devices from arrow from

267
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:38,360
Linksys and the Google nest hubs and

268
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:40,079
that demo was successful and we showed

269
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,730
different vendors products

270
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:47,758
interoperating we had an iPhone running

271
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,309
the home kit app talking over Wi-Fi to

272
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:53,189
the Linksys border router over thread to

273
00:13:50,309 --> 00:13:55,529
a simulated home kit accessory alight I

274
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:57,269
guess it wasn't simulated it was a real

275
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:58,709
LED light it just wasn't a very bright

276
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,470
one this little development kit with a

277
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:04,559
surface mount LED but in terms of

278
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:08,490
software that is exactly a a home kit

279
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:12,059
controlled light and on the same thread

280
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:14,970
mesh Google was showing an Android phone

281
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:17,759
using the Google Nest software to lock

282
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,329
and unlock a door lock and to us at the

283
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,389
IETF that's not particularly remarkable

284
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:27,120
to the IOT vendors seeing different

285
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:28,920
vendors products work at the same time

286
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,180
on the same mesh was absolutely

287
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:36,209
mind-blowing so we got a lot of interest

288
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:39,449
because right now if you buy IKEA smart

289
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:41,279
LEDs you need an IKEA hub you buy

290
00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:43,680
Philips you bulbs you need a Philips hub

291
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,079
you by Comcast home security system you

292
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,319
need a Comcast hub they're all ZigBee

293
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,319
but they don't talk to each other so the

294
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:54,839
uh so the idea that a single border

295
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:57,029
router from any vendor could actually

296
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,980
support multiple different applications

297
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:03,360
at the same at the same time from two

298
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:06,240
other vendors that was remarkable so we

299
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,459
are working to to push forwards on this

300
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,769
and and demonstrate that this is real

301
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:13,349
because that's what we want we want a

302
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:15,929
world where thread is like Wi-Fi you can

303
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,569
buy one access point from pretty much

304
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:24,839
anybody and expect that all your devices

305
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:27,449
will work with it yes so yeah thank you

306
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,600
for your name Daniel amigo Eric

307
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,100
so this is a great work and I come in to

308
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,020
review the next version of the draft

309
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,740
thank you I'm not gonna review the code

310
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:44,250
but the draft yes okay thanks and thanks

311
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:47,460
Oh Stuart one thing I wanted to mention

312
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,050
about the work that Daniel is working on

313
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,140
actually Daniel you this is something

314
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:57,150
you might want to think about is that in

315
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:58,590
order to do like DNS SD well actually

316
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:01,829
nevermind I'll do that in the home that

317
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:04,440
thing it's not really a okay thing

318
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,330
all right just wait 13 minutes yeah

319
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,650
it'll require team you had off and

320
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:12,990
putting the next one on next document

321
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,720
the relay as Ted said this needs an

322
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:19,950
update

323
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,870
Ted knife both been busy would love to

324
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,240
work with us on this and I'll make this

325
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:26,630
call again I I have heard people say

326
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,180
that this is the Ted and Stuart show and

327
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:33,060
that's not our intention and if it

328
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,890
seemed like we didn't welcome other

329
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,339
people contributing I apologize for that

330
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,870
because that was never our intention

331
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,340
there was a time not so long ago when

332
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,950
Ted was not working on this and he got

333
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:45,930
interested and started working on it so

334
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,850
if Ted can do it we're definitely open

335
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:52,099
to other people getting more involved

336
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:56,370
too and then the final update I have is

337
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:59,250
on push notifications which is in the

338
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:03,840
same cluster with the discovery proxy

339
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:05,880
and this is all reviewed last call I

340
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:11,340
actually approved ready to be published

341
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:14,490
and as part of this group you may know

342
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:17,849
we have an old thing that we developed

343
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,120
at Apple like a decade ago which is the

344
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:24,079
udp-based variant of push notifications

345
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,429
now experience with this showed that

346
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,260
something that maybe we should have

347
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,810
known but it's a lesson that we learned

348
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,330
is that building your own hackie

349
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:36,030
protocol on top of UDP is rarely a good

350
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:39,629
idea and that's why push notifications

351
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,960
is defined to run over TCP and we

352
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,770
retired the

353
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,360
q documents made a new draft and we've

354
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,149
implemented it and it's been reviewed

355
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,299
and it's great and when this was

356
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:55,360
published I asked the independent stream

357
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,799
editor to publish the llq document as an

358
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,600
informational document just for the

359
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,340
historical record that this is the old

360
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,779
thing if you see these packets this is

361
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,490
what they mean but with the clear

362
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:05,500
forward reference saying don't implement

363
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:09,970
this do the new thing instead and in the

364
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:13,539
process of doing that he said I see an

365
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:16,029
IPR disclosure on this and and I

366
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:18,070
apologized to the workgroup in the ITF

367
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:20,409
that was totally my fault this was a

368
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,860
decade ago I had totally forgotten about

369
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:26,590
it so I have asked Apple legal to

370
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,939
basically apply that same IPR disclosure

371
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:33,580
to the push notifications draft offering

372
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,919
that patent under the same terms because

373
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,740
that's our intention what we said ten

374
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,679
years ago applies now big companies

375
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,620
things move slowly but I'm hopeful cross

376
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,169
fingers that literally any day now we

377
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,820
will get that disclosure in and that can

378
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,450
unblock this and then all three

379
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,139
documents can go ahead and get published

380
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,840
hopefully by the end of the ER that

381
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,899
would be nice to get to get 2019 dates

382
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,770
on these so that is the final update on

383
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:05,250
that thank you and you stirred any

384
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,250
questions

385
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:24,800
here's the summary of what Stuart just

386
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:28,340
told you there's your waiting for DNS

387
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:31,220
push which is waiting for the patent IPR

388
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,159
declaration and we have the privacy and

389
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,200
security requirements which are in

390
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:40,940
working group last call is that right

391
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,460
that's what this data said the privacy

392
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:50,630
requirements we'll be discussing at the

393
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:52,280
privacy session at 6:10 tonight the SRP

394
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,230
document is still a working group

395
00:19:52,280 --> 00:20:03,830
document and comments are welcomed and

396
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:06,860
encouraged that's the word okay so I did

397
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:09,169
send an email to the list because we

398
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,290
have owned again off again discussed do

399
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:15,950
we whatever want to recharter and so

400
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:17,870
these were some points I kind of grouped

401
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,850
some of them together that Tom buso teri

402
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,449
had brought up as things maybe to

403
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:26,889
consider there was very minimal

404
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:30,610
discussion I think there was one email

405
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,890
that said yeah maybe I don't know um

406
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:37,250
that's just my summary of it

407
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:41,210
and so I'd like to you know ask maybe

408
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:44,120
hear if any of these call out to you and

409
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,530
you know really resonate and like have

410
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:54,560
your name attached to them or something

411
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:58,910
and you'd like to see us recharter so

412
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:02,750
the the idea here is our current charter

413
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:05,240
for dns SD was really focused on losing

414
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:08,570
the dependency on multi guests and so in

415
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,330
particular like the hybrid proxy was the

416
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:15,770
main work item which is about to be

417
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:17,899
published once all that's done and like

418
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,450
the documents that Stuart was talking

419
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:23,360
about once we wrap all those up one

420
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,890
possibility is we declare success and

421
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,780
close the working rule

422
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,180
another possibility is there are other

423
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,430
topics that some people find interesting

424
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,700
so you recharter to incorporate those

425
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:36,950
into our charter and work on them but in

426
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:43,280
order to do that we need people who are

427
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:46,250
willing to pick up that work so that's

428
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,840
why like if we these are potential ideas

429
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,510
for things we can work on but if we

430
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,889
don't have individual contributors

431
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:57,470
interested in working on those then they

432
00:21:51,890 --> 00:22:02,090
won't happen anyone then Ted so Daniel

433
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:04,100
Erickson Danielle Mugu Erickson I think

434
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,730
well if you're willing to reach out her

435
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:11,389
I think maybe we should have a scope

436
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,960
that is also I mean merging the home

437
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:18,500
that activity is related to the naming

438
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:24,650
so is that item number one or something

439
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:28,580
else I don't know the ongoing work

440
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:31,430
within the home net I would say well so

441
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:35,419
we wouldn't reach order to take over

442
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:36,920
home net right so what are you sorry can

443
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:41,180
you elaborate on what you're thinking

444
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:44,750
well the thing is I believe that we need

445
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:48,710
to - I mean the work being done in DNS

446
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,810
SD is quite close to I mean they're not

447
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:55,010
independent from what is being done in

448
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:58,370
home net so it might be helpful we have

449
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:01,910
everything in one place if that simpler

450
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:04,879
that's a bit related to naming I think

451
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:07,700
that's maybe if we need to reach out

452
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,630
there but I can I'm not asking to reach

453
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,050
out or say thank you that's that's a

454
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:17,270
good point

455
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:19,810
all right Ted yeah so one point about

456
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:22,700
what Daniel actually just said is that

457
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:25,850
in order to do so remember we have this

458
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,180
thing called the DNS discovery proxy DNS

459
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:31,760
st discovery proxy it looks like an

460
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,460
authoritative server but it doesn't

461
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,740
actually retain any state

462
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,930
it's a stateless sort I mean it's got a

463
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,050
cache but essentially it's a stateless

464
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:43,730
authoritative server and one of the

465
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,620
things Daniel is working on is how do we

466
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,380
set up a secondary so that so that

467
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,750
people are hammering on the primary

468
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,890
server to get answers to questions all

469
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:57,440
the time and I think that there's

470
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:00,500
actually a problem to solve there in

471
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,820
that if we have a DNS SD discovery proxy

472
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,730
it would be nice to be able to do

473
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,620
something that has that effect but it's

474
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,410
not going to work using zone transfers

475
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:12,800
it's gonna have to work using DNS push

476
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:14,450
so so writing a document that talks

477
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,850
about how that works might be worth

478
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:21,380
doing hopefully after actually trying it

479
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:26,209
so so I think there is actually some

480
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:29,000
work to do there and you know continuing

481
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,010
on that I mean we're not done with with

482
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,480
the SRP stuff and by the way that's a

483
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,080
continuation of the moving from

484
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,060
multicast a unicast there's clearly more

485
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,480
work to do on that if only just

486
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:44,929
finishing the document but possibly also

487
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,240
after that and we haven't finished the

488
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:51,470
relay document I think that it's

489
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,940
important that we finish that so so I

490
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,430
don't think we're quite ready to say

491
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,770
we're done yet I mean maybe we're

492
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,110
getting there that's not to say that we

493
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,250
can't recharter but but I just want to

494
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:05,149
make the point that that we are

495
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,950
definitely not quite done yet and that's

496
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,200
what we Ted so I didn't mean to say that

497
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:12,470
we're done and we should all go home

498
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,150
just when those items are done the end

499
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,550
and I think the items we described fit

500
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,830
into our current Charter yeah and think

501
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,690
windows and even like that new document

502
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,780
that you just mentioned I would see that

503
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:25,670
as pertaining to the current Charter and

504
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,560
so when all of those are done would be

505
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:33,230
that situation where we might close down

506
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:35,570
yep yeah and by the way

507
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,190
unicast many discovery is actually a

508
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,350
solved problem I'm not convinced me to

509
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:43,160
do any work there because that's how PD

510
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:45,439
MSSD works generally you asked for a PTR

511
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,380
record for a service and it gives you a

512
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,270
list of all the known services on that

513
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,669
PTR record you know all that gives you a

514
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,109
list of PTR records

515
00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:55,970
for each of the services that provide

516
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:59,509
each of the servers that provide that

517
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:01,159
service so I'm not if there is a problem

518
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:03,909
to solve there it's not clear to me from

519
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:09,139
the bullet item what that problem is

520
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:11,690
okay thanks Ted so ray and then Tim I'll

521
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:14,418
come on to vary hunter here I'll be

522
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,340
speaking later on to my own slides but

523
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:19,059
just a back up on Ted that I think

524
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:21,320
there's a big gap at a minute on

525
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:23,509
implementation experience around naming

526
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,279
how this all fits together and I'm not

527
00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:28,970
sure we need a document on it but we

528
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,749
certainly need running code thank you

529
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,749
that's really good feedback

530
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,749
Tim Wattenberg I'll actually second what

531
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:40,609
ray just said about working code I think

532
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:42,950
that's that's quite something which

533
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:44,779
might be which might be something

534
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,330
achievable which achievable I think

535
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:49,970
there there's quite some code and as

536
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,830
Stuart presented some time ago it's also

537
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,519
for example available in the in the

538
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,230
github repo but yeah there might be more

539
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,019
than one implementation which might be

540
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,859
nice that's my first point the second

541
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:07,399
point would be that as we said earlier

542
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:11,600
the current Charter is kind of focused

543
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:14,119
around reducing multicast traffic and I

544
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,309
think what we are seeing right now for

545
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:19,549
example also with what Stuart presented

546
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:22,720
earlier with this threat model let's

547
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:27,289
call it like this and also other

548
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,749
techniques Laura or whatever so there's

549
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:32,149
still a need for service discovery maybe

550
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:35,840
in domains which are not specific to

551
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:38,600
this multicast problem but we're still

552
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,149
we need to kind of solve the idea of how

553
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,830
how is service discovery implemented in

554
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:44,209
in those areas and I think much of the

555
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,639
work which has been done in this working

556
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,919
group could be applied for that but

557
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:53,330
probably there's there are some ideas

558
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:55,759
which yeah which we might ooh to think

559
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,730
through in this perspective as well and

560
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,649
that might be actually something it's

561
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,749
it's has been a time that I read through

562
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:04,369
the Charter but maybe I this is

563
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:06,630
something where we chattering would be

564
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:08,760
good to specify or to to make

565
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,250
make it point that it's not only about

566
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,990
multicast but also other transport

567
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:17,750
mechanisms where service describe

568
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:24,480
service discovery is needed will want it

569
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:27,179
thanks Tim I'm hearing a common theme

570
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,520
people talk about more code experience

571
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,120
I'm really happy to hear that so I'm

572
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,100
going to make a suggestion we have been

573
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,250
using the hackathon time at the IETF

574
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:42,030
meetings but it's often just been me and

575
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:43,980
Ted or me and Ted and Tim maybe we can

576
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,629
make a plan for the next hackathon to

577
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,700
have a concrete list of things that

578
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,190
we're going to work on so if anybody is

579
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,770
interested in and willing to contribute

580
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,980
to that send an email to the list or

581
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:57,570
privately to me and Ted and let's make

582
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,660
an actual plan of some concrete things

583
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:03,120
we want to achieve at the next hackathon

584
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,130
Stuart can I give you the action item of

585
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,139
coming up with that original list and

586
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,490
posting you know a list of two things to

587
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,950
work on the next second I'm putting on

588
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:13,700
the list for comment yes I will I will

589
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:16,140
send out a suggested list and I welcome

590
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,549
input from other people about what they

591
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:24,620
think that the priorities to work on

592
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:27,990
thank you staring alright so we are

593
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,709
pretty much out of we have one minute

594
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,400
left

595
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:36,419
so thanks I think the current documents

596
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,850
are in good shape so we're gonna leave

597
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,010
that at that I'm gonna quickly plug we

598
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,909
have our second session on the third

599
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:48,080
session today at 6:10 p.m. we'll all be

600
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:53,070
discussing privacy and specifically

601
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,540
today if you use em DNS DNS SD the names

602
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:57,168
and everything and the services are in

603
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,480
the clear and we're looking at ways to

604
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:01,950
make these things encrypted so an

605
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,500
attacker who's on the same network as

606
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:06,299
you doesn't know what you're certain

607
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,270
what services you're searching for or

608
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,860
the name of your devices so if you think

609
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,309
that could be interesting he's come back

610
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:17,129
I yeah I think it's yeah in this room at

611
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:20,510
6:10 all right I think we're going to

612
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:20,510
switch over to home it

613
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,329
[Music]

614
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:42,329
[Music]

615
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,320
so yeah

616
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,209
is it possible to continue on jabber

617
00:30:52,320 --> 00:31:00,178
scribe um but simply on the home net

618
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:03,929
jabber that would be much appreciated

619
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:10,950
and the note-taking is now going to move

620
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:13,769
over to the home net etherpad hey can

621
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:16,260
you tee up a few more things and I'm

622
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:35,940
gonna open up the ether pad or well like

623
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:38,100
you see you're on jabber just the

624
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,100
medical folks let us know that they're

625
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,879
gonna keep the DNS SD jabber for home

626
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,949
net so maybe we can keep or can I drop a

627
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:55,019
scribe just keep an eye on both is that

628
00:31:46,950 --> 00:32:01,620
okay thanks the same note well applies

629
00:31:55,019 --> 00:32:03,570
go figure and we've just discussed the

630
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,070
same blue sheet supply and if you

631
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,658
haven't signed the blue sheets where are

632
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,760
the blue sheets and anybody need blue

633
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,440
sheets and again there are two sets of

634
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,419
blue sheets reach blue sheets there's

635
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:19,700
the DNS SD blue sheets and the HomeNet

636
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:30,210
blue sheets and please sign both okay no

637
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:32,580
no okay so first up is going to be the

638
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,890
home naming architecture this

639
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,260
the agenda what wait we have to give

640
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:41,750
people a chance to eat bash anybody want

641
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:52,590
a bash look nobody wants to bash um

642
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:58,799
just real quick before I'm just it's

643
00:32:52,590 --> 00:33:00,090
just it's just okay so I did just have

644
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,740
you know kind of like the other one

645
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:06,720
here's the status there are three drafts

646
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,750
so right now we're going to be talking

647
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,970
about so the first one is just sitting

648
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,039
there hanging out in Babel and that is

649
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:15,630
it's waiting for the Babel reference to

650
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:17,700
be done and it's just waiting and

651
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:19,769
waiting and we don't have anything to do

652
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,019
with that then the next one um Daniel

653
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:25,080
did just update and he's going to be

654
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:26,970
discussing that on the HNC P that we'll

655
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,399
be discussing today doesn't have a draft

656
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:31,919
actually and then there's Ted's draft

657
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:33,989
which hasn't been updated in a while but

658
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,490
it is awaiting implementations and again

659
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,210
you know the hackathon that Stuart

660
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,919
mentioned is valid for that as well

661
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:46,559
hopefully oh look it's Ted lemon you

662
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:51,120
want to let him in maybe well Steven you

663
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,940
need to push it harder there you go fYI

664
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,459
the the HomeNet the simple helmet naming

665
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,929
stuff there is actually I've been doing

666
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,010
some implementation work on that it's a

667
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:01,710
little bit farther in the rear view

668
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:04,200
mirror than three months but but we have

669
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:07,710
some some running code that does little

670
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,240
pieces of that and I I think there's

671
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:12,179
been other work that's been done on that

672
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:13,770
as well so so that's there is actually

673
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:20,460
ongoing work it's not just it would be

674
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:23,820
nice if somebody did something quick

675
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:27,270
comment on it to make about H NCP for

676
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,889
the thread group work that Ted and I

677
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,500
have been looking at there is this

678
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,240
question what if you have multiple

679
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:36,810
thread border routers on your network

680
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:39,569
and the thread network is a sufficiently

681
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:41,040
dissimilar technology to Ethernet and

682
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,980
Wi-Fi that it doesn't make sense to

683
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,418
bridge it so today quite often with

684
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,109
Wi-Fi you just bridge it with the

685
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:47,638
ethernet you have

686
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:49,859
multiple access points it's all bridge

687
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:54,629
together with thread that isn't an

688
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:56,098
option so there has been in the existing

689
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:58,618
members of the thread group there's been

690
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:03,509
some hand wavy statements about Oh H NCP

691
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:06,210
salts that I think I think this that's a

692
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:08,609
very strong candidate and we need to

693
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:12,239
actually implement it so okay and the H

694
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:15,150
NCP discussion is part two and we've got

695
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,890
some slides on that and so thank you for

696
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,079
teeing that up but you're just a little

697
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:21,960
premature Stewart now we're going to

698
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,839
talk with Daniel and regarding the

699
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,319
status there is another draft I am that

700
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:32,308
is looking at DHCP options to provision

701
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:36,119
the outsourcing infrastructure we have

702
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:42,049
to see how valid it is when that's gonna

703
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:46,739
be done so also seeing whom that

704
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:48,930
authoritative naming service so it's an

705
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:59,359
old draft next slide

706
00:35:48,930 --> 00:36:02,509
oh yeah that's me so we basically

707
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:08,460
rewrote the document I think pretty much

708
00:36:02,509 --> 00:36:13,079
the full document what changed is that

709
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:16,489
we specified I mean the protocol that is

710
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,400
used in order for the between the

711
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:22,440
HomeNet way authoritative naming the

712
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,619
naming Authority and the outsourcing

713
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:31,079
infrastructure we reviewed the names the

714
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:35,819
terminology as well I mean ray did an

715
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,529
implementation of that so some of the

716
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:41,249
design shows have been driven by the

717
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:44,009
implementation and there is a concrete

718
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:47,249
interest in deploying it so the next

719
00:36:44,009 --> 00:36:51,119
step is I think from well my expectation

720
00:36:47,249 --> 00:36:54,259
is that we review the draft try to see

721
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,019
if we can clarify some things between us

722
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:59,370
and then it's in my opinion is going to

723
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:08,580
be pretty much closed

724
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:14,880
working guru that's cold so this is the

725
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:17,279
high-level picture so but that's fine

726
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:24,600
that's fine our things in it is on it

727
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:41,970
say so so I I'm not going to touch any

728
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:48,089
button to have a pointer okay so um okay

729
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:50,250
easier so um well so this is a starting

730
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:53,850
point from the naming architecture

731
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:56,430
within a home net and so these are all

732
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:59,700
the things we a little bit influenced by

733
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:01,470
the simple naming architecture these are

734
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,080
the functional functionalities that we

735
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:06,089
are dealing with but the one way you're

736
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,540
going to talk about regarding

737
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:12,180
outsourcing is really this one so you

738
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,529
have a public zone and it needs to be

739
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:19,620
outsourced so that any resolution here

740
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:21,360
on the public home net authoritative

741
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,990
servers um

742
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:28,230
can be done on the Internet so the idea

743
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,709
is that within your home net you for

744
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:33,660
people on the internet they will not

745
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:37,260
reach your home networks but instead

746
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:42,720
you're able to outsource this to cloud

747
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:44,940
firm or any cloud provider just a quick

748
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,470
note from remote it's quite hard because

749
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,200
the people cannot see what you're

750
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:51,299
pointing at so okay maybe you want to

751
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,279
say what you're pointing at so that they

752
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:59,040
can follow okay yeah so should I repeat

753
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:07,010
so this is a starting point of the I'm

754
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:07,009
not pointing anything so it's a bit some

755
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,769
[Laughter]

756
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,669
so there is nothing to find this is a

757
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:21,038
global picture of what we're moving on

758
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:25,660
for the network the naming architecture

759
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:28,869
in the home networks and the also saying

760
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,759
the the the related parts of the

761
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:35,019
outsourcing is just one piece of that

762
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:37,690
and it's the one represented in red so

763
00:39:35,019 --> 00:39:40,899
where you have a connections between a

764
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:45,490
home metal 30 and the distributed master

765
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:48,039
as well as the home the the one

766
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:50,979
represented in black here the home net

767
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:53,289
authoritative servers and maybe some

768
00:39:50,980 --> 00:40:05,980
relations with the resolver which is

769
00:39:53,289 --> 00:40:08,079
represented in blue so next step so the

770
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:12,220
home that naming authorities what it

771
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:17,319
basically does it builds a zone for the

772
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:21,368
home net is that is expected to be

773
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:24,279
reached from outside of the internet so

774
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:27,190
it's basically the zone of device that

775
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:31,569
you expect to be published on the wild

776
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:34,269
Internet we're using DNS SEC so the idea

777
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:37,808
is that the home that is generating is

778
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:41,258
key keep its key very secret sign the

779
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:47,140
zone and push the zone to the

780
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:52,480
outsourcing infrastructure so the only

781
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:55,029
thing that is a so it's a quite a simple

782
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,990
mechanisms but what we would like to

783
00:40:55,029 --> 00:41:00,940
have is a way to automate it that and to

784
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:04,959
make that easy to configure so that it

785
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:10,500
can actually be deployed at scale which

786
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,500
means on very various aamna travelers

787
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:17,980
yeah so you have the key for the DNS and

788
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:21,849
you because you you the home metal

789
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:25,310
thority is going to out upload the file

790
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:27,860
to also sing infrastructure

791
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,950
it needs to be authenticated those two

792
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:33,470
parties so we using another set of keys

793
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:40,549
which is only restricted for the

794
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:45,020
authentication so the resolver so when

795
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:49,520
you are in a in your home net you want

796
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:52,310
to access also the domain name that are

797
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,530
being published outside on the

798
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,890
outsourcing infrastructure so suppose

799
00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:00,020
you are using cloud for cloud for

800
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:04,089
resourcing for you your home needs own

801
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:07,850
and you have a connectivity disruptions

802
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:11,990
so you want to be able to reach from

803
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:16,040
your home net your names that are we

804
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:19,520
will read out example.com or let's say

805
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:22,160
nasty example.com you want to be able to

806
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,280
reach in within your internet home net

807
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,779
even though you have a connectivity

808
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:33,410
disruptions how you can do that well

809
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:37,100
it's basically having a way to reach the

810
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:39,830
what is in the public zone it's inside

811
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:42,290
the home net so you could have an home

812
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:52,100
net authoritative service that is doing

813
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:58,630
that for you okay so that's the big

814
00:42:52,100 --> 00:43:04,009
picture well I mean it's more zoom so

815
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:06,170
the important concept are oh yeah but

816
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:14,510
there is a camera here no and I should

817
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:16,840
not move yeah okay so I can read here so

818
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:20,020
you have the home that naming Authority

819
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,580
you have a public zone and he's doing is

820
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,500
outsourcing the zone on the outsourcing

821
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:28,460
infrastructure so you have a control

822
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:31,070
channel synchronization channel and the

823
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,640
anthem endpoint where is pushing that

824
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,880
zone is called the distribution master

825
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,348
yeah

826
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,859
the distribution master

827
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:45,359
so this distribution master is is then

828
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:47,609
responsible for distributing this zone

829
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,220
again within the cloud infrastructure

830
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:52,890
but it's not pretty much the purpose of

831
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:56,189
the home network this is really the

832
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:59,609
purpose of the cloud provider so what we

833
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:04,349
focus our draft on is to define how you

834
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:08,210
can control a configure the distribution

835
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:11,849
master the relations between the HMA and

836
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:18,450
the distribution master and how you can

837
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:21,239
sync your zone between the two so so

838
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:23,220
that's a yeah the main part and as I

839
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:26,819
mentioned you need to have an authority

840
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:29,488
of servers inside your home net in case

841
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:32,460
of Internet connectivity disruptions and

842
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:35,670
this is where the home net resolver is

843
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:39,799
going to probably resolve inside the

844
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:42,710
internet so you can definitely see a

845
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:46,920
small problem here is that your resolver

846
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:50,579
that is that has to resolve dot

847
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:54,119
example.com is not going to go on the

848
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:57,420
internet it is going to go on the home

849
00:44:54,119 --> 00:45:01,229
net alternative servers most probably in

850
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:03,660
which case he needs to have it needs to

851
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:08,239
be provisions and configure to do that

852
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,960
it's not gonna be done magically Ted

853
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:11,369
Daniel can you talk

854
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,940
sorry Dave can you talk just briefly

855
00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:16,920
about why it's useful to be able to get

856
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,630
an answer about something that's on the

857
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,519
home that when the home net connectivity

858
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:24,719
isn't present nothing it's not I'm just

859
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:26,640
curious what your rationale is so the

860
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:30,210
question is why do we need to have the

861
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,819
home net wealth or ative service I mean

862
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:35,339
now the question is suppose the home

863
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:37,769
that is not doesn't have connectivity to

864
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:39,900
the internet yeah why is it important to

865
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:41,910
be able to get a question answered about

866
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,489
the service on the home net during that

867
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:49,190
period another thing it's not but that's

868
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:51,170
yeah that's the question well

869
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:54,380
the prison is that well it's a

870
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:58,160
requirement from from the initial home

871
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:00,049
net document but it's because if you

872
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,589
want to access your video server or

873
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:05,720
music server you don't have the the

874
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:09,259
connectivity to access it from outside

875
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:12,049
so but when you're connected inside you

876
00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:13,309
still need you okay so it's wire it's

877
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:18,410
while you're at home not while you're

878
00:46:13,309 --> 00:46:20,329
away so Michael Richardson here so Ted

879
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,788
but an indigent answer the question a

880
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:26,180
little bit differently um the reason why

881
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:30,259
you don't wish to use video server dot

882
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:32,390
home darpa is because the TLS

883
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:35,029
certificate won't match up and then

884
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:36,319
you'll get all upset and frustrated and

885
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:37,609
then you'll learn to click the right bad

886
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,519
warnings that they don't want you to

887
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:42,589
click on so if if you did have security

888
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:45,500
then we'd like the name to resolve

889
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:47,269
correctly within the home net even when

890
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,279
you're not just not connected so that

891
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:50,990
you can do that and in particular one of

892
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:54,859
the names that you probably would like

893
00:46:50,990 --> 00:47:00,049
to reach is your home router so you can

894
00:46:54,859 --> 00:47:00,710
find out why you don't have internet or

895
00:47:00,049 --> 00:47:10,599
fix it

896
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:10,599
right does that make sense the room I

897
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:16,490
just I want to say what Michael said

898
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:18,200
it's so that you can have one device I

899
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:20,180
moves across the boundary to always use

900
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,098
the same name so if your mobile phones

901
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:24,019
connected en-us and there's some

902
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,670
security on there you always use the

903
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:26,180
same name where they you're connected to

904
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:39,559
the Wi-Fi

905
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:41,299
whether you're connected to 4G is that

906
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:45,880
fine I mean do we have any questions

907
00:47:41,299 --> 00:47:45,880
regarding this or no

908
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:52,299
two channels so we have the control

909
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:54,880
channel and so I think the the important

910
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,640
things to realize about this control

911
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,470
channel is that basically we exchanging

912
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:07,120
some configurations between the the two

913
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:10,060
how and so how we do that we were using

914
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,740
a special way to do that is that the the

915
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:16,720
information is carried by DNS messages

916
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:19,709
so it's important to realize that it's

917
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,290
only we only using the DNS format and

918
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:27,700
they are interpreted in a certain way by

919
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:32,320
the the other hand both ends I mean so

920
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:34,680
when the a chain h h n a wants to

921
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:40,570
retrieve some parameters he is using a

922
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:44,589
an XF our query and when he's willing to

923
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:51,850
push some informations is is using a DNS

924
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:55,180
update yeah so the reason we did not go

925
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:59,080
we did not use HTTP or JSON object is

926
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:01,480
that while we were working out with DNS

927
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,380
libraries all the DNS libraries have

928
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,120
this messages and so it was much easier

929
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:10,960
much lightweight to use this way to

930
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:13,000
carry the information then the

931
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,720
synchronization channel we're using a

932
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,420
primary secondary relation and

933
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,020
distribution channel is almost out of

934
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:25,930
scope of the home net so securing the

935
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:30,370
channels so the control channel is

936
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:34,270
authenticated and encrypted using TLS so

937
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:39,609
we basically did I mean a common way to

938
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:43,509
to secure DNS exchanges to use a TC but

939
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:45,790
we we remove that we did not really

940
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:47,730
consider this because well you have the

941
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:53,520
symmetric keys that have to be renew and

942
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:57,280
provision so we basically only use TLS a

943
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,650
question that was raised is that do we

944
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,750
really need to

945
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:06,420
protect with TLS the synchronization

946
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:11,550
channel given that the I mean the the

947
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:15,720
content of the public zone is exactly to

948
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:18,630
be public and it's signed with DNS SEC

949
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:22,770
so this is one of the comment we we

950
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:26,850
received so I'd like to receive I mean

951
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:33,450
to see if there are any any any ideas

952
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:36,839
any any thoughts on that sometimes

953
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:40,919
there's a draft in deprive on XF or over

954
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:43,530
TLS now that's relatively recent is that

955
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:49,680
what you're considering using here well

956
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:52,470
so yeah everything is over TLS so maybe

957
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:58,710
I have to dig work why we need a draft

958
00:50:52,470 --> 00:51:05,100
on yeah that's a yeah okay it's

959
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:06,690
basically what we write yeah right

960
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:12,450
ballots I see so I couldn't go back once

961
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:14,910
like lose time on the D s sending for

962
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,710
the DNS SEC could I suggest you please

963
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,420
look at using CD s instead of D s

964
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:21,000
because that already has the specific

965
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:23,840
semantics that it's for a child publish

966
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:27,360
its das record to its parent so in

967
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:29,220
conformance servers they can

968
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:31,020
automatically handle taken CD s from the

969
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,270
child and push it up into their parents

970
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:37,470
own rather than needing some separated

971
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:39,060
by a mechanism yeah so this will be the

972
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:43,680
purpose of the outsourcing

973
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:48,270
infrastructure and so what we are saying

974
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:49,620
is basically that we we leave that to

975
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:53,850
the outsourcing infrastructure they

976
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:57,089
could use the CD s or any EPP mechanisms

977
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:59,060
but a published CD s record already

978
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:02,490
means please send this to my parents

979
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:05,850
yeah exactly well that's false yeah so

980
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:10,049
okay so with it I mean when I provide

981
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:12,390
the home Nets own I'm signing it having

982
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:15,059
the CD s in that yeah

983
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:17,180
okay delis so yes NCDs Rollins yes and

984
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:20,309
it should yeah yeah yeah yeah so just

985
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:23,069
Ross yeah it's not in the draft but

986
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:24,930
thanks for so as a time check I think

987
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:31,529
we're down to eight minutes okay so

988
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:34,499
question and Q raise this one reply to

989
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:35,930
Rea Bella's definitely use CDF for

990
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:38,669
ongoing operations over the

991
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:40,348
synchronization channel but and you can

992
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:43,680
use as a standard for that not

993
00:52:40,349 --> 00:52:46,049
implements it already using CD s records

994
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,700
fully aware of that but the problem is

995
00:52:46,049 --> 00:52:49,950
we've got to establish trust for the

996
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,339
initial operations and you can't do that

997
00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:56,038
on scale using the existing mechanisms

998
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:58,288
so what we do is we publish a DES record

999
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:01,019
over the control channel when we're

1000
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:04,140
using this certificate on the TR so to

1001
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:07,348
establish the initial trust for the DES

1002
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:11,970
record does that make sense than why we

1003
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:13,400
did not so so I think these are good

1004
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:16,109
things to discuss on the mailing list

1005
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,640
and I also had a question myself about

1006
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,869
things like factory reset but maybe that

1007
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,089
maybe that's in the draft and I just

1008
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:23,730
need to read the registration of it

1009
00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:25,920
by the same mechanism by the if this is

1010
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:28,499
the certificate establishes the trust

1011
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,599
but so again I think there are those are

1012
00:53:28,499 --> 00:53:33,538
good things to discuss on the list

1013
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:35,009
welcome ray I think you're up next

1014
00:53:33,539 --> 00:53:39,989
anyway so do you want to just stay there

1015
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:42,420
sure okay yeah

1016
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:46,289
so let's let's take trying it take

1017
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,880
discussion of this to the list just a

1018
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:49,440
quick introduction you've probably never

1019
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,160
seen me before that I've been working

1020
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:56,160
with the ITF since about 2010 or 2009 I

1021
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,230
believe I first started taking part I

1022
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,200
don't turn into trouble nowadays because

1023
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:03,239
try to minimize the co2 and I also like

1024
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,730
staying at home as well anyway but you

1025
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:10,349
can always grab me v6 ops at glow was

1026
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:12,839
dead net for IETF work I'm basically a

1027
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:15,749
network consultant more operational type

1028
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:19,440
person than a coder and this I do pro

1029
00:54:15,749 --> 00:54:21,328
bono for the idea and I actually own my

1030
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,910
money as a program manager believe it or

1031
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:27,119
not because the tech nice techie stuff

1032
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:28,828
doesn't pay and your next slide that's

1033
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:35,609
enough about me let's talk about the

1034
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:37,289
technology yes sorry the question an

1035
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,960
asteroid reached an excellent point

1036
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:43,650
about H NCP's

1037
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:47,700
h n CP evolution is when I posted to the

1038
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:53,039
list in the last few months about H n CP

1039
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:56,640
the response I got was we're done that's

1040
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:59,640
definitely water I'd like to talk about

1041
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,160
in my few minutes here is are we done

1042
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:04,920
with H n CP because what I've been doing

1043
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,379
is I've been hacking with H n CP as well

1044
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:10,619
as implementing the previous draft that

1045
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:13,499
we talked about and identifying missing

1046
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:16,039
what's in H n CP well from the simple

1047
00:55:13,499 --> 00:55:19,769
naming draft that dead wrote arms the

1048
00:55:16,039 --> 00:55:20,759
front of naming delegation that written

1049
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:23,609
together with Daniel

1050
00:55:20,759 --> 00:55:25,710
you know those I'm coming to the

1051
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:29,190
conclusion that we are missing stuff in

1052
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:32,009
H n CP so what I've been doing is I've

1053
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:34,650
looked at for example how it fragments

1054
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:37,559
on the network and I've put in a patch

1055
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:39,930
for the existing implementation to

1056
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:44,460
reduce the number of a ipv6 broad

1057
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:49,680
fragment so any questions on this

1058
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:52,739
particular slide no no no okay next

1059
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,839
slide and so the point Barbara is I

1060
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:57,359
haven't actually put any draft on at the

1061
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:59,940
minute and there's a reason for that is

1062
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:01,890
I'm not sure what we want to do in the

1063
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:04,140
work group for H and CP and whether

1064
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,279
there's any appetite to do it so that's

1065
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,980
why I thought we'd just put these

1066
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:09,749
questions out there is both of our

1067
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,489
drafts need more functions and are

1068
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:14,669
currently available in the

1069
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:22,319
implementation of H NCP the ball gateway

1070
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:25,920
to other technologies ray has much of

1071
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,519
raised okay so there are gaps in what H

1072
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,710
NCP is doing for us and we lost you for

1073
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:33,470
a second because their primary and

1074
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:35,720
secondary service config

1075
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:37,399
Gateway's and other specialist functions

1076
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:40,040
that we may want to run on the UM

1077
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:43,520
narrator and the point I'd make is that

1078
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:46,400
the h and CP in the RFC's have been

1079
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,920
published they assume or appear to

1080
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,550
assume that all nodes are created equal

1081
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:55,400
and there's no actual configuration or

1082
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:57,590
tiebreak mechanism to say that actually

1083
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,300
nowadays a bit bigger than node basis

1084
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:05,750
it's better to run these central

1085
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:08,450
functions on a and B so what I'm asking

1086
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:11,210
is do we want to keep all of our nodes

1087
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:13,580
equal and it go for fully distributed

1088
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:15,500
environment for net or do we want to

1089
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:18,380
encourage specialization of some

1090
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:21,440
services and some things like not

1091
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:24,200
unbound external route I've done some

1092
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:27,080
work on that it took 25 megabytes of

1093
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:29,118
overlay now that's not big for an ass

1094
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:32,000
box assuming you've got an ass box in

1095
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:37,130
your net but for a Wi-Fi router that's

1096
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,410
enormous so I've got a tp-link router

1097
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:41,300
and that comes with eight Meg's of flash

1098
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:45,230
and most of that's taken up with the

1099
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:47,450
core of open wrt so if you put all of

1100
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:49,460
this extra stuff on top and don't

1101
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:51,500
actually need to enable it but for

1102
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:54,800
example a central DNS server

1103
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:56,510
you've suddenly made your small box very

1104
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,790
expensive by the addition of four

1105
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:00,500
dollars of extra flags which doesn't

1106
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:03,170
send a lot of money but in the cutthroat

1107
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:07,369
world of and devices four dollars is a

1108
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:09,200
lot of money per device and then I come

1109
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:12,109
under the question of how do we want to

1110
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,899
do this do we want of tlvs for each

1111
00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:18,470
function or do we want to come up with a

1112
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:21,920
draft something like embedded SRV our

1113
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:24,259
ass into a TLV so that you can elect a

1114
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,790
master and then bootstrap the service

1115
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,190
and this would come to something like

1116
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:31,520
Stuart talked about where you would want

1117
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:33,890
to put in an SRV record for a gateway

1118
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,349
device and then elect the gateway

1119
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:38,118
devices depending on whether you want to

1120
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:43,320
elect one or whether you want to elect

1121
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:45,930
multiple gateway devices so those

1122
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,940
what I'm asking for feedback or no and I

1123
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:51,950
spoke very quickly about the slides to

1124
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:51,950
give some time for feedback in questions

1125
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,170
okay so we have Daniel in the room I'm

1126
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:06,840
Ted I think it's still in the queue so

1127
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:08,220
Ted it's not clear to me how to switch

1128
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:14,700
like this we try hit the button a couple

1129
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:16,549
times and see what happens yeah okay so

1130
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:19,169
a couple things first of all I'm really

1131
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,220
delighted working on this I've been

1132
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:21,390
following the work that he's been doing

1133
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,160
but I haven't really had time to

1134
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:26,910
participate because I've been working on

1135
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:29,660
the SRP stuff so I'm hoping that that

1136
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:34,560
will have a chance to work on this

1137
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:38,040
before the next ITF and if not then then

1138
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:39,990
in that at least in that zone I think

1139
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:42,900
that it's a bit of a red herring to

1140
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,220
worry about Flash space because I don't

1141
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,290
think that that's really the direction

1142
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:50,689
that things are going at this point if

1143
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:53,130
we were to require that routers provide

1144
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:56,640
in a flash base to do this stuff

1145
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:59,160
correctly and if there were demand for

1146
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,049
this functionality I think that that the

1147
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,430
the difference in the price of the flash

1148
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:04,830
first of all I don't think would be four

1149
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:07,140
dollars for the part I think would be

1150
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:08,580
quite a bit less than that because the

1151
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:12,480
amount of additional flash isn't that

1152
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:15,990
much but secondly I think that you know

1153
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:19,770
that were for the the day when things

1154
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:26,669
were raising Thank You Ted did you lose

1155
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:31,230
me come back Internet connectivity is

1156
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:33,510
wonderful so anyway so I think worrying

1157
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:35,910
about footprint is probably not that

1158
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:37,110
important that said I think it is

1159
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:38,879
certainly the case that there will be

1160
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:43,200
primary and secondary and we should

1161
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,130
figure out how to do that um so thanks

1162
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,379
we have a couple of people here in the

1163
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:48,330
room in the queue and zero minutes but

1164
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:49,950
so a brief that should work Michael

1165
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:54,120
Richardson here so I'm gonna agree with

1166
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:58,049
Ted for the reason that if you are if

1167
01:00:54,120 --> 01:01:01,350
you look at the market for 100 Meg plus

1168
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:04,710
fiber-to-the-home type devices they are

1169
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:06,390
not the 30 for the twenty dollar devices

1170
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:08,460
they are upwards and hundreds of dollars

1171
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:10,680
on that couple bucks for extra flash is

1172
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,870
probably okay it's only in the little

1173
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,669
unity devices that you stick in our

1174
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:18,060
pockets and bring to the IETF with us

1175
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:19,410
that it's a six dollar it event so time

1176
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:21,810
did you wanna yeah I just want to say oh

1177
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:23,520
great your good luck but would say that

1178
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:27,150
okay the way we can actually just finish

1179
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,180
our kind of data tiny but so I got off

1180
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:31,620
to produce basically three different

1181
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:33,750
images we're gonna have to come up with

1182
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:45,810
a heavy image for the big devices and a

1183
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:48,870
light image for the small devices okay

1184
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:50,820
and I think with that we're at a time

1185
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:52,020
hopefully people will take these topics

1186
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:56,850
to the mailing list and we can discuss

1187
01:01:52,020 --> 01:02:02,550
them there thank you and DN SSD is in

1188
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:05,160
this room at 1680 1810 which happens to

1189
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:13,200
be 610 depending on if you're 12 hour 8

1190
