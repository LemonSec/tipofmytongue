Barry for doing that note well we just

22
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,640
read and of course one of the things

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,390
that we always mention is document

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,099
management we were a small group so we

25
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,160
always expect you know if people write

26
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:29,470
documents they need to be reviewed

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,049
please volunteer for that and and do it

28
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,060
and put your comments to the mailing

29
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,270
list even though there are just comments

30
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,000
of I like it and I have no further

31
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:44,349
comments it further up in the meeting

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,130
will get to a point where that sometimes

33
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:49,950
fails what are the particular questions

34
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:54,640
that we have for this meeting is

35
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,410
document Shepherd's every document need

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,730
to document Shepherd when it's ready to

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:03,190
the is G so far the Jim and I have

38
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:06,099
always sort of like search for a

39
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,290
document Shepherd just before a document

40
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:12,670
was submitted to the iesg or when it was

41
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:14,429
already submitted we had a

42
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,160
jes tchen from other working groups

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,709
we're looking for a document Shepard

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,130
during adopting a document for the

45
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:28,030
working group would be a good idea

46
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:30,850
because at that time the the volunteer

47
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,130
that is shepherding the documents also

48
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,650
is aware that it needs to follow the

49
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:40,840
process while the document goes through

50
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,519
the working group what we are sort of

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,860
like worrying whether or not we should

52
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,290
make that compulsory so when we are

53
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,160
adopting a document that a document

54
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:54,370
author should be looking for a document

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,350
Shepard of course the document Shepard

56
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,690
should be somewhat it is not one of the

57
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:03,340
author's should be sort of like

58
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,630
independent but he needs to follow the

59
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,970
document in Harrison counties and

60
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:12,160
berries at the mic so thank you for this

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,340
is Barry thank you for picking on one of

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,200
my real pet projects a while ago I wrote

63
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,620
a document about extended document

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,570
shepherding and it didn't it didn't go

65
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,210
anywhere as a publication but it's in

66
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,460
the working group chairs wiki so anybody

67
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,260
who wants to look at that can go to the

68
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,020
working group chairs wiki which is

69
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,409
accessible to everyone and read that and

70
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,330
it's my opinion on how to keep documents

71
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,370
moving along by active shepherding

72
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,260
throughout the life of the document so

73
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,910
thank you for for feeding into that I

74
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:49,300
agree that it's a good idea not to make

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,130
it mandatory but encouraging that to

76
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,260
happen will keep documents moving and

77
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,180
remember as you should no matter how you

78
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,580
Shepherd a document no matter when it's

79
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,500
assigned the document Shepherd job is

80
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,200
not just to write the Shepherd right up

81
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,880
and then disappear we really want the

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,030
Shepherd to poke people and make sure

83
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,830
that things don't get forgotten which

84
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,719
often happens when there are comments

85
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,440
and then it takes months to resolve them

86
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,240
so thanks and having said that Barry the

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,139
being a dog document Shepherd is not

88
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,210
that hard or they're difficult it is an

89
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,650
excellent opportunity for people who are

90
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,049
new to the working group or new to the

91
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:31,500
IDF to get used to the broad

92
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,500
the process you don't have to have real

93
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,370
content-wise knowledge but just to be

94
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,628
able to follow the process meaning that

95
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,509
the only thing you really have to do is

96
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:46,270
write up what happens in the working

97
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,310
group which is like I don't know there's

98
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,729
a template for it too that you can fill

99
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,650
in and for the rest when comments come

100
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:56,800
back from the is DT only thing you need

101
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,109
to do is make sure that all the comments

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,060
are attended to so you don't have to

103
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:06,190
understand what's in there you only have

104
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:07,509
to know what if there are ten comments

105
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,900
back that ten comments have been

106
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:13,180
responded to so for people who are new

107
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,448
to the IDF a great opportunity to get to

108
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,169
know a lot of people and get introduced

109
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:22,659
to the process of the IDF okay thank you

110
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:29,440

111
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:32,229

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,840

of our process and of course as always

134
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,620

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,340
Barry in the back of the room if you

139
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:36,460
want to say bad things

140
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,380
uh-huh or you can always send a note to

141
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,580
the ISD if you have comments that you

142
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,849
want to make

143
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,349
yeah just to be clear I am NOT up for

144
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:46,000
any non-common appointed position this

145
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:56,020
year so you won't be commenting on me in

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:58,169
any case okay to our next topic on the

147
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,448
agenda exactly existing document status

148
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:05,710
we have one document in the ROC editor

149
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:08,199
queue so that has passed the iesg it's

150
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,549
the fee extension and I believe

151
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:14,169
everything is going well with that then

152
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:18,370
we have two documents in the is

153
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:22,030
evaluation States which is the logging

154
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,580
security extension and we also still

155
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:29,440
have the domain mapping for strict

156
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,930
bundling now that is one that we might

157
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,760
give some attention to because there was

158
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,620
some confusion in the is Gy an

159
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,919
informational document came from this

160
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,919
working group we have some problems

161
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,899
explaining that to the iesg because

162
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,060
usually we do standard strike documents

163
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:53,339
this is of course something that's

164
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:57,040
typically for the Ayana EPP registry

165
00:08:53,339 --> 00:09:00,190
where we allow documentation of any sort

166
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,649
for proprietary or experimental or

167
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:07,600
whatever extensions in any PP normally

168
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:09,279
the process for an informational

169
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,040
document is go to the independent

170
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,540
document screen but this one we reviewed

171
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:19,930
in the working group and thus it has we

172
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:24,310
gave it a tag of being approved as an

173
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:27,750
informational document for for the IANA

174
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:31,119
registry I don't know if anybody has

175
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:34,140
comments on that knows how the process

176
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,750
works I sometimes feel the need

177
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,720
especially when talking to the isg that

178
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,570
they have to repeat how the EPP registry

179
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,360
EDI naep registry has been set up that

180
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:52,970
that way why we want to have any

181
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:56,840
documentation the the initial in

182
00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:00,050
of the EPP IANA register registry was

183
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,090
that we were looking for any extension

184
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,719
that was out there and we wanted to have

185
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:10,760
it documented and we wanted to take that

186
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:14,060
as a sort of basis of looking which ones

187
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,010
we were going to standardize or which we

188
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,040
could standardize and for other people

189
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:21,020
to do to look at extensions that they

190
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,449
might want to go and develop but they're

191
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,870
all already was something that's sort of

192
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,790
looked like it that's different from

193
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,740
other iron registries where you know you

194
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:42,740
just have protocol numbers or anything

195
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:49,400
that is a set as a standard yeah so for

196
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:52,370
the so I see John Kang here in the back

197
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:55,550
and he I have not actually had a chance

198
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,980
to talk to him about this but so the the

199
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,310
action on this document it is sitting

200
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,020
with the isg and Barry will may want to

201
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,030
add on to this here as I get into this

202
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,920
so the idea is there's been some

203
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,170
discussion about it being an

204
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,599
informational document as a working

205
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,569
group product and the suggestion from

206
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,550
the reference here would be to make it

207
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,200
an informational document and have it

208
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,260
come into the independent stream instead

209
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,460
of being a working group product that's

210
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,660
all and so we will be asking John King

211
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,910
I'll talk to you more about it

212
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,069
afterwards hadn't had a chance to catch

213
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,020
up with you on this as we put all this

214
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,390
together but that's the action will go

215
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,910
on this document so that's the way it'll

216
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,100
proceed from this this working group I

217
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,699
think that's it then over to the mic

218
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,170
sorry

219
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,750
yeah this is Barry but that's basically

220
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,150
right the that the issue isn't

221
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,710
completely that it's informational that

222
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,390
would be reasonable for this working

223
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,310
group to put out certain informational

224
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,470
documents but something that appears to

225
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,969
be defining the same kind of thing

226
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:58,310
that's coming out of this working group

227
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:00,470
as proposed standards but this one being

228
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:05,060
informational is what struck the iesg as

229
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:06,830
odd and it will definitely go much more

230
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,599
smoothly if this just goes through the

231
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,640
independence dream so that's definitely

232
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,529
the recommendation just on the other one

233
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,660
to clarify I don't believe that's in

234
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,180
iesg evaluation yet that went through

235
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,040
last call and I need it's the action is

236
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,140
on me right now to make sure everything

237
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:28,490
is ready and I'll put it in is G

238
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:30,230
evaluation Scott Scott Hollenback I

239
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,100
actually have a little bit of experience

240
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,690
with a situation similar to number two

241
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,360
some number of years ago we had this

242
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,209
thing called our RP or the registry

243
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,980
registrar protocol that was used in you

244
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,869
know the network solutions and Verisign

245
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,600
shared registration system prior to the

246
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:50,240
existence of EPP and there was a

247
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,209
suggestion to bring that to the ITF and

248
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,579
standardizing it didn't work out quite

249
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:58,130
that way people didn't want to see our

250
00:12:55,579 --> 00:13:01,040
RP standardized but they did want to see

251
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,180
it documented right and anyway so the

252
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,310
long and short of it is one of the

253
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,649
suggestions was to make it clear that

254
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,170
this is you know an informational thing

255
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:12,380
coming out of NSI and/or Verisign was -

256
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:14,149
in the titles say the NSI registry

257
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,250
registrar protocol which eventually

258
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,079
became of the Verisign register protocol

259
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,850
so one suggestion here consider

260
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,089
modifying the title you know to

261
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,700
something like the CN nick EPP domain

262
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:28,160
mapping extension blah blah blah I I

263
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,660
think that'll make it clear that you

264
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,689
know hey this is where it's coming from

265
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,010
and it helps to explain why this is an

266
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:37,360
informational thing as opposed to

267
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:45,500
something that is on the standard strap

268
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:47,740
just for clear is a document a state

269
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,140
hearse so I mean maybe a lot of years

270
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:53,600
already a lot of years work and this

271
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:59,089
document so every new version I singer

272
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:02,779
is for standard tracker so after working

273
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:07,370
group discussion so this is it just for

274
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:10,730
a few registries mainly the Chinese

275
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:15,529
domain name is really the icing is not

276
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:18,560
all not just for its scenic oscillator

277
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:21,370
ha ha low spec admission as actually is

278
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:25,010
a for many

279
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:29,150
Chinese dominated registry for example

280
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:33,710
in there's a organization called Chinese

281
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:39,110
domain name console consult him a lot of

282
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:42,200
example as HKS Janica mo nica so totally

283
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,660
sure so a lot of Chinese ami registry is

284
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,280
there they all follow we also have a

285
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:53,209
Chinese credit table paper making so it

286
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:56,390
will open they all follow this this

287
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:58,970
document I think there's a few registry

288
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:03,650
not not only for Seneca so because we

289
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:06,200
have all a long long hard workers a lot

290
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,170
of years worker is this working group

291
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:13,100
were so weak I like to continue as a

292
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,709
looking follow the working working

293
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:23,510
working for all document as they follow

294
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:25,550
as the revelation thank you this is

295
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,830
Barry if you want the document published

296
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,990
the best way to do it is through the

297
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:33,650
independent stream the iesg has made

298
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,960
that pretty clear so you can not do that

299
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:42,260
if you want to but it's not likely to

300
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:44,060
get published if you do so so I

301
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,730
understand that you know it's used by

302
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,089
multiple registries but it's not used by

303
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,440
all registries we had of course in

304
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,980
preparation for this draft also a

305
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,190
bundling buff where there could also not

306
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:02,240
be there was also no consensus of what

307
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:04,730
sort of bundling was appropriate and

308
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,090
could fit all and one of the result of

309
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:13,600
that was okay we are going to see if we

310
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:20,960
can get the strict bundling variants

311
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:24,830
documented for EPT so as Singapore for

312
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:30,339
whether we initial discussion we have a

313
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:32,839
lot of maybe pompano means situations so

314
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,430
the working group decides there's are

315
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,100
many

316
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:40,819
annalisa tourism is there the street

317
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,490
puniness great situation and under some

318
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,550
are relaxed for the Pannonian secretion

319
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:50,839
so this this is mainly focus on straight

320
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:56,319
upon the funding funnily registration so

321
00:16:50,839 --> 00:17:00,589
I think maybe it's it's already used by

322
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:04,160
Chinese domain name community or

323
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:08,329
registry or a lot of rituals so in

324
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:13,550
future may also come extent who used by

325
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:15,829
other name asked he names it is okay

326
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,198
beautiful example name away and the name

327
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,300
to is if there is a strict bundling

328
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,420
share a lot of information as soon as

329
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,569
they say all kind they can use this

330
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:33,530
information as this is this document

331
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:36,320
thank you thank you okay

332
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,620
then we move on to documents in working

333
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,200
group last call which are two documents

334
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:45,709
actually it's the data escrow and the

335
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,650
Deanery object mapping documents these

336
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:52,400
could have been outside out of the last

337
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:55,570
call already but there were last-minute

338
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,570
changes that needed to be made to the

339
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:01,100
DNA our object mapping documents and we

340
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,340
put that in this second working group

341
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,590
last call and we didn't get so far we

342
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,020
only got two responses of people saying

343
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:12,199
okay we approve this document in working

344
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:15,110
as call this is not enough folks we

345
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,290
really need people to react also to a

346
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,760
second working with last call and put a

347
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:22,460
comment on the mailing this that you

348
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,020
agree that change is in the second

349
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,670
working with past call or not

350
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,830
substantive or that way are they are

351
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:31,179
okay if we don't get any response to

352
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:36,559
this this is not going to be published

353
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:39,050
so please read it on the mailing list

354
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,550
and state your support so we can move

355
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,550
these documents along to the is she

356
00:18:44,930 --> 00:19:05,720
oh you want to come in - yeah I'm Jim

357
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,560
gold from Verisign I'm the document

358
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,590
shepherd for the registry data escrow

359
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:15,050
specification and in my responsibility

360
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,949
is dot and Shepherd I did a detailed

361
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:22,220
review of the draft and I have some what

362
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:24,890
I feel our editorial changes to the

363
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:28,150
graph but I really want feedback from

364
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,050
the working group to confirm that

365
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,670
specifically and I'm going to post it's

366
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,450
the list by the way I just have some

367
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:38,000
highlights here one item is associated

368
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,950
with since the graph refers to registry

369
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,180
registrar those are ignore see that

370
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:51,470
defines those terms to refer to those

371
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:53,120
that RFC also in the examples as dr.

372
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,600
Shepherd I need to validate the examples

373
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,820
and the issue was is that there's use of

374
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,750
dot dot dot in the example so what I did

375
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:05,689
was I went in and created full examples

376
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:09,220
for each of the concrete types supported

377
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:12,530
by the draft in doing so I found errors

378
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:16,780
in the example and my recommendation was

379
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:22,190
to include those examples in the draft

380
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:27,320
for clarity as I got down to the XML

381
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:31,250
schema I noticed that the XML schema was

382
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:34,100
importing the EPP com XML schema which

383
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,210
in essence created a hard dependency to

384
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,169
the EPP RFC which was was concerning to

385
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,650
me

386
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,960
but then when I dug a little deeper it

387
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,990
wound up where the data type that was

388
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,000
used that use that reference was

389
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,550
actually not being used anywhere within

390
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,590
the draft so in essence was just hanging

391
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,810
out there so my recommendation is and

392
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,389
I'll put this on the list the the data

393
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:02,409
type RR

394
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:03,700
type is not being referenced I don't

395
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:08,170
believe that will have any issue related

396
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:12,910
to removing it and any associated the

397
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:15,670
import of the EP become schema into this

398
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,620
schema so in essence I'll be looking for

399
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,120
the working group to confirm that but my

400
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:23,469
recommendation is to go ahead and remove

401
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:26,949
that and then one final element is

402
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:31,600
associated with supporting different

403
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:34,780
types of deposits so we have a scenario

404
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,370
where for the registries the ICANN

405
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,379
accredited registries we need to provide

406
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:43,659
a let's call Brda that uses the data

407
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:47,860
escrow graphs that's really not data

408
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:50,950
escrow they're really not so we had some

409
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:53,500
discussion me and the document editor to

410
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,140
be able to make the drafts be explicit

411
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,120
related to the fact that this is a

412
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:03,190
different type of deposit it's not

413
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:04,870
needed escrow it's a form of deposit and

414
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,700
so the decision was or the

415
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,070
recommendation was was to not to change

416
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,790
the types to find it in the base draft

417
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:16,300
but actually put into the mapping draft

418
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:19,240
a tag or an indicator the fact that this

419
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:21,520
is for a different purpose so since the

420
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,370
mapping draft is in working group last

421
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:29,110
call I'll be making recommendation to

422
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:36,879
add an element to be explicit and so

423
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:44,139
that's it okay about the the line was

424
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:46,030
that this one oh well yeah well the

425
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,980
concern and you could speak up to it as

426
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:52,780
well is that fact that in changing the

427
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,220
schema or removing and helmet from the

428
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,270
scheme and there's a concern related to

429
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,540
whether or not that would cause any

430
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:01,480
interoperability issues and that if that

431
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,190
were the case we may need to be able to

432
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,310
reach out to a broader set of folks to

433
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:10,770
ensure that in fact is not an impact

434
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:13,470
does that make sense okay so

435
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,360
let me just I'll add to that a lot more

436
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,419
context I guess so Jim Calvin speaking

437
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,360
and not wearing it the chairs had here

438
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,340
these documents have some history and in

439
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,469
fact one of the issues here is that they

440
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,740
are broadly implemented in the gTLD

441
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,529
market uh you know amongst registries

442
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:35,850
and registrar's so the documents have

443
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:38,520
been required of gTLD registries and and

444
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:41,760
some registrar's here since the last

445
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,730
round of new gTLDs so the issue here is

446
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,679
to make sure that whatever we do we

447
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,360
don't change these documents in a way

448
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,960
that creates an interoperability issue

449
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,539
or any or that they remain backwards

450
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,159
compatible so in fact what Jim Ghul was

451
00:23:54,539 --> 00:23:58,379
just talking about with wanting to

452
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,840
change the mapping document dad an

453
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,789
indicator in it he's going to go back

454
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,649
and and think about that the best way to

455
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:08,520
do that so that the document remains

456
00:24:04,649 --> 00:24:09,809
backwards compatible just in case and so

457
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,700
that's just something we're bringing to

458
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:13,260
the attention of this group you know the

459
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,399
reality is we're gonna hear more later

460
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,899
about a joint meeting with with tech ops

461
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:21,209
you know that is sort of our opportunity

462
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:22,709
to get broader exposure of some of our

463
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,960
work with more folks in this industry

464
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,120
and we're gonna see some examples of

465
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,700
work that we're gonna bring from there

466
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,039
to here but that's the context that's

467
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,260
going on here so you know Jim identified

468
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:39,539
some some you know issues that we ought

469
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,908
to clean up and just make stable and and

470
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,590
clean I guess is the right word but do

471
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:46,350
that in a way that doesn't impact

472
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,418
existing implementations as much as

473
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,010
possible so that's the goal and we'll

474
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,529
bring this to the mailing list for one

475
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,240
last look when we got it all settled and

476
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:58,890
have a suggestion for doing all of that

477
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:00,299
thanks Roger Carney confirming both of

478
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:08,549
these documents are going to get revised

479
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:10,460
right right so Jim again get revised but

480
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,960
not in a way that should affect

481
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,520
implementations so yes the version

482
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,740
number on the documents will probably

483
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:22,379
increment but it should not affect

484
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:23,940
anything that anybody does say so so do

485
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,769
I get it right at probably the

486
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,710
data escrow document is also getting a

487
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:31,710
new revision so we need to put it is it

488
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:34,230
substantive enough to make another pass

489
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,539
call after that yes is Jim Dugan

490
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,240
yes I based on the feedback and I'll

491
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:42,269
provide a long list of feedback it will

492
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,970
certainly require an update and based on

493
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:50,429
looking at the mapping draft its most

494
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:53,909
likely would require an update Alex may

495
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:56,220
infer just to clarify so the documents

496
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:57,899
are getting to be revised and the

497
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,700
existing working coop last call on the

498
00:25:57,899 --> 00:26:01,649
two documents will also cover the

499
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,190
revised documents so they're gonna be

500
00:26:01,649 --> 00:26:06,899
revised like next couple of days or or

501
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,990
will they be assert working group last

502
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:11,668
call I'm confused about the timeline

503
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,200
yeah yeah yeah okay so what is it

504
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,120
doesn't mean it doesn't make sense for

505
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,600
me to Institute you to review it on the

506
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,489
way yeah that's all this way that's why

507
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,980
I asked the question no no the India

508
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,490
object mapping that one is in second

509
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,870
worker group last call if there are

510
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:33,690
changes to that documents which are

511
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:36,178
purely editorial then of course it stays

512
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,639
that way but I understand from from

513
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,309
James now that the data escort document

514
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:43,500
is also going through a new revision and

515
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,769
so we are going to place another second

516
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:53,580
work that's all for that one as well

517
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:55,679
so for both documents they will they

518
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,230
will get a a Reb in the version number

519
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,179
right as long as the changes are

520
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:02,370
editorial and they don't affect

521
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,769
interoperability in any way it will not

522
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,570
be another working group last call it is

523
00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:08,909
that revised version taking into account

524
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:10,950
working last call comments that will

525
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:12,659
then go forward and be published but if

526
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,250
there is a technical substantive change

527
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:16,950
then we will have to do a working group

528
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:20,730
last call although hopefully we can make

529
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,289
it relatively short will see correct and

530
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,700
this is Gustavo for the record yes I

531
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:25,679
mean the time frame for these updates

532
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:34,009
shall be in a couple of days so pretty

533
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:34,009
quick okay so that concludes our

534
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:38,679
current document status of at least

535
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,490
anything that's we're not working on

536
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,440
anymore for an overview this is our

537
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,149
milestone review of the milestones that

538
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,830
we are supposed to be doing or have done

539
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:55,000
you'll see a lot of the lot of them

540
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:59,830
already done we move on to the existing

541
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,049
work now and we have Mario's going to

542
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:09,539
present something wrong the the art of

543
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:09,539
documents so let me put your slides up

544
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:20,049
yeah

545
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:22,470
this what I thought does it I don't know

546
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,470
it's this one

547
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:40,930
which ones even start with okay hello

548
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:46,620
everybody I am Mari Alfredo from dirty

549
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:46,620
registry just a couple of slides to

550
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:57,850
partial response to summarize most

551
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:03,750
significant changes made on the

552
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:08,139
documents since the last meeting lots of

553
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:12,550
these changes resulted from the feedback

554
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:15,490
provided by Tamera zone thank you Tom

555
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:19,260
for your standard review it was very

556
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:23,730
very appreciated let's start with the

557
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:28,809
draft about partial response in in adapt

558
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:32,260
businesslike to version have been

559
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:36,220
published since last meeting in version

560
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:39,550
0-3 a diversion zerotree added the a

561
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,370
unique own name field in the IDF you set

562
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:50,250
when returned a domain or name server is

563
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:50,250
an ibn and last the currently activation

564
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:57,309
contains a recommendation for the other

565
00:29:53,650 --> 00:30:00,990
providers to include self link in any

566
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:08,230
field set different from the fulfil set

567
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:12,000
this is to allow to allow the end user

568
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:18,070
to request for additional information

569
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:24,880
then then those then the providing

570
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:32,040
information we can now move to sorting

571
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,040
and paging draft

572
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:47,330
okay next try the next slide please

573
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:52,669
in this case free version have been plug

574
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:56,649
published since July in the the

575
00:30:52,669 --> 00:31:00,250
bathrooms zero for replaced the LDH name

576
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:04,518
we named among the sorting properties

577
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:08,299
the name certain property is mapped onto

578
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:14,659
the combination of LDH name and único

579
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:18,908
name this is because in enid up there

580
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:26,179
exists two different elements different

581
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:28,399
views of the same data and the this data

582
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:32,269
is mapped on the same underlying

583
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,758
database field the unicorn name value

584
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,830
must be taken while sorting when the

585
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:41,230
unique own name is missing the value of

586
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:45,649
l LDH name must be considered instead

587
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:48,200
this dispersion fatherly kind of

588
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:50,809
clarified the certain logic we respected

589
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:55,309
the json value types and the sorting

590
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:59,149
policy for multivalued fields in brief

591
00:31:55,309 --> 00:32:02,090
this means that the JS of strings must

592
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:04,340
be sorted according to the left

593
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,689
less psychographic order and JSON

594
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:11,178
numbers must be sorted according to

595
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:18,139
lessen the numerical order with the only

596
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:23,000
exception of IP addresses which better

597
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:26,269
clarified the inversion z05 the j card

598
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,490
so test parameters must be ignored for

599
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:32,149
the purpose of this sorting capability

600
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:35,419
and when more than one value is retarded

601
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:38,439
the sorting will be applied to the value

602
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:42,020
identified by a preference information

603
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:46,890
it could be for example the

604
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:48,720
parameter jacquard parameter if a

605
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:51,240
preference information is missing the

606
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,790
sorting will be applied to the to the

607
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,620
first value of the collection the 0-5

608
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:02,010
version clarified the certain logic on

609
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,500
IP addresses IP addresses must be sorted

610
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:11,420
based on the numeric conversion rather

611
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:15,630
than they they be JSON string the value

612
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:18,090
it clarified as well the mapping between

613
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:21,480
the certain properties and the other

614
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:24,860
fields each other provider may define

615
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:28,080
other certain probabilities than those

616
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:32,070
providing this document as well as it

617
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,610
may map those sorting properties on

618
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:39,230
different location for example due to a

619
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:44,040
different presentation of the contact

620
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:50,570
representation this is the subject of my

621
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:54,629
next presentation here in this session

622
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:57,899
the currently active version renamed the

623
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:01,770
pitch count property of paging metadata

624
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:05,070
element to page sides and under the a a

625
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:08,790
new a new property in page metadata

626
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:12,060
elemental called the page number even if

627
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:14,940
page size and page number seems to be

628
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:20,940
redundant for clients because they can

629
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:23,970
be derived by code they can avoid the

630
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,880
and end the user interactive by a

631
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:29,419
browser to feel disorientate in the in

632
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,420
the result set

633
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:44,250
finally we have the no sorry I forgot

634
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:46,890
there is another important thing to

635
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,500
evaluate for next version is how to

636
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:52,580
implement vaccination when links can be

637
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,800
used for example this is the case of the

638
00:34:52,580 --> 00:35:01,200
request submitted

639
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:06,630
via HTTP POST currently this is not

640
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,600
allowed in the inaudible but it could be

641
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:14,610
in the future if we work for example

642
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:18,509
submit complex query including lots of

643
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:21,990
predicates joining the by boolean

644
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:23,850
operators the current structure

645
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:27,060
parameter and element that element

646
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:31,770
doesn't support this case a solution

647
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:34,820
could be for example to add an optional

648
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:39,380
property name in the next car so that

649
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:47,750
could be used in place on links when the

650
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:47,750
the request is is made by an HTTP POST

651
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,170
last draft

652
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:25,740
not yet but well the most significant

653
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:29,730
change is made on the draft about

654
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:40,618
research is the refactoring of the query

655
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:46,529
model the query model was made more was

656
00:36:40,619 --> 00:37:02,180
made simpler the query string URLs error

657
00:36:46,529 --> 00:37:02,180
safe and I try to entertain you

658
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:28,360
and the and the curry method and the

659
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:32,290
curry model was made more generic this

660
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:37,690
is named new format for submit a reverse

661
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:40,180
search query the resource type must be

662
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:47,040
one of their sous type path segments

663
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:52,120
defined in section 3.2 of RFC 75 -

664
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:55,960
currently the possible values for

665
00:37:52,120 --> 00:38:01,450
results type is domains then server or

666
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:04,720
entities but maybe in the future it

667
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:09,339
could be they could be a piece or out

668
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:14,470
gnomes if we think that entities are in

669
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:19,000
relationship with any other object in

670
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:22,629
adapt role must be one of the rules

671
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:27,310
described in section ten point two point

672
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:30,100
four or elf c74 a tree for role

673
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:33,490
independent searches the value entity

674
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:37,270
generic value entity must be used and

675
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,459
property is the entity property to be

676
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:43,020
used in matching the search pattern a

677
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:46,240
predefined list of properties includes

678
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:49,720
format name and only mail city country

679
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,939
and country code obviously the service

680
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:57,250
may implement additional properties to

681
00:38:51,940 --> 00:39:01,750
those define it last slide is about the

682
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:04,360
a comparison between the previous way to

683
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:08,430
submit such a query and they are Twala

684
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:14,110
the current way to submit a search query

685
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:18,060
to highlight that the new format is

686
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,060
simple than the previous one

687
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,500
Alex may have a quick comment yes I

688
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,780
agree to that

689
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:33,090
I appreciate the new format as well much

690
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:38,110
easier much more natural okay thank you

691
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:41,440
thank you - that wasn't last night right

692
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:47,680
yeah okay anybody any other questions

693
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:50,860
for the past three documents though what

694
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,359
we have a question Mario yeah what do

695
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,470
you think the current status of these

696
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:59,140
three tokens is of course when I look at

697
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,490
the milestones yes they were about to be

698
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:05,350
published but I don't know how many

699
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:07,450
still - that mm the current status of

700
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,700
this document depends on the

701
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:19,029
implementation real implementation I

702
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:23,430
note that there are some in this room is

703
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:26,050
going to implement one or one or two

704
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:30,399
capabilities of these documents another

705
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:34,420
for example - marason is trying to

706
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,900
implement is is implementing the

707
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:43,780
probably the research on EPS or

708
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:47,830
afternoons in implementing the the

709
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:53,740
sorting capabilities in in his add up

710
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:58,200
server I I don't know I know that there

711
00:40:53,740 --> 00:41:02,979
are some implementation about the paging

712
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:07,210
made by Google even if they are a bit

713
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:11,890
different from the the one providing

714
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:16,090
this document because the the the PG

715
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:19,150
link is provided as part of a notice and

716
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:22,360
not a part of the pudgy metadata section

717
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:28,800
but I am in contact with the Google guys

718
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:31,940
to collaborate - - to invite them to

719
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:36,810
implement these

720
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:42,650
this solution in the in the ended up

721
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:46,759
service currently I don't know any other

722
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:50,850
implementation about these documents

723
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:54,930
obviously in addition to the ite at the

724
00:41:50,850 --> 00:42:01,319
server if there is if there are any

725
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:05,970
other implementation I am happy to to to

726
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:14,160
contribute to help anyone who is willing

727
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:16,680
to implement these solutions Tom

728
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,290
Harrison ethnic I just had one comment

729
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,600
on the reverse search document the

730
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,190
sorting and paging document appears to

731
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,890
allow or does allow our customizable

732
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:27,330
mapping of the of the field whereas the

733
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,629
reverse search document appears to be

734
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:32,250
quite prescriptive about what fields

735
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,870
have to be used for the reverse search I

736
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,960
think it's I think your intent is to

737
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:39,540
allow that to be service specific for

738
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,940
reverse search as well so I think it's

739
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,980
just a terminology thing in the job just

740
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:51,450
to clarify that service can do what they

741
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:54,570
want with the reverse search yes Alex

742
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:57,299
meal for anecdote a key just as a heads

743
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:59,340
up we might start looking into

744
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,810
implementing an art at servant early

745
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:07,080
2020 so we might not have time this year

746
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:08,310
to start working on it but but it's

747
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,220
definitely going to happen in the first

748
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:15,480
quarter of next year so it's probably

749
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:22,020
too late for the documents but this is a

750
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:26,520
heads up so and I think that we must

751
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:28,759
have more time to evaluate these

752
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:33,259
documents because for example in the

753
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:38,760
final report for add a pilot project

754
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:42,270
state that most of for most of the

755
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:45,799
submitted queries are lookup queries

756
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:50,900
rather than search queries so

757
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:57,290
I think that now they are top

758
00:43:50,900 --> 00:44:02,930
implementers are knowing adapt better so

759
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:07,220
they can evaluate the if if this

760
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:10,160
solution can contribute to make the they

761
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:13,069
are top service more efficient so

762
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,629
because it depends on the obviously on

763
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:21,349
the service provided by the other

764
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:26,000
service so if the most of the current

765
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:32,900
are top implementation provided only the

766
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:36,650
lookup queries we must have more time to

767
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,930
to evaluate this document so what is

768
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:43,730
saying the timelines momentarily on the

769
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:46,279
milestone list they cannot be met should

770
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:49,730
we take one or two off the milestone

771
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:53,150
list for the moment so that we can

772
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:58,510
attend to other work that we want to do

773
00:44:53,150 --> 00:45:00,920
in our lab really I don't know because I

774
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:07,730
can't imagine a decision at this

775
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:11,960
scenario from now probably maybe there

776
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:13,880
are some new other service

777
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:18,380
implementation try to implement search

778
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:24,619
queries in efficient way so probably

779
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:30,500
they have to to to implement sorting and

780
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:32,960
paging and if and partial response if

781
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:36,770
they want to make they implementation

782
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:41,809
more efficient but reverse search is

783
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:46,190
another is a different situation because

784
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:51,190
it depends on the service that they

785
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:56,359
adopt servic want to provide to the

786
00:45:51,190 --> 00:46:00,710
end-user or register I don't know

787
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:03,609
for example we annoy dot dot ID we want

788
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:06,980
to provide our register to with the

789
00:46:03,609 --> 00:46:10,339
capability to reverse search on their

790
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:16,359
own domains I don't know if the this is

791
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:21,828
the strategy of other registries

792
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:27,460
I repeat this from we regard to the

793
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:37,069
river search this dissolution was not

794
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:43,450
for to to be open to everyone we add dot

795
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:48,549
ID we have strong strict rules about the

796
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:56,169
provide the dissemination of personal

797
00:46:48,549 --> 00:47:01,819
information so we are firstly involving

798
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:05,989
under the GDP air rules so we want to

799
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:08,288
provide these capabilities mainly to our

800
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:13,089
registrants

801
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:13,089
because we we receive a lot of

802
00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:22,700
out-of-band

803
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:30,349
requests regarding research regarding

804
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:35,470
the list of domains matching some such

805
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:35,470
conditions such patterns now we are

806
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:44,299
before now we are we we provide this

807
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:50,450
service as a out-of-band solution we

808
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:57,400
want to integrate this request in India

809
00:47:50,450 --> 00:48:02,180
top server so we are not required to to

810
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:07,430
give an answer in an out-of-band by a

811
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:09,020
not own band mechanism oh this is a

812
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:12,529
little

813
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:15,589
yes she started talking about the

814
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:17,780
privacy stuff and I remember that last

815
00:48:15,589 --> 00:48:19,069
year and we had somewhat intense

816
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,380
discussions around it

817
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:24,680
and so I'm and I see that you did

818
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:28,640
updates to the document yes part two so

819
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:32,808
I wanted to you to elaborate on your

820
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:35,779
update but according to the privacy

821
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:40,150
consideration you mean privacy

822
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,150
considerations and yes I have already

823
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:51,470
stayed in the document that obviously

824
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:53,480
this we regard to the worst research the

825
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:56,480
research capabilities capabilities must

826
00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:00,589
must be must be provide I repeat the

827
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:07,240
master provider according the national

828
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:12,339
rules or any other rules about the

829
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,339
provisioning of personal information so

830
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:22,730
in the if we if I look to the

831
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:28,118
implementation the dotted implementation

832
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:30,799
that we we want to provide this

833
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:34,369
discovery to our registers they are

834
00:49:30,799 --> 00:49:36,890
legitimated to to see the personal

835
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:39,230
information of their own contacts not

836
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:43,779
the info personal information of other

837
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:49,270
register console contacts obviously and

838
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:59,450
this is the the principle aspiring this

839
00:49:49,270 --> 00:50:04,509
dissolution the new query model allows

840
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:09,379
the other service to provide the

841
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:15,829
researcher the research in according to

842
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:18,049
and authorization according to a

843
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:21,890
naturalization implementation based on

844
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:22,550
our payroll basis so for example you can

845
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:26,270
protect

846
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:29,120
more registrant reversal register that

847
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:35,180
reverse search on technical contacts for

848
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:40,009
example this was not foreseen in the in

849
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:45,700
the in the previous version but I repeat

850
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:45,700
this I don't know if we are the

851
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:54,700
isolating this in we are the only one

852
00:50:50,240 --> 00:51:00,410
thinking that there are the need of this

853
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:04,129
dissolution because we we are we we are

854
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:10,000
we receive a lot of records asking for

855
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:10,000
the same some information which is the

856
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:17,420
the number of domains related to this

857
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:19,760
technical contact Oh what are they don't

858
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,770
make which which are the domains related

859
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,040
to this technique contact which are the

860
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:29,390
domains related to this registrant but

861
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:32,270
from our registrants obviously yeah so I

862
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:35,120
don't think that the need for the River

863
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:38,390
searches in question I think that in

864
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:42,080
question is the the wording of the

865
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:44,750
privacy implications because right now

866
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:50,509
it says oh you should follow the law and

867
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:53,300
I mean that is basically to always it's

868
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:53,810
like you know that's just stating the

869
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,060
obvious

870
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:59,630
I think the privacy considerations

871
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:05,690
really would do well in describing what

872
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:07,460
the problem is and probably giving some

873
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:12,020
guidance in what implementers should

874
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:14,900
look at and what they should do just

875
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:19,130
saying follow the law is really not that

876
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:21,530
helpful so so I don't know I want to

877
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:23,810
support I'm sorry I want to jump in here

878
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,760
as chair and say that I don't want to

879
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:28,509
fall into the discussion all the privacy

880
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,340
discussion we had last time it is true

881
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,990
actually I do share your concern to what

882
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:34,430
you're saying about the privacy

883
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:36,220
considerations as written but let me

884
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:38,919
suggest that we take that to the list

885
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:41,500
- look update that that side of things

886
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,790
want to give Alex a chance here to have

887
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,920
a last word and then I want to drive

888
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:49,779
towards a milestone discussion yes

889
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:53,619
thanks Alex me over Victoria T just a

890
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:55,390
processing very quickly in order to

891
00:52:53,619 --> 00:52:57,599
solve like the math on problem that we

892
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:00,879
mentioned before

893
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,040
do we have any feeling that any of those

894
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,530
three documents is more advanced than

895
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,930
the others more stable yet the other and

896
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:09,700
so on and so you can try to get that one

897
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,919
off the list of the milestones as fast

898
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:13,750
as possible even though if we haven't

899
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,819
like hundred implementations for it yet

900
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:19,839
but we have a good gut feeling all right

901
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:24,880
and I must call it yeah I think my

902
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:32,220
opinion is that sorting and paging and

903
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:32,220
partial response mmm don't need more

904
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:46,630
updates as far as I know it is they seem

905
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,549
to me quite comprehensive so I I don't

906
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:53,740
know so the only wait for implementation

907
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:56,380
that's what you say sorry so they are

908
00:53:53,740 --> 00:54:00,040
only waiting for more yeah more

909
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:01,540
implementation so but but still I mean

910
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:06,609
you have done an implementation of that

911
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:12,009
obviously I suppose yes so maybe it

912
00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:13,540
would be a good idea to find out if

913
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:15,430
there are other implementations for that

914
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:16,240
yeah find out whether they are

915
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:19,299
compatible

916
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:23,799
yes interoperable I would say between

917
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:25,810
science and service and also like people

918
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,910
like me yeah who like looking into

919
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:31,859
implementing that that they would maybe

920
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:34,899
try to do a sort of review on that and

921
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:36,750
and at least any potential

922
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:39,040
implementation issues they would have

923
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:41,440
and after that we could pray really like

924
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,240
working through blast call it yeah III

925
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,609
don't remember - you have implementation

926
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:49,379
status section in the document yes

927
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:52,739
perfect good so maybe up that date

928
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:55,319
update that and and and get after that

929
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:59,460
last call those two document but go for

930
00:54:55,319 --> 00:55:02,579
it basically name element did this

931
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:05,369
document provide solution well-known

932
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:13,380
solution in other rest services so I

933
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:16,880
mean the topic is are quite clear to me

934
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,880
[Music]

935
00:55:17,809 --> 00:55:25,140
the basic idea is to deal with huge

936
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:29,069
result sets for example so I don't know

937
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:35,460
if you want to provide large result set

938
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:38,910
in in your implementation in a efficient

939
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:46,680
way because obviously you can provide

940
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:49,470
domain searches returning quite always a

941
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,029
truncated the result set but in my

942
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:54,598
opinion this is not an efficient

943
00:55:51,029 --> 00:55:58,349
solution for example donuts that's let's

944
00:55:54,599 --> 00:56:01,440
look at those one final last call and

945
00:55:58,349 --> 00:56:03,299
then I mean yeah so for you guys I'm

946
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,229
just proposing a way to get them yeah

947
00:56:03,299 --> 00:56:10,288
off the Mansell's

948
00:56:04,229 --> 00:56:13,979
yes I'll be very brief Rick Wilhelm it

949
00:56:10,289 --> 00:56:16,289
listening this it strikes me that not

950
00:56:13,979 --> 00:56:18,779
just server implementations are helpful

951
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:21,779
but also client-side implementation yeah

952
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:23,849
helpful in the and speaking to things

953
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:26,519
that offer example one in the are tab

954
00:56:23,849 --> 00:56:28,680
pilot working group back over the summer

955
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:30,299
mark lon mark blonde Shay's work on the

956
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,569
client-side was instrumental in driving

957
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:34,739
a lot of clarity and then I'll note the

958
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:36,690
and I admit that I haven't been

959
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:39,749
following this this closely but from

960
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:42,089
what you said and Tom Harrison's work

961
00:56:39,749 --> 00:56:43,919
was instrumental in helping to flush out

962
00:56:42,089 --> 00:56:45,630
other problems I think it's not just

963
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,819
server implementations like alex is

964
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:50,130
noting but also client implementations

965
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:52,859
that would be useful in drugs trying to

966
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:59,359
drive out some eggs I think that most of

967
00:56:52,859 --> 00:57:03,180
you know my up my personal opinion about

968
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:08,190
how to implement an app

969
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:11,660
and I thought I think we are thinking

970
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:17,040
about a self configurable

971
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:18,839
self-configuring client based on the

972
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:25,740
service specification provide by the

973
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:33,058
others so this is my opinion so probably

974
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:39,169
next year will will be we release a nod

975
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:42,150
up client based on these basic idea ok

976
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:44,130
thank you Mario so thank you you got the

977
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:45,839
response no we are trying to move these

978
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:47,970
documents forward get lost a milestone

979
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,480
list and if anything is be done please

980
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,319
do it

981
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:54,599
got another list I do tournament misery

982
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:56,460
ok next presentation existing work and

983
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:01,970
this is actually something that is not

984
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:05,700
on our milestones list but it came back

985
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:07,618
Gustavo so if you could please also put

986
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:11,220
a little history on status of this

987
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:12,650
document please sure just awaken next

988
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:16,709
slide please

989
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:21,109
so this is a really old draft it was

990
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:23,910
polishing 2013 and this draft describes

991
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:26,549
the services that are provided by the

992
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:29,730
tmdb which is the tremor database

993
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:32,579
something that was created for the icon

994
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:34,680
tremor clean house and registries and

995
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:37,700
registers use these drugs to implement

996
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:40,379
the integrations with those services

997
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:42,930
when the first version was published we

998
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:45,240
already had like several conversations

999
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:47,629
with trace trees and registers regarding

1000
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:51,118
this so the first version was quite

1001
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:56,910
mature and stable there were no major

1002
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:58,859
changes since May 2014 the intended

1003
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:00,180
status of this graph is informational I

1004
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:03,299
don't know if that's going to be an

1005
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:05,819
issue with the going this being and

1006
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:07,680
working or working group document or we

1007
00:59:05,819 --> 00:59:09,779
need to go to independent independent

1008
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,899
tracks and I mean that's that's a good

1009
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:14,700
question right as I mentioned before

1010
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,290
this draft has been implemented by

1011
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:19,020
registries registrar's

1012
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:26,640
and Clearing House in the case of the GT

1013
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:28,920
Li space looks like this back in 2016

1014
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,900
the idea was to push these as I never

1015
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:35,730
seen the draft was adopted by the EPP

1016
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:38,670
extension working group which is the

1017
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:43,410
working group that precedes this working

1018
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:46,440
group on the last phase of the draft we

1019
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:48,390
received some comments from Patrick and

1020
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:51,390
based on those comments

1021
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:54,870
we had several well we had meetings with

1022
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:57,509
Patrick and we modified that document

1023
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,430
that is there that document I can

1024
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,810
document it's not related to this draft

1025
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:02,730
well it's linked from this graph but

1026
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:05,070
it's not like like a normative reference

1027
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:08,400
but I don't remember so but the end of

1028
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:09,870
the day we modified that document we

1029
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,570
verified some things within the

1030
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:13,109
Clearinghouse and everything work out so

1031
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:16,440
we're good

1032
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:18,720
the Nexus lied to the best of my

1033
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,790
knowledge there are not pending action

1034
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,450
items on this draft it should be fairly

1035
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:27,090
easy to publish it as another scene as I

1036
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:29,899
mention before this is really mature I

1037
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:32,700
mean it has been in operation for years

1038
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:34,770
in the case of the utility space and

1039
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:38,490
utility program its use I mean

1040
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:41,490
everywhere this draft is linked from

1041
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:44,609
several legal contracts so we really

1042
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:47,100
want to have unstable reference because

1043
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:48,780
it has been expired for some time in the

1044
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:51,600
past and needs may be not a good idea to

1045
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:55,710
have an expired draft link from a legal

1046
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:57,240
contract Nexus light and that's it I

1047
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:02,580
mean I don't know if you have any

1048
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:07,259
questions over the answered questions

1049
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:11,220
and we have a questions okay so um Jim

1050
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:13,800
Galvin not wearing a chair hat so this

1051
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,799
this document like the data escrow

1052
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:20,250
documents has a fair amount of history

1053
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:24,600
in existence so it also has fairly broad

1054
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:26,310
deployment but documenting it was in an

1055
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,130
issue because from a technical point of

1056
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:29,880
view it was just missing the ICANN side

1057
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,220
who was missing

1058
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,720
the policy side of it what it needed to

1059
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:36,240
look like and some we needed some

1060
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:40,589
changes on that side in order for this

1061
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:42,569
document to be considered stable so what

1062
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:45,030
we need actually still at this point is

1063
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:46,500
the one objection was from Patrick false

1064
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:50,370
term way back when you you had the

1065
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:52,290
reference in here we would we're gonna

1066
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:55,650
seek just to make sure that Patrick

1067
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:57,450
wants to relieve his his objection that

1068
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:59,130
all of that has been satisfied and in

1069
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:01,259
this document like the escrow documents

1070
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:02,640
again well this is actually in better

1071
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,070
shape because there's been no changes to

1072
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:06,750
the document it's just that it now has a

1073
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:09,020
context in which to live which is

1074
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:12,090
accurate and correct and functioning

1075
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:15,450
with the matching rules defined by by

1076
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:17,400
ICANN so we'll be able to release this

1077
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:20,189
document and do a working group last

1078
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:22,290
call and move it along as long as

1079
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:25,560
there's no objections we need that one

1080
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:28,560
objection from from Patrick to be just

1081
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:30,930
just to be bold back I guess is the

1082
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:35,430
phrase for it but notice anyone else has

1083
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:39,240
any questions or comments it's about the

1084
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:40,919
matching rules yeah that so in in his

1085
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,919
slides you'll see in his slides he has a

1086
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:47,010
reference to you know the update that is

1087
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:50,490
now present on the ICANN side that fixes

1088
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:52,470
the conflict Jim rates just a quick

1089
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:54,180
question for clarification are you going

1090
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:56,640
to publish this plan to publish an

1091
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,190
informational RFC or we going to have

1092
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,890
potential feedback a push back again

1093
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:04,830
from the iesg and then pass after the

1094
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:07,500
individual submission path I'm not

1095
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:09,120
expecting any pushback on this one it

1096
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:12,810
should be an informational document and

1097
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:17,100
I expect that it would be okay or to go

1098
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:18,600
through as a working group document work

1099
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,759
product but Barry's up there let him

1100
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,740
speak to that yeah this is Barry I can't

1101
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:26,310
speak for the is G as a whole and who

1102
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:28,470
knows what some ad will question but as

1103
01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:30,630
I said before it is reasonable for this

1104
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:32,250
working group to put out informational

1105
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:38,789
specs when it makes sense for them to be

1106
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:41,910
informational okay

1107
01:03:38,789 --> 01:03:41,910
thank you

1108
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:15,480
so you wanted to have this put up Jim

1109
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:17,460
because so thank you just going back to

1110
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,560
this particular slide that was there and

1111
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:21,360
just to recap what I think are some

1112
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,400
actions coming out of this group as we

1113
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,170
look at our milestone list and before we

1114
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:28,160
get to talking about new work and

1115
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:31,800
jumping into the to the next thing here

1116
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:33,720
we had in August we had two milestones

1117
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:35,400
for the day to escrow documents I think

1118
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,689
that we'll leave those milestones alone

1119
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,240
for the moment because those documents

1120
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:41,010
are just about ready to be where they're

1121
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,799
at the tail end of their working group

1122
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:47,640
last call to be submitted to the isg so

1123
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:49,920
at least you know the chair suggestion

1124
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,509
here would be that we not change the

1125
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,880
milestone date or anything at the moment

1126
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:55,350
we'll just let them progress since

1127
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:57,200
they're in theory going to be pushed out

1128
01:04:55,350 --> 01:05:01,470
soon and that should be fine

1129
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:04,290
with respect to our gap we had September

1130
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:06,240
October November deadlines for partial

1131
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:10,560
responses sorting and paging and then

1132
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:14,399
reverse search I I believe what I heard

1133
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:16,230
from Mario is that he believes that the

1134
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,540
partial response and the sorting and

1135
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:24,680
purging of purging sorry about that

1136
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:28,860
partial response and sorting in Beijing

1137
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:32,009
documents are you know stable from his

1138
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:35,010
point of view which suggests that the

1139
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:36,360
next obvious step for them is is to

1140
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:38,520
consider whether or not they're ready

1141
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,620
for publication we do have an issue

1142
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,700
about implementation and how much

1143
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:43,650
further we want to push on

1144
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:47,009
implementation before the working group

1145
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:50,160
agrees for them to go forward so I'm

1146
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:52,680
thinking that one way to to force that

1147
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:54,930
question is to suggest that we we move

1148
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,460
those into working group last call so

1149
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:59,129
that we can have people comment

1150
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,840
explicitly that they don't want them to

1151
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:03,120
go forward without a particular action

1152
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,590
I'm thinking that we just want to find a

1153
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,690
way to force the working group to

1154
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:08,160
respond and and and react to these

1155
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:09,990
documents and then if there are

1156
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,330
implementation concerns people can speak

1157
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,589
to that and then we can you know decide

1158
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:15,690
at the end of that that we're going to

1159
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:17,849
wait for another period and do that

1160
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:20,310
um I would like to suggest that we

1161
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:22,440
actually put those two into working

1162
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:25,020
group last call and we'll see how that

1163
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,430
plays out if it ends up that we want to

1164
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,650
hold them back because we want more

1165
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:30,540
implementation experience then we'll

1166
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:32,280
have to turn that into updating the

1167
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:35,369
milestones with respect to those two

1168
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,829
documents and one option might be that

1169
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:40,020
we not actually have a milestone for

1170
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:41,849
them okay and you'll see why that might

1171
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:45,210
be relevant as we get into new work and

1172
01:06:41,849 --> 01:06:46,740
we start moving forward or we might just

1173
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:48,869
update the milestones but we can make

1174
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,399
that decision later so a working group

1175
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:52,079
last call for those two documents

1176
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,720
following this IEF is where we'll go

1177
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,640
with those the reverse searching

1178
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,899
document I get the sense that there's

1179
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,400
still work to be done there we don't

1180
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:02,849
think that that is as stable as the

1181
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:06,950
other two so what we need to think about

1182
01:07:02,849 --> 01:07:11,099
here is what to move the milestone to

1183
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:13,169
since it really was due now and I don't

1184
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:14,640
know if Mary oh if you want to say

1185
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:17,089
anything about that now or we can take

1186
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,078
that to the list we can just see wick

1187
01:07:17,089 --> 01:07:21,390
listening to my co-chair here saying

1188
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:23,220
let's just take it to the list we should

1189
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:26,279
make a decision about how far we want to

1190
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:28,529
push out the milestone for that so we'll

1191
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:30,329
try to pass that message on to the

1192
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:31,800
working group and people can take some

1193
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:34,950
time to think about what they want to do

1194
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:37,619
there okay open ID we'll just leave a

1195
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:39,540
loan for right now although maybe I

1196
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:40,650
don't know Scott if you want to say

1197
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,420
anything about it or not you don't have

1198
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:44,819
to feel obligated to but you're standing

1199
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,859
up so please go ahead sure Scott home

1200
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:48,390
back with respect to this document I

1201
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:51,119
think the protocol piece is actually

1202
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:54,990
pretty solid it hasn't changed much in

1203
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:57,119
the last year or so and in fact you know

1204
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:58,439
the different machination zuv people who

1205
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,569
have looked at it like in the IKEA

1206
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,040
context in particular you know while

1207
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:03,390
they move the bits and pieces around

1208
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,579
they're still basically using the same

1209
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:07,920
protocol and so I feel pretty confident

1210
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:10,290
about that I am much less confident in

1211
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,020
whether or not I got the Ayana registry

1212
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:15,390
bits correct you may recall there's a

1213
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:18,238
section in there we come registering

1214
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:20,549
ooofff claims you know that are used to

1215
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,799
help document attributes of appropriate

1216
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:24,689
identities and there's a lot of

1217
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:27,299
dependence there on what comes out of I

1218
01:08:24,689 --> 01:08:29,399
cans you know expedited policy

1219
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:32,969
development process you know

1220
01:08:29,399 --> 01:08:34,290
for anyway lots of acronyms there I I

1221
01:08:32,969 --> 01:08:37,408
think it's something we have to make a

1222
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:40,350
call I could pull out the Ayana registry

1223
01:08:37,408 --> 01:08:43,189
bits and just say hey look when I can

1224
01:08:40,350 --> 01:08:46,199
get to texting acts act together there

1225
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:47,759
those claims can be registered you know

1226
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:49,710
and then the protocol piece progresses

1227
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,109
independently or we just hold on a

1228
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:54,359
little bit longer and try to capture the

1229
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:57,210
bits we know will be necessary you know

1230
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:58,560
to meet ICANN's needs and I guess I'm

1231
01:08:57,210 --> 01:09:00,658
kind of leaning towards let's just hold

1232
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,699
on a little bit they seem to be making

1233
01:09:00,658 --> 01:09:04,080
progress and you know who knows six

1234
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:08,370
months from now they may actually have

1235
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:11,040
some outputs so thank you for that I

1236
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:13,500
mean speaking for myself I am inclined

1237
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,719
to not make a milestone change at the

1238
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,640
moment I mean on the ICANN side there's

1239
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,698
a certain expectation of something to

1240
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:23,279
appear relatively soon that the our deaf

1241
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:24,960
working group on that side can actually

1242
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:26,250
do something with and we'll have a

1243
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,140
better sense by the time we get around

1244
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:30,689
to the next ITF meeting what we want to

1245
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:34,109
do with this document we may actually be

1246
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:35,639
working on it by then or or not but in

1247
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:37,609
any case we'll have some data with which

1248
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:43,580
to decide what to do about the milestone

1249
01:09:37,609 --> 01:09:47,819
so okay with that back to you yes okay

1250
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:49,408
so we were looking at the milestones of

1251
01:09:47,819 --> 01:09:51,600
course because the next topic on our

1252
01:09:49,408 --> 01:09:55,159
agenda is a report or tutoring I can

1253
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,830
take of interim rejects meeting and

1254
01:09:55,159 --> 01:10:00,719
based on that we're going to have a look

1255
01:09:58,830 --> 01:10:06,860
at our milestone list to see what we

1256
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:19,170
want on there so let me just put the

1257
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:26,009
slides up and Jim is going to present on

1258
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:29,610
this chair head of okay so this is me

1259
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:33,030
presenting as myself not as co-chair

1260
01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:35,519
here but go to the next slide so we did

1261
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:37,170
something new and interesting that we've

1262
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,870
sort of mentioned this a few times here

1263
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:41,820
but let's try to be very clear and

1264
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:43,590
specific here about the relationship

1265
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,420
what was going on

1266
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:49,850
the tech ops is a Technical Operations

1267
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:52,080
Group in in ICANN and it is comprised of

1268
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:54,900
essentially technical representation

1269
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:57,630
from registries and registrar's on the

1270
01:10:54,900 --> 01:11:00,089
gTLD side and there's quite a lot of

1271
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:01,830
them in there and you know obviously

1272
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:04,290
many more of them than err that are here

1273
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:06,030
for whatever reason you know it just

1274
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:08,310
turns out that I can it's just the place

1275
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:10,349
where you get a lot of registrar's in

1276
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:13,140
particular and certainly more registries

1277
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,820
than than we have here in this room to

1278
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:17,010
participate so it's an ideal place to

1279
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:20,280
have and make sure that we get exposure

1280
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:24,390
of particular you know technical details

1281
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:27,179
about registries and registrar's so we

1282
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:29,250
did something new this time which was to

1283
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:31,560
have an interim eating for regex but we

1284
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:33,330
made a joint with the tech ops group at

1285
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:35,640
the last ICANN meeting which in fact was

1286
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:38,340
two weeks ago in Montreal and I had put

1287
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,620
this same slide up there at the

1288
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:43,200
beginning of that meeting as a way of

1289
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:45,269
introducing the IETF relationship to

1290
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,550
them and so the slide is here as a way

1291
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:49,410
of introducing the ICANN relationship to

1292
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,480
the ITF so that everyone is sort of on

1293
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:55,230
the same page as to to what's going on

1294
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:59,040
here in particular there are 14

1295
01:11:55,230 --> 01:12:02,309
potential documents to you know ask for

1296
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,780
the working group to adopt and then push

1297
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:06,090
them through on the registry

1298
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:08,910
registration services side of the work

1299
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:10,680
stream here and you know that would then

1300
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:12,630
create a set of milestones for this

1301
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:15,690
group to work with and you know folks

1302
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:17,280
from that side we we believe that we

1303
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:19,290
have gotten many more of them to join

1304
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,480
the mailing list they're not likely to

1305
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:22,620
appear physically at an ITF meeting but

1306
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,179
they will be on the mailing list and

1307
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:26,730
we'll be able to move documents forward

1308
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:29,580
and participate in that way so the goal

1309
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:32,639
at the inter meeting was to review those

1310
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,860
14 potential documents and you know

1311
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,780
think about what they would consider the

1312
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:39,420
priority and how they wanted to approach

1313
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:41,880
them and then you know come here to seek

1314
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:45,150
adoption think of the tech ops group as

1315
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,980
a design team in an IETF context is sort

1316
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:49,799
of the way to view that body of people

1317
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:52,709
and the work that they do and then to

1318
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,750
bring those documents to this group and

1319
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:56,909
consider adoption here and move them

1320
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:58,260
along on the IETF side so

1321
01:12:56,909 --> 01:13:00,388
that's sort of the relationship and

1322
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:02,850
what's going on there we conducted that

1323
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:04,860
joint meeting under the ITF note well so

1324
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:06,719
that was exposed there and in that group

1325
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,159
and you know everybody aligned with that

1326
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,480
so that was a good thing it's worth

1327
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:13,080
noting that in the middle of the slide

1328
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:15,030
is a best practice not actually that

1329
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,260
should be best no it is it's best

1330
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:20,820
practice domains website there is a

1331
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:23,070
group of registrar's that have created a

1332
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:25,259
website all 14 of these documents in

1333
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:27,750
their original form from that group are

1334
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:29,460
on that website and so they had created

1335
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:31,469
a place where they had put things in

1336
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,810
fact have those documents are all

1337
01:13:31,469 --> 01:13:35,880
produced in our internet draft format

1338
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:38,219
for that matter and that's where they

1339
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:39,810
all work and having that discussion so

1340
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:42,389
good

1341
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:45,360
Alex may over I'm a little bit picky

1342
01:13:42,389 --> 01:13:47,760
here but you do know very well what

1343
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:50,400
internet standards in the ITF context

1344
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,040
means it's like the very core of the

1345
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:56,699
internet protocols that have extremely

1346
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:59,909
broad deployment and with a massive

1347
01:13:56,699 --> 01:14:01,620
amount of implementations I don't think

1348
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:08,699
that any of those 14 documents qualifies

1349
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:10,349
for that so at least about good portion

1350
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:11,699
in terms of like internet standards I

1351
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:15,980
don't know how many internet sentence we

1352
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:19,019
have but definitely not the 8600 yeah

1353
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:22,799
fair enough I I take your point and let

1354
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:25,739
me yeah you're right

1355
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:27,690
I was pretty freewheeling with saying

1356
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:30,239
the word standard I've been called on

1357
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:33,659
that before in fact just earlier this

1358
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:34,949
morning before this meeting so yeah we

1359
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:36,570
need to be a little more careful about

1360
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:38,099
use of that word it may be that some of

1361
01:14:36,570 --> 01:14:40,650
these things really become informational

1362
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:43,800
documents for example as opposed to to a

1363
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:45,690
standard and I do need to be much more

1364
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,690
careful about that in the IETF context

1365
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:49,949
the use of that particular word so fair

1366
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,480
enough we'll take that on board and as

1367
01:14:49,949 --> 01:14:53,040
part of our review and evaluation of

1368
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,870
these things will make a better

1369
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:57,239
determination of their status and what

1370
01:14:54,870 --> 01:15:01,980
we're supposed to do with them so next

1371
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:03,718
slide so this is a quick rundown of what

1372
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:06,178
we talked about there and I will touch

1373
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:08,659
on these briefly and and I'll spend

1374
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:10,679
actually a bit more time on the last one

1375
01:15:08,659 --> 01:15:12,870
the 14th

1376
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:15,420
can actually be brought together and

1377
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:19,050
categorized into these five documents in

1378
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:21,510
these five areas so registry mapping we

1379
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:24,030
really only referenced it in the in the

1380
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:26,699
in the interim meeting registry mapping

1381
01:15:24,030 --> 01:15:29,309
as you know has actually been work that

1382
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:31,080
has been moving forward slowly under the

1383
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:33,510
auspices of this working group it's not

1384
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:35,610
really an adopted document in this

1385
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:37,440
working group but there is an internet

1386
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:38,940
draft which is out there and there is a

1387
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,980
small set of people who have been

1388
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:45,659
progressing that document in particular

1389
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:48,360
you know Roger Carney and has been

1390
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:49,949
leading some interim meetings along the

1391
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:52,230
way here we've had several in trying to

1392
01:15:49,949 --> 01:15:54,000
advance this work it's not yet ready to

1393
01:15:52,230 --> 01:15:55,650
be adopted by the working group or to

1394
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,969
seek adoption of it but that work is

1395
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:59,159
proceeding so we're just gonna leave

1396
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:03,420
that one where it is at the moment the

1397
01:15:59,159 --> 01:16:06,230
secure authentication is notification in

1398
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:09,750
unhandled namespaces have all been

1399
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:11,610
documents here the SecureAuth have all

1400
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:13,760
been internet drafts the auth info

1401
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:18,630
document got quite a lot of discussion

1402
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:21,179
at the tech ops meeting and I think

1403
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:22,800
there is a revision of that document

1404
01:16:21,179 --> 01:16:25,020
which will be produced based on comments

1405
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,120
that were received there but all three

1406
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:30,989
of these are now in a relatively stable

1407
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:33,989
state and they will we expect that we

1408
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:35,459
will seek working group adoption for all

1409
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:36,959
three of these documents or at least the

1410
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,850
next version of secure auth info

1411
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,830
transfer and then the other two which

1412
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:42,239
have existed for some time we've had

1413
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:43,800
some discussions about them in this

1414
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:47,820
working group in the working group

1415
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,830
meetings and we will these authors will

1416
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,840
bring these documents and be seeking

1417
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:54,840
working group adoption on them in the

1418
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:58,199
near future and so we will seek to put

1419
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:59,600
them onto our registration services side

1420
01:16:58,199 --> 01:17:03,809
of the work stream in this working group

1421
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:06,270
and be looking to get some milestones

1422
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:09,390
for them and then I guess as was asked

1423
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:10,620
for before we'll need to get to document

1424
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:13,530
Sheppard's for each of those as part of

1425
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:16,860
the adoption process the registry

1426
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:20,370
registrar reporting document as you know

1427
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:23,250
we have we've had discussions here about

1428
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:24,389
an internet draft as you can see the

1429
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:27,829
reference on there the data

1430
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:31,289
set draft the dataset file format draft

1431
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:35,369
and in particular the registry register

1432
01:17:31,289 --> 01:17:38,309
our mapping was a new proposal concept

1433
01:17:35,369 --> 01:17:39,898
which myself and and my colleague who's

1434
01:17:38,309 --> 01:17:41,939
actually out there remotely Joseph he

1435
01:17:39,899 --> 01:17:43,800
had brought to the tech ops group to

1436
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:48,090
have some discussion about it and what

1437
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:50,369
I'd like to do here is just to make a

1438
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:52,019
presentation of a revised set of slides

1439
01:17:50,369 --> 01:17:54,030
it's just a few slides to sort of talk

1440
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:55,919
about the concept and expose it here in

1441
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:59,398
this group so that everyone has seen it

1442
01:17:55,919 --> 01:18:00,869
once we don't have a document that's an

1443
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:02,840
internet draft that's been published so

1444
01:18:00,869 --> 01:18:05,308
we're not going to immediately seek

1445
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:07,380
working from adoption on this thing but

1446
01:18:05,309 --> 01:18:08,999
it is work that we expected sometime in

1447
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:11,099
the not-too-distant future there'll be

1448
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:14,219
another internet draft and so there'll

1449
01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:16,139
be more discussion about this as as we

1450
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:19,199
move it forward I expect that it will

1451
01:18:16,139 --> 01:18:21,239
get a good deal more discussion in the

1452
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:23,280
tech ops group in particular because the

1453
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:26,518
registrar's and and the registries there

1454
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:28,530
will want to talk about you know what

1455
01:18:26,519 --> 01:18:30,630
that document looks like and what its

1456
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:34,380
relationship with the dataset file

1457
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:37,739
format document is so that we can bring

1458
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,939
both of those together and decide what

1459
01:18:37,739 --> 01:18:41,129
to move forward in this working group

1460
01:18:38,939 --> 01:18:43,590
and seek working group adoption on those

1461
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:45,419
things so that's actually the read out

1462
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:47,130
there I will I will jump to giving a

1463
01:18:45,419 --> 01:18:49,110
presentation about the reporting

1464
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:50,899
document in a moment but let's have a

1465
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:55,380
discussion on these five things and

1466
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:57,149
please George George from I panic so I

1467
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:59,010
would I'd like to start by saying I

1468
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:01,499
think you have a really good sense of

1469
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:03,329
the momentum in your agenda and you've

1470
01:19:01,499 --> 01:19:05,280
done a good job of a reduction of what

1471
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:08,340
needs to be done you've got a coach and

1472
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:11,669
story let's do this work so viewed from

1473
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:13,229
10,000 feet this is good you have a

1474
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:15,209
backlog of work you're looking at your

1475
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:16,649
adjustments and pace this is what you're

1476
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:17,669
going to carry forward in your stream

1477
01:19:16,649 --> 01:19:20,669
this is good

1478
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:22,679
I now step to another view I'm in the

1479
01:19:20,669 --> 01:19:25,530
other half of the room I'm in the RDoc

1480
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:28,079
half of the room the meeting the pace of

1481
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:31,699
the meeting is heading from somewhere

1482
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:34,499
around sixty forty to seventy thirty a

1483
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:37,440
business the business function registrar

1484
01:19:34,499 --> 01:19:39,780
registry function compared to the pub

1485
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,910
service of our that we don't actually

1486
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:44,219
get mind share and is probably a

1487
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:46,860
function of the nature of our work and

1488
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:49,290
it's not a comment more than a whinge

1489
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:51,150
but essentially we have very little mind

1490
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:53,790
share in this room and you're building a

1491
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:55,920
lot of work that's about registry

1492
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:58,530
registrar business the business an

1493
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,510
important function and I'm sitting over

1494
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:02,099
here saying where's our mind share to

1495
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:04,230
move forward in the public our dad

1496
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:06,330
commitment we we don't have this

1497
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:08,040
investment in time and energy coming to

1498
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:10,380
say look at the body of work let's do

1499
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,290
this this is our stream your stream is

1500
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,070
progressing our stream is paddling a

1501
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:16,590
little slower

1502
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:18,299
it just feels strange I don't think this

1503
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:21,420
is a problem you can fix I guess I'm

1504
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:26,340
just whinging it world rail rail rage

1505
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:27,770
against the night rage against the dying

1506
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:32,100
of the light

1507
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:32,940
yeah Thomas actually I'd like to address

1508
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,470
that a favor

1509
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:36,780
thank you sure I'm just going to respond

1510
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:40,710
to but I'll let you I personally go

1511
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:44,790
okhla backside that yeah there's only

1512
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:47,700
two slides so okay this didn't say

1513
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:50,190
anything useful for that but the the bit

1514
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:51,630
of taking the are DAP core protocol

1515
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:53,639
documents and progressing them to

1516
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:55,050
internet standard that we discuss that's

1517
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,760
gonna be new work and that's coming up

1518
01:20:55,050 --> 01:21:00,630
that's not a presentation we've had yet

1519
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:04,500
right but and I think so the answer

1520
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:06,630
there is I think over there thank you

1521
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:09,960
I think you'll see more meat when we get

1522
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:16,590
to that yeah that so I wouldn't worry

1523
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:18,720
about it too much now so just putting on

1524
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:21,570
a chairs hat for a moment recall that

1525
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:23,220
this working group essentially has two

1526
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:24,750
work streams if you want to think of it

1527
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:26,850
that way we have an our DAP work stream

1528
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:29,100
and a registration services work stream

1529
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:30,840
and the our DAP work stream has just

1530
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:33,210
been focused on Mario's documents

1531
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,070
primarily the ones that we were we were

1532
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:37,350
just talking about but we will see

1533
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:39,630
shortly that there is going to be a new

1534
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:41,760
work item that's going to be proposed

1535
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:43,230
when we when we get there well actually

1536
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,340
it's not even on the slides on the

1537
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:46,200
agenda it's gonna come up under any

1538
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,520
other business for that matter I just

1539
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,830
happen to have a heads up that is coming

1540
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,760
so there will be some some movement

1541
01:21:49,830 --> 01:21:52,200
there

1542
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:53,850
but you're right George you know I mean

1543
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:55,950
we have to work streams and so we have

1544
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:57,510
to develop and and move along work in

1545
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,059
both of those spaces and and the chairs

1546
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:01,890
do know that responsibility and accept

1547
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:03,120
that and we're certainly paying

1548
01:22:01,890 --> 01:22:05,670
attention to that detail

1549
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,200
sorry that's concern okay let me go back

1550
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:09,000
to just being myself here for the moment

1551
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,470
and we'll go to the slides on the

1552
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,600
registry registrar reporting and while

1553
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:16,380
he's working to bring up those slides so

1554
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:19,830
again this is just an introduction of a

1555
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:22,860
of a of a concept there are between

1556
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:26,280
registries and registrar's they do

1557
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:29,580
communicate there's a production

1558
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:33,240
you're gonna bring slides up yes yeah

1559
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:35,340
for the they-they-they they do

1560
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:37,380
communicate on a regular basis by a

1561
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:40,230
production of some reports so registries

1562
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:42,180
do provide some data a summary of some

1563
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:44,849
data back to registrar's as a way to

1564
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:47,280
facilitate their interactions and and

1565
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:48,840
how they conduct business and you know

1566
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,730
it's generally referred to as reporting

1567
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,500
in this context I mean that's sort of

1568
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:54,839
the work that happens in all of this and

1569
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:56,580
so every registry in today's world

1570
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,460
produces a set of reports that

1571
01:22:56,580 --> 01:23:02,370
registrar's consume and the overall goal

1572
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:04,830
here and the objective is to create some

1573
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:07,950
mechanism for creating stability in what

1574
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:09,630
those reports look like okay and that

1575
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,820
just seems and since that really is a

1576
01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:14,670
technical function it feels like it's an

1577
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:17,160
ideal thing to have in the ietf that

1578
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:20,250
sort of functionality now to allow some

1579
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:22,710
flexibility in all of this that's really

1580
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:25,350
what this is this is about so for here

1581
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:29,130
this is just about presenting a concept

1582
01:23:25,350 --> 01:23:31,140
which was presented there it half of

1583
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:34,140
this was reasonably well received and

1584
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:36,210
seemed to get a good traction and

1585
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:39,390
support and then there's a set of issues

1586
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:40,860
that were kind of set aside as still

1587
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:42,390
discussion points and I will separate

1588
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:44,160
those two here as we're going through

1589
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:46,410
these slides and then we'll see where we

1590
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,940
are so this is if anybody has any

1591
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:50,430
comments about this we certainly would

1592
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:52,139
welcome all that input but next steps

1593
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:54,660
here again are that this will just

1594
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:57,690
continue in its design effort for right

1595
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:59,519
now so this is just you know what do you

1596
01:23:57,690 --> 01:24:01,110
think you've obviously never seen this

1597
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,420
before because there's no document -

1598
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:04,519
except for the slides that exist but any

1599
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:06,620
reactions and

1600
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,150
you'll now have the slides and we can

1601
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:10,220
continue some discussion on the mailing

1602
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:12,950
list about this too so with that as an

1603
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:15,860
opener let's go to the next slide so

1604
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:17,780
this is some kind of a an example if you

1605
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:19,309
were to look at the best practice domain

1606
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:21,920
site you would see that there is a

1607
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:24,230
specification for you know at least

1608
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,790
these three reports transaction report a

1609
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,769
premium name support at the main info

1610
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:29,900
report there's some specifications there

1611
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:33,620
and you know this is what these things

1612
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:35,509
look like they are reports that are you

1613
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:37,220
know have these columns in them this the

1614
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:39,830
set of data elements that are there and

1615
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:42,530
and then you you know you create a file

1616
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:43,820
which has that data in it just thinking

1617
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:45,559
those terms and in terms of what's

1618
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,730
created and so this is just an example

1619
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,040
the fact that there's you know

1620
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:51,860
commonality across here and in fact you

1621
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:53,960
can run into issues about whether or not

1622
01:24:51,860 --> 01:24:55,519
you know status in each of those columns

1623
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,050
is the same status and whether it means

1624
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:59,000
the same thing or not you know so you

1625
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:00,350
know column headings therefore for the

1626
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:05,060
data that's being reported and what

1627
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:07,220
means next slide so what we had today

1628
01:25:05,060 --> 01:25:09,290
are reports that are static you know

1629
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:10,670
each registry just decides for itself

1630
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:12,260
what it's going to do and it does that

1631
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:14,530
and that's a done deal

1632
01:25:12,260 --> 01:25:16,970
the registry chooses that format contact

1633
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:19,280
content you know syntax of the reports

1634
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:20,870
and the Registrar is just required to

1635
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,240
comply with whatever the registry does

1636
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:25,790
and that's sort of the model that exists

1637
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:27,260
today and what's they are the kind of

1638
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:29,990
model that we're looking to get to here

1639
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,790
is that the reports are still static you

1640
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:34,160
know maybe stable is a better word here

1641
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:36,980
than saying the static but the format of

1642
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,599
the report is is standardized or that

1643
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:40,099
there is a there's a framework that

1644
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,170
there's a known mechanism for

1645
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:43,790
understanding the report so rather than

1646
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:45,470
the registry just being able to

1647
01:25:43,790 --> 01:25:48,620
unilaterally decide what something looks

1648
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:51,410
like there's there's a framework and a

1649
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:53,240
and a stability about what that reports

1650
01:25:51,410 --> 01:25:55,610
is likely to look like for registrar's

1651
01:25:53,240 --> 01:26:00,160
to consume them okay so to facilitate

1652
01:25:55,610 --> 01:26:02,230
that and provide a bit of a more stable

1653
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:04,519
mechanism for that communication

1654
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:05,660
obviously we still want the syntax of

1655
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,550
the elements in the report to be

1656
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:09,320
standardized we don't we don't want

1657
01:26:07,550 --> 01:26:11,660
people just inventing anything that they

1658
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:13,730
can put in these reports and to some

1659
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:15,769
extent you can imagine that even with

1660
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:17,089
EPP for example I mean we know what the

1661
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:18,010
registration data looks like there are

1662
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,719
some fairly

1663
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:22,760
definitions of a lot of this data that's

1664
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,920
there okay there's derived data that's

1665
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,300
in some of these reports but there's a

1666
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,820
certain stable set of data which is

1667
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:30,560
there we know what that is so that's the

1668
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:31,969
reporting elements you know being being

1669
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,989
standardized you want to know what's in

1670
01:26:31,969 --> 01:26:38,300
a report and and be able to consume them

1671
01:26:35,989 --> 01:26:41,179
easily and not have to look at each one

1672
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:44,420
as as an individualized registry based

1673
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:45,890
thing okay and then we also want to have

1674
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:48,320
an unknown set of reports we want to

1675
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:52,400
have a way to consume what reports are

1676
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:54,320
likely to look like okay so that's sort

1677
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,389
of you know where we where we are today

1678
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,719
and kind of the model of where we'd like

1679
01:26:56,390 --> 01:27:02,660
to get to in all this next slide so

1680
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:05,210
there basically are two principal parts

1681
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:08,180
of this proposal at the moment the

1682
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:10,940
concept here in both of these parts so

1683
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:14,200
this is part one I had some pretty good

1684
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:16,429
traction in the tech ops group last time

1685
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:18,440
but from the point of view of the idea

1686
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:20,120
what we do is we create and INR

1687
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:23,389
registering if you think of these

1688
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:25,040
reports as being a CSV file right that's

1689
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:27,800
what each report would look like so if

1690
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:30,920
you imagine that as the concept here we

1691
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:32,540
create an E and I in a registry and we

1692
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,580
model this after the way the epp

1693
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:36,230
extensions was done which is you know

1694
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:38,420
what sort of formed this group and cause

1695
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:40,639
this group to come into existence when

1696
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:42,800
we first did that document and so the

1697
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:44,000
column heading registry would have the

1698
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,610
following information that's listed

1699
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,230
there each particular column heading we

1700
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:50,120
get an ordinal value and you'll see why

1701
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:52,280
that's relevant when we get to the

1702
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,080
example obviously the name of the column

1703
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,820
a reference to the definition of the

1704
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,190
data that's there which of course would

1705
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:59,389
also define syntax for the element okay

1706
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,190
and then you want to know where the

1707
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:02,719
element came from and some other

1708
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:04,519
administrative elements but you know

1709
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:05,930
that's just sort of the registry that's

1710
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,880
in Ayana and it would be a

1711
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:09,770
first-come-first-served registry much

1712
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:12,710
like the epp extensions register areas

1713
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:15,170
so there's no the only strictness here

1714
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:16,790
about it is that the whatever you put in

1715
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:18,650
the registry is self-consistent and

1716
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:20,420
doesn't conflict with anything else

1717
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:21,920
that's there in this particular case

1718
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:24,890
that's you know kind of important that

1719
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:27,500
detail if people use a a status you want

1720
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:30,200
them to use the same status you know for

1721
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,730
that particular purpose so that's that

1722
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,769
concept go ahead

1723
01:28:31,730 --> 01:28:35,360
hi James Jimmy it's just a statement the

1724
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:37,220
bleedin obvious here but whenever these

1725
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,450
things could be put in a first-come

1726
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:39,830
first-served basis

1727
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:41,929
I hope this could be information

1728
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:44,120
recorded about who was that asked for

1729
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:46,790
this particular column to be added to

1730
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:48,650
the registry I've imagined the good of a

1731
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:50,330
situation where our registry asks for

1732
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:52,519
some kind of a karmic station boo boo

1733
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:54,559
here doesn't get used it's forgotten

1734
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:57,200
about and then cover comes always a 5-10

1735
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,460
years time then sees is anybody using

1736
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:02,870
this thing who's responsible for that

1737
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:04,160
can't get rid of it yes that's just sort

1738
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:05,330
of a standard problem first-come

1739
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:07,670
first-serve registries and do I

1740
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:09,170
understand that you know the only

1741
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:11,810
requirement would be that the reference

1742
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:13,970
of the definition exists maybe we do

1743
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:16,460
need to have a process for cleaning up

1744
01:29:13,970 --> 01:29:17,660
the registry if it gets big but we're

1745
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:19,400
not going to address that right now we

1746
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:21,290
don't have that we don't we don't speak

1747
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:23,900
to that issue even with EPP extensions I

1748
01:29:21,290 --> 01:29:25,460
was a specifically speaking to the issue

1749
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:27,950
of them includes but if this does come

1750
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:29,510
up later it's finger who's responsible

1751
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:31,970
for having that frosting in the first

1752
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:34,610
place if we've captured the information

1753
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:37,070
about who's requesting these things to

1754
01:29:34,610 --> 01:29:38,870
the registry yeah no registrant to the

1755
01:29:37,070 --> 01:29:41,480
element its captured right there okay

1756
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:43,550
one of those things yes yeah we do know

1757
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,719
who put it there which doesn't mean that

1758
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:46,310
you're gonna be able to reach them again

1759
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:48,560
because you know how that goes he mail

1760
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:49,820
addresses change I mean you know that

1761
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:53,270
doesn't really make the problem go away

1762
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:55,639
but okay next slide now there's actually

1763
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:57,230
four of these slides and I'm not really

1764
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,900
gonna walk down through them this is

1765
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:02,599
just intended to show that looking at

1766
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:04,549
the nine documents that are on the best

1767
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:07,340
practice the main site we simply

1768
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:08,720
collected together all of the column

1769
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:11,780
headings and all the data that was

1770
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,430
requested to be in those reports you can

1771
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:15,410
click to the next slide there you can

1772
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:17,390
see here there's an ordinal reference

1773
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:19,010
number each particular column heading at

1774
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:21,080
its own gets don't ordinal reference

1775
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:22,580
you'll see why that's important in a

1776
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,410
moment here when we get to part two and

1777
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:27,170
of course would be a reference to these

1778
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:29,150
things with respect to you know doing

1779
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:32,300
this particular work presumably we would

1780
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:34,460
pre fill this registry with whatever we

1781
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:36,080
define this first time around so the RFC

1782
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:37,460
number there is just the same for all of

1783
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:39,950
them whatever we put in our first

1784
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:41,990
document if we get that far and as is

1785
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:43,429
typical in these mechanisms in this case

1786
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:45,500
it would be the is G would be the

1787
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:47,540
registrant only because they would be

1788
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:49,070
find in an RFC the specification would

1789
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:52,010
be there and would be a working group

1790
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:54,049
product so that's why that works so yeah

1791
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:55,670
and there were 31 once we took those

1792
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:57,530
nine things together there were 31

1793
01:30:55,670 --> 01:30:59,540
elements that were looked for and this

1794
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:00,889
is again you know it's a concept so we

1795
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:03,860
just kind of looked at what was there

1796
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:06,050
when we put it together and made it made

1797
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:08,330
itself consistent so obviously there's

1798
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:09,980
some discussion to be had about whether

1799
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:11,390
that's the right set of data elements if

1800
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:13,429
there were need to be more or something

1801
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:15,980
like that that's certainly all open for

1802
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:18,050
discussion so that's one of the registry

1803
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:20,839
surtout two parts to this proposal one

1804
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:22,460
is to have a int registry of the column

1805
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:25,850
headings so the data essentially that

1806
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:28,040
goes into the reports next slide the

1807
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:30,620
next thing is to similarly create and I

1808
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:33,440
in a registry of actual reports that are

1809
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:34,820
used and what they look like and you

1810
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,500
know this is all exactly what you would

1811
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:38,330
expect it's fairly obvious stuff you

1812
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:41,690
know the report name reference to the

1813
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:43,820
definition and this is the critical part

1814
01:31:41,690 --> 01:31:45,799
that ties it back to the other registry

1815
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:48,620
the ordered list of column headings in

1816
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,820
the report using the ordinal value so

1817
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,590
let's go to the next slide and I'll show

1818
01:31:49,820 --> 01:31:53,299
you what that looks like this is

1819
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:54,770
actually the list of nine reports that

1820
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:57,170
are on the best practice that domain

1821
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:59,180
site so we just kind of build this built

1822
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:02,600
this out to show what it looks like and

1823
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:04,910
you can see here that the report name is

1824
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,500
over on the Left B a similar kind of

1825
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:08,570
reference and registrant but the columns

1826
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:10,460
there what you do is you list the

1827
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:13,309
ordinal number for the columns out of

1828
01:32:10,460 --> 01:32:15,830
the column registry so the data that you

1829
01:32:13,310 --> 01:32:19,000
want in this report out of the registry

1830
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:23,090
of the data elements that are possible

1831
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,800
and you make and that's an ordered list

1832
01:32:23,090 --> 01:32:26,570
is what's important and as you look

1833
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,940
through it you'll see in in some cases

1834
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:30,710
the numbers there are certainly not

1835
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:32,660
monotonically increasing well they're

1836
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:36,170
not increasing in any way monotonic or

1837
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:37,550
otherwise but it is a list of the data

1838
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:39,590
elements that are in that particular

1839
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:42,320
report and that's the way this much is

1840
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:46,420
supposed to work so that's kind of the I

1841
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:49,190
mean that in fact is the proposal for

1842
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:52,610
defining for creating a framework for

1843
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:54,559
stability in this reporting mechanism

1844
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:56,630
between registries and registrar's and

1845
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,069
these are the two parts that did get

1846
01:32:56,630 --> 01:33:00,569
some traction there and

1847
01:32:59,069 --> 01:33:02,699
the rest of the other side when we get

1848
01:33:00,569 --> 01:33:04,199
to them here are more about topics for

1849
01:33:02,699 --> 01:33:06,178
discussion that did not really have any

1850
01:33:04,199 --> 01:33:07,858
particular consensus and I'll talk about

1851
01:33:06,179 --> 01:33:10,649
what was going on with them when when we

1852
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:14,039
get there but okay Alex Alex may over

1853
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:17,639
Nick today tea could you please explain

1854
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:20,818
which kind of advantage you expect from

1855
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:22,589
publishing that information why the

1856
01:33:20,819 --> 01:33:23,969
process is at the ITF rather than

1857
01:33:22,589 --> 01:33:27,959
publishing them directly on best

1858
01:33:23,969 --> 01:33:29,519
practices or domains yes and in fact we

1859
01:33:27,959 --> 01:33:32,239
had quite a lot of discussion about this

1860
01:33:29,519 --> 01:33:35,879
even in the tech ops group going back to

1861
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:38,009
the may global domains missions ICANN's

1862
01:33:35,879 --> 01:33:39,209
GDD summit when the tech ops group had a

1863
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:43,199
meeting there there was a lot of

1864
01:33:39,209 --> 01:33:45,959
discussion about why this needs to be in

1865
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:48,239
in in the IETF is sort of the selected

1866
01:33:45,959 --> 01:33:49,829
SDO if you will to put it in the problem

1867
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:51,898
with best path suits best practice

1868
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:56,058
thought domains as compared to this is

1869
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:58,349
it's not a persistent archived reference

1870
01:33:56,059 --> 01:34:00,839
that's the issue it's just a website

1871
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:02,609
that somebody put up and as much as we

1872
01:34:00,839 --> 01:34:05,010
might want to believe that it is an

1873
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:08,010
ideal thing you know the key

1874
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:10,229
characteristics of any SDO is that it is

1875
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:13,049
a persistent archived point of reference

1876
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:14,519
you could create the key top repository

1877
01:34:13,049 --> 01:34:17,429
is probably more stable than best

1878
01:34:14,519 --> 01:34:19,379
practiced on domains you know we had the

1879
01:34:17,429 --> 01:34:21,209
discussion before this is rubber

1880
01:34:19,379 --> 01:34:23,489
stamping of a draft so that it gets an

1881
01:34:21,209 --> 01:34:25,619
RFC number so that somebody can work

1882
01:34:23,489 --> 01:34:27,808
after registry or registry and say hey

1883
01:34:25,619 --> 01:34:29,789
it's an RFC you need to implement it

1884
01:34:27,809 --> 01:34:33,539
that's the only reason and that was

1885
01:34:29,789 --> 01:34:35,818
Tobias said to me in person well it is a

1886
01:34:33,539 --> 01:34:37,829
it is a market issue whether or not

1887
01:34:35,819 --> 01:34:41,579
you're required to do something or or

1888
01:34:37,829 --> 01:34:41,938
not is is I mean this sorry sorry to

1889
01:34:41,579 --> 01:34:43,949
interrupt

1890
01:34:41,939 --> 01:34:46,739
especially because obviously those

1891
01:34:43,949 --> 01:34:48,989
documents get better review at the venue

1892
01:34:46,739 --> 01:34:50,999
that's outside of the ITF rather than

1893
01:34:48,989 --> 01:34:52,739
inside of the ITF so why doesn't that

1894
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:55,799
when you over there care about

1895
01:34:52,739 --> 01:35:01,018
publishing those documents this is pure

1896
01:34:55,799 --> 01:35:04,530
rubber stamping sorry I I don't view it

1897
01:35:01,019 --> 01:35:07,589
as rubber stamping i I can see where one

1898
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:10,199
might think of it that way the the ICANN

1899
01:35:07,589 --> 01:35:12,269
is not a technical body in that way I

1900
01:35:10,199 --> 01:35:13,018
would not expect I can as a body to

1901
01:35:12,269 --> 01:35:14,699
produce

1902
01:35:13,019 --> 01:35:17,729
you know this kind of technical

1903
01:35:14,699 --> 01:35:19,110
specification just meet personally and

1904
01:35:17,729 --> 01:35:21,539
in general there's a there's a

1905
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:24,179
relationship broadly speaking between

1906
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:26,360
the IETF and and and I can you know

1907
01:35:24,179 --> 01:35:30,150
technical specifications are generally

1908
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:32,938
looked for from from the IETF for the

1909
01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:35,030
most part and I can does the policy work

1910
01:35:32,939 --> 01:35:37,409
that goes that sits on top of these

1911
01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:39,449
specifications I mean that's just me

1912
01:35:37,409 --> 01:35:41,579
personally sort of talking others may

1913
01:35:39,449 --> 01:35:45,539
have a suddenly more nuanced view about

1914
01:35:41,579 --> 01:35:47,610
it all you're right I I have said about

1915
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:52,259
the best practice that domains thing

1916
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:54,478
that you know as a as a registry okay

1917
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:55,949
you know on the business side I don't

1918
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:58,439
want to implement something I don't want

1919
01:35:55,949 --> 01:36:00,659
to move toward something which is not in

1920
01:35:58,439 --> 01:36:03,269
fact a a persistent and archived

1921
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:04,619
reference and you know I can as an

1922
01:36:03,269 --> 01:36:07,019
organization just doesn't have that

1923
01:36:04,619 --> 01:36:09,329
facility but you know this is a

1924
01:36:07,019 --> 01:36:11,579
technical specification IETF is an ideal

1925
01:36:09,329 --> 01:36:14,249
place for it it works so I just came

1926
01:36:11,579 --> 01:36:15,719
here with it there might be other places

1927
01:36:14,249 --> 01:36:22,380
to take it but this is sort of the

1928
01:36:15,719 --> 01:36:24,959
natural choice sorry Jim this is as much

1929
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:28,969
as a technical specification as the

1930
01:36:24,959 --> 01:36:28,969
inventor east of his supermarket sorry

1931
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:41,909
okay okay that's fine I'll leave it at

1932
01:36:36,929 --> 01:36:44,550
that okay next slide we did talk about

1933
01:36:41,909 --> 01:36:47,039
some other things in that meeting these

1934
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:52,110
are just some some things that had come

1935
01:36:47,039 --> 01:36:53,459
up and they were not you know they were

1936
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:55,139
just they were discussion points they

1937
01:36:53,459 --> 01:36:58,229
were left as discussion points there was

1938
01:36:55,139 --> 01:37:01,979
no particular consensus about them so I

1939
01:36:58,229 --> 01:37:03,959
I collapsed based on the on the comments

1940
01:37:01,979 --> 01:37:07,679
that were in the tech ops meeting these

1941
01:37:03,959 --> 01:37:08,989
three items into you know just baseline

1942
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,489
requirements is what I called them here

1943
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:14,909
but anyway the reports would be CSV

1944
01:37:11,489 --> 01:37:16,199
files their reaction from folks in and I

1945
01:37:14,909 --> 01:37:17,429
thought this was kind of interesting I

1946
01:37:16,199 --> 01:37:21,178
hadn't really thought about this until

1947
01:37:17,429 --> 01:37:23,760
somebody started talking about it but if

1948
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:25,610
you start talking about actually

1949
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:28,070
creating a file or

1950
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:30,230
a file name or it being a CSV file as

1951
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:32,690
opposed to focusing on the framework in

1952
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:34,400
which to produce the reports whatever

1953
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:37,099
the report is whether the report is a

1954
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:41,719
file or some other delivery mechanism

1955
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:43,340
right then you need to separate that the

1956
01:37:41,719 --> 01:37:45,409
distribution mechanism the publication

1957
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:47,840
mechanism out from all of that that was

1958
01:37:45,409 --> 01:37:49,719
early discussion we had gotten into some

1959
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:51,980
people may not want to produce these

1960
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:53,630
reports as files they may have other

1961
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:55,070
mechanism for doing it and all the

1962
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:57,560
reasons for doing that which might be

1963
01:37:55,070 --> 01:38:01,460
perfectly reasonable so an open question

1964
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:03,409
really at large in the community is what

1965
01:38:01,460 --> 01:38:05,090
do we want the distribution mechanism to

1966
01:38:03,409 --> 01:38:07,250
look like and do we want any kind of

1967
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:10,070
stability in that or not so that remains

1968
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:11,150
to be an open question and then just you

1969
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:14,150
know the general question of

1970
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:17,960
unrecognized column headings what that

1971
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:19,699
really means if if a report is in the

1972
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:22,280
registry and it has a certain set of

1973
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:25,369
expected data elements that are present

1974
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:27,139
in the report what do you do if there

1975
01:38:25,369 --> 01:38:28,940
are additional data elements and the

1976
01:38:27,139 --> 01:38:30,170
report and how do you handle that some

1977
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:31,699
of that depends a little bit on the

1978
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:34,040
distribution mechanism but we can

1979
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:35,869
probably find some words that move

1980
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:37,820
towards the direction of just you know

1981
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:39,530
ignoring them or at least being able to

1982
01:38:37,820 --> 01:38:41,929
consume them but not actually doing

1983
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:43,730
anything with them sort of have to talk

1984
01:38:41,929 --> 01:38:46,840
about what we want that to look like so

1985
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:49,070
that's an open question next slide

1986
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:51,710
we did have some discussion at the time

1987
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:54,830
because when I had presented it at that

1988
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:56,210
time discussion about a file name

1989
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:57,559
because there are other kinds of

1990
01:38:56,210 --> 01:39:00,320
metadata issues so one of the things

1991
01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:02,570
that comes up is we do have the data set

1992
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,400
file format which this group has looked

1993
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:06,320
at before we've had a presentation about

1994
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:08,480
it and talked about it one of the

1995
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:10,580
interesting things a clear distinction

1996
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:13,190
between the data set file format and

1997
01:39:10,580 --> 01:39:16,250
this proposal is the data set file

1998
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:18,169
format actually does cover the metadata

1999
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:20,179
and the full set of metadata that would

2000
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:24,290
go with this reporting mechanism this

2001
01:39:20,179 --> 01:39:25,639
kind of has implied metadata or some

2002
01:39:24,290 --> 01:39:27,230
amount of metadata it would be in the

2003
01:39:25,639 --> 01:39:29,360
file name if we were to specify a file

2004
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:31,339
name for it but that of course implies a

2005
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,480
certain distribution mechanism so

2006
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:34,369
there's some question as to whether

2007
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,790
that's the right thing to do and maybe

2008
01:39:34,369 --> 01:39:39,499
we need to do something different and so

2009
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:41,059
you know that's why all of this is there

2010
01:39:39,499 --> 01:39:43,039
this was what the original proposal

2011
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:44,690
wasn't thinking about filenames we tried

2012
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:46,849
to put out there sort of the minimum

2013
01:39:44,690 --> 01:39:49,610
kind of metadata that one might want and

2014
01:39:46,849 --> 01:39:51,349
need as part of doing this report but

2015
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:53,690
again it just became an open question

2016
01:39:51,349 --> 01:39:54,820
when it was all done I think that's it

2017
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:57,049
isn't it

2018
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:58,670
yeah that was the last slide so that's

2019
01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:59,989
where we are so these last two slides

2020
01:39:58,670 --> 01:40:02,360
are you know still just sort of

2021
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:04,308
discussion points I expect that we the

2022
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:05,960
the next steps here are that we will

2023
01:40:04,309 --> 01:40:09,559
have some discussion continuing on our

2024
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:11,300
on our mailing list here the the tech

2025
01:40:09,559 --> 01:40:15,170
ops as a design team is going to

2026
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:16,400
continue to you know talk about what

2027
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:20,780
would work best for that particular

2028
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:25,039
registry and and registrar community and

2029
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:27,018
then we'll just you know look to to

2030
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:30,920
continue and finalize any discussion

2031
01:40:27,019 --> 01:40:34,809
here in the in the ITF um Marko's have

2032
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:39,010
Zdenek I'm not so much about or against

2033
01:40:34,809 --> 01:40:44,179
standardizing this Alex is I'm a bit

2034
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:46,639
okay I'm unimpressed about this I just

2035
01:40:44,179 --> 01:40:49,340
have the feeling that we're you know

2036
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:51,110
this working group is over and over and

2037
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:54,530
over again standardizing the same things

2038
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:58,639
and this is just a new variation of

2039
01:40:54,530 --> 01:41:01,719
escrow if if this group says that escrow

2040
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:05,210
is a working group item and we define

2041
01:41:01,719 --> 01:41:07,249
escrow formats this is the same thing

2042
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:10,099
just that the flow of the data is in

2043
01:41:07,249 --> 01:41:12,800
another direction but coming up with a

2044
01:41:10,099 --> 01:41:17,800
new syntax and column headings and it's

2045
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,800
it's it's the same work we'd done before

2046
01:41:22,679 --> 01:41:27,659
I just trying to think about how to to

2047
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:29,909
your right you know all of these are

2048
01:41:27,659 --> 01:41:31,710
about data flow I guess the only

2049
01:41:29,909 --> 01:41:33,870
immediate observation occurs to me is

2050
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:35,640
the actual data in each of these two

2051
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:36,210
sets of things really is somewhat

2052
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:38,100
different

2053
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:43,620
you know the escrow is about the

2054
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:46,110
registration data these reports are more

2055
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:48,540
about data that's coming through a pp

2056
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:49,889
and collecting elements that are coming

2057
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:52,530
from there especially the transaction

2058
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:54,800
reports for example or you know name

2059
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:59,309
service that go with the domain name so

2060
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:02,040
there's a it's not always true I mean

2061
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:04,290
there's a bias away from personal

2062
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:05,310
information except that there are

2063
01:42:04,290 --> 01:42:07,650
reports that do have personal

2064
01:42:05,310 --> 01:42:09,179
information in them so that's not really

2065
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:10,889
a hundred percent true

2066
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:13,290
the data escrow is very clearly all the

2067
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:15,060
registration data there's there's a lot

2068
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:18,239
more data in these reports that is not

2069
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:20,460
in escrow I guess is really kind of my

2070
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:21,839
point at the moment but although I said

2071
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:24,260
I take your point I just I don't know

2072
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:30,270
what to do with it yet go ahead Alex

2073
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:32,219
Alex again to be quite frankly quite

2074
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:33,690
clear I'm not against analyzing those

2075
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:36,659
things because we all know that those

2076
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:38,699
are a lot of a burden to the community

2077
01:42:36,659 --> 01:42:40,710
of the registries registrar's yeah I

2078
01:42:38,699 --> 01:42:43,620
just as I said a couple times I don't

2079
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:46,080
feel that an RFC is like the right the

2080
01:42:43,620 --> 01:42:48,630
right when you to publish it and to be

2081
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:52,620
to give like the this a little bit of

2082
01:42:48,630 --> 01:42:54,330
more of a productive touch for example

2083
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:56,370
there is something that's called the

2084
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:58,860
registrar registry data group that

2085
01:42:56,370 --> 01:43:01,440
exists is like an informal group within

2086
01:42:58,860 --> 01:43:03,330
the center environment sort of like and

2087
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:05,129
we have been doing some kind of

2088
01:43:03,330 --> 01:43:08,340
standardization here as well and we have

2089
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:11,400
published a couple of documents web

2090
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:13,620
pages on on a web page that that states

2091
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:15,420
how V is group belief that things should

2092
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:19,469
be done and people are actually

2093
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:22,140
implementing that so so that could be

2094
01:43:19,469 --> 01:43:24,120
another way it's a little bit sad to see

2095
01:43:22,140 --> 01:43:26,460
that to understand that there's C PhD

2096
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:27,929
cups can't publish stable documents if I

2097
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:34,260
get that right those stable document

2098
01:43:27,929 --> 01:43:35,460
references but yeah so again I have

2099
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:36,330
nothing against standardizing those

2100
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,760
things

2101
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:40,500
feel that the scope of the IDF doesn't

2102
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:47,520
really fit the purpose of those

2103
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:50,490
documents 100% okay thank you okay Jim

2104
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:54,300
if I can step in chair head off

2105
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:56,460
I hear an interesting thing here we've

2106
01:43:54,300 --> 01:44:00,210
had this discussion before you know I

2107
01:43:56,460 --> 01:44:07,760
realize that tech ops in Wadena I can is

2108
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:13,020
a gTLD only accessible group centre is a

2109
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:15,720
ccTLD exclusive group we're here in the

2110
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:18,180
IDF to standardize things if we want to

2111
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:21,780
standardize things we should open these

2112
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:28,440
groups and discuss among them among each

2113
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:31,349
other now what the what the joint

2114
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:33,660
definition should be I think that would

2115
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:35,220
be very valuable not everybody going to

2116
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:36,800
sit in their own group and and with all

2117
01:44:35,220 --> 01:44:40,590
due respect I said this before

2118
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:43,560
everything that comes from I can work in

2119
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:47,490
groups feels like pressure of doing

2120
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:53,220
things for policy instead of choosing

2121
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:56,820
the correct technical background I very

2122
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:58,590
appreciated that detector of groups had

2123
01:44:56,820 --> 01:45:00,389
a joined interim meeting which rejects

2124
01:44:58,590 --> 01:45:04,860
because that opened it up for other

2125
01:45:00,390 --> 01:45:06,960
participants to join but I think we need

2126
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:09,799
to have more of it to not get the

2127
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:16,890
impression that we are being run by item

2128
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:21,500
and that's just my remark okay Peggy the

2129
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:24,510
first time alex is a lot taller than I

2130
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:27,450
though so Roger Carney says another

2131
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:29,850
reason to bring to the IETF I don't

2132
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:31,139
remember what he's talking about this I

2133
01:45:29,850 --> 01:45:32,550
was gonna make that comment - I know

2134
01:45:31,140 --> 01:45:37,170
where Rogers coming from Thank You Roger

2135
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:41,570
I had that on my mind so speaking for

2136
01:45:37,170 --> 01:45:44,850
myself I let's see

2137
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:47,429
you're right center is ccTLD you know

2138
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:50,189
this particular tech ops group is gTLD

2139
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:52,079
that in fact is the reason why bring

2140
01:45:50,189 --> 01:45:54,449
to the ITF er it is at least another

2141
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:56,518
reason why bring me to the ITF is sort

2142
01:45:54,449 --> 01:46:00,419
of an ideal thing because it is an open

2143
01:45:56,519 --> 01:46:04,979
group and I know that it's easy to think

2144
01:46:00,419 --> 01:46:08,340
that something originates in ICANN and

2145
01:46:04,979 --> 01:46:11,489
and people have a certain target view

2146
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:12,959
about ICANN wanting to point a negative

2147
01:46:11,489 --> 01:46:16,348
finger at them for any number of reasons

2148
01:46:12,959 --> 01:46:19,229
but you know speaking for myself I you

2149
01:46:16,349 --> 01:46:21,209
know this idea for this work might have

2150
01:46:19,229 --> 01:46:22,380
originated that I can but I don't see

2151
01:46:21,209 --> 01:46:24,090
that as any different than the work

2152
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:25,860
originating anywhere else you know I

2153
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:28,499
mean the idea came up it's a problem

2154
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:30,209
that needs to be solved you know from my

2155
01:46:28,499 --> 01:46:33,030
point of view speaking personally this

2156
01:46:30,209 --> 01:46:34,979
is a good home for solving it I'm gonna

2157
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:36,719
take advantage of whatever I need to

2158
01:46:34,979 --> 01:46:39,719
take advantage of to get the best work

2159
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:42,510
possible and I think that it's incumbent

2160
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:45,030
on us to look at both the what Center

2161
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:46,860
has done and what you know the the tech

2162
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:48,360
ops group is sort of proposing and we

2163
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:50,219
bring them here in this community and we

2164
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:52,049
discuss them here openly and bring both

2165
01:46:50,219 --> 01:46:55,559
sets of groups here so I don't I don't

2166
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:58,289
see this as a as a stumbling block or a

2167
01:46:55,559 --> 01:46:59,909
concern I see it as an opportunity you

2168
01:46:58,289 --> 01:47:01,259
know and let's just bring the work here

2169
01:46:59,909 --> 01:47:03,808
and do the right thing with it and

2170
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:06,119
that's really what I'm after here just a

2171
01:47:03,809 --> 01:47:10,019
minute did you so my question actually

2172
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:14,219
is are there other participants that we

2173
01:47:10,019 --> 01:47:18,510
need to involve in this apart from

2174
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:19,439
ccTLDs and gTLDs so I'm thinking of ours

2175
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:24,059
I don't know

2176
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:26,909
Edom registries yeah but I'm thinking of

2177
01:47:24,059 --> 01:47:31,189
you know how can we get the most broad

2178
01:47:26,909 --> 01:47:33,478
support for something to standardize I

2179
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:35,579
you know I I don't know I think that's a

2180
01:47:33,479 --> 01:47:38,070
standard probably if you will a standard

2181
01:47:35,579 --> 01:47:39,299
problem in any ITF you know making sure

2182
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:41,849
you've got the right community of people

2183
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:44,130
but you know we have we have put

2184
01:47:41,849 --> 01:47:46,709
together a community of people who have

2185
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:50,369
a shared problem and they want to have a

2186
01:47:46,709 --> 01:47:52,590
a stable you know singular if you will

2187
01:47:50,369 --> 01:47:54,539
solution to that problem and we're just

2188
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:56,189
a group of people moving towards that

2189
01:47:54,539 --> 01:47:58,469
and you know that's sort of the role

2190
01:47:56,189 --> 01:48:00,300
that the IETF plays do we have everybody

2191
01:47:58,469 --> 01:48:02,579
in the IHF that we need we don't recruit

2192
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,900
people per se but I think that at least

2193
01:48:02,579 --> 01:48:06,240
speaking personally

2194
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:09,929
I've done what I can to reach out to

2195
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:13,980
communities I can get to to to get some

2196
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:15,390
review and and cover of this this the

2197
01:48:13,980 --> 01:48:17,190
solution space that we're looking at

2198
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:19,770
here and we'll continue to do that as we

2199
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:22,019
go along looking at the time and cutting

2200
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:24,120
the line after thanks yeah

2201
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:25,710
Jimmy's very couple quick comments Jim I

2202
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:27,510
think your approach is very safe on

2203
01:48:25,710 --> 01:48:30,540
pragmatic and she's just go ahead with

2204
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:32,340
this alex concerns about the ATF drop or

2205
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:34,650
stomping a rail maids but I think the

2206
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:36,120
mayor Bell isn't misguided and I think

2207
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:38,190
the thing to do here is is great clear

2208
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:39,960
that this working group seems to be the

2209
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:41,820
obvious focus for all to kind of

2210
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:44,460
therefore rather than have closed

2211
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:46,769
communities such as I can gTLD folks

2212
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:47,910
maybe I can registries I just I'm so

2213
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:50,100
glad seeing this kind of thing as

2214
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:52,349
thinking this to both of good a center

2215
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:54,930
which is a closed Club for Europeans ECT

2216
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:56,670
of these again doesn't address of

2217
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:59,070
completely audits of the complete

2218
01:48:56,670 --> 01:49:00,390
community this seems the right place to

2219
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:03,480
this kind of thing so I think we should

2220
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:04,980
go ahead and do this work yeah and if we

2221
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:06,389
feel that this is being abused because

2222
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:08,280
we've been just me expect to

2223
01:49:06,390 --> 01:49:12,420
rubber-stamp stuff this done anybody

2224
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:16,259
else deal without problem arises thanks

2225
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:20,220
Jim Rick thanks Rick Wilhelm um

2226
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:22,670
just a comment Jim I think your your

2227
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:25,770
comments about the CPI tech ops are

2228
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:28,530
largely right on I will offer that

2229
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:30,570
there's there's not while there's been a

2230
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:34,559
fair bit of discussion about this at CPA

2231
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:37,799
checkups there's not a complete

2232
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:39,810
agreement and consensus on the problem

2233
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:44,040
to be solved the way it should be solved

2234
01:49:39,810 --> 01:49:46,650
and and such so it's not when we're and

2235
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:49,710
this stuff is coming here from CPH tech

2236
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:52,679
ops it's it's not coming with sort of a

2237
01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:55,920
a it's coming with a set of support but

2238
01:49:52,680 --> 01:49:58,200
not the mast and agreed there wasn't a

2239
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,390
consensus call done within CPH tech ops

2240
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:02,250
or or something like that right so

2241
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:06,900
there's still a fair bit of debate

2242
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:09,950
myself included around the the merits of

2243
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:12,570
this kind of a proposal and what it

2244
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:14,370
memorializes because these reports are

2245
01:50:12,570 --> 01:50:16,860
the manifestation of a business

2246
01:50:14,370 --> 01:50:17,510
relationship between two entities and

2247
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:20,750
they're Purdue

2248
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:23,210
extra extra contractually by which I

2249
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:25,820
mean not as part of a contractual

2250
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:29,360
requirement which stands in contrast to

2251
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:32,989
the EPP work and the RDF work which is

2252
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:35,900
part of both they are both part of

2253
01:50:32,989 --> 01:50:41,719
contracts for gTLD registries and

2254
01:50:35,900 --> 01:50:44,599
registrar's thanks thank you so thanks

2255
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:46,580
for all the comments I again I think

2256
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:48,710
what we're gonna do here is is continue

2257
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:50,239
this just as as you know design work

2258
01:50:48,710 --> 01:50:51,920
evolutionary work much like registry

2259
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:53,839
mapping it's just gonna move forward

2260
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:54,950
with a group of people and and we'll see

2261
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,600
where we get to with that so we're not

2262
01:50:54,950 --> 01:50:58,730
doing any kind of call for adoption yet

2263
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,560
but this is just a heads up that this

2264
01:50:58,730 --> 01:51:02,780
kind of thing is moving forward and

2265
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,970
it'll stay visible just like registry

2266
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:07,280
mapping in this group and and we'll see

2267
01:51:04,970 --> 01:51:10,160
where it goes so let me go back to like

2268
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:13,550
it never do thank you Jim

2269
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:15,880
you know well actually as part of this

2270
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:18,440
this item on the agenda we were going to

2271
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:21,260
try to have discussion on the new

2272
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:24,410
milestones but looking at the time I

2273
01:51:21,260 --> 01:51:26,320
think we will move that over to the to

2274
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:28,550
the mailing list because we still have

2275
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:34,330
two presentations and we only have ten

2276
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:37,640
minutes left so let us continue on that

2277
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:41,890
we have a presentation again by Mario

2278
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:41,890
and Mario you have four minutes

2279
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:56,270
okay

2280
01:51:56,660 --> 01:52:04,260
after last meeting discussion about the

2281
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:09,030
possible replacement of jacquard weave

2282
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:14,280
Jay's contact in our top 40 could be

2283
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:19,889
useful for the working group to have a

2284
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:25,530
short overview of Jay's contact to make

2285
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:29,190
you more aware of its fine features but

2286
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:33,230
at the same time to demonstrate that it

2287
01:52:29,190 --> 01:52:37,110
could really be a more efficient

2288
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:40,349
alternative to jihad and in brief Jay's

2289
01:52:37,110 --> 01:52:43,700
quantity is a new contact cut the

2290
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:46,650
representation alternative to be hard

2291
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:51,030
like Jacobs json-based

2292
01:52:46,650 --> 01:52:57,440
and a fully support the book are content

2293
01:52:51,030 --> 01:53:01,380
but it's not directly derived by be cut

2294
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:04,919
it it follows an uglier structured

2295
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:08,880
approached the information modeling the

2296
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:12,780
main object define the contact card

2297
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:18,060
named jes card any collection of cotton

2298
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:22,410
cards named Jess car group the draft is

2299
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:26,550
the devastation of the draft is 0-5 and

2300
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:29,639
is written by me and together with

2301
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:31,500
Robert Stephanie of first male and the

2302
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:35,670
current working group is dispatch even

2303
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:38,340
if gem map seems to be it is not we are

2304
01:53:35,670 --> 01:53:40,080
rich ordering Jana as we suggest to

2305
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:43,400
include this already done in the Gienapp

2306
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:47,970
working group okay thank you

2307
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:50,820
the the the draft obviously is still in

2308
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:53,670
brown in progress we are some open

2309
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:57,170
issues on the table in particular how to

2310
01:53:53,670 --> 01:54:01,470
represent the gender information if we

2311
01:53:57,170 --> 01:54:03,510
should include endow to include the

2312
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:06,510
information needed for teasing

2313
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:11,539
or multiple versions of the same contact

2314
01:54:06,510 --> 01:54:11,539
card and which is the best way to

2315
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:20,039
represent the information about the

2316
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:22,250
preference a new version is ready to be

2317
01:54:20,039 --> 01:54:22,250
published

2318
01:54:23,159 --> 01:54:35,690
one minute jump to skip this I want to

2319
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:41,699
only to provide you with some examples

2320
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:47,820
in the left side of the slide there is

2321
01:54:41,699 --> 01:54:50,610
an extract from inaudible response using

2322
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:54,110
a jacquard and the red side there is the

2323
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:57,509
corresponding version of the Jas card

2324
01:54:54,110 --> 01:55:01,530
the properties involved are currently

2325
01:54:57,510 --> 01:55:07,250
required in adapt the other two examples

2326
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:10,829
are taken by some use cases provide me

2327
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:14,239
prior to me by Tamera zone to test the

2328
01:55:10,829 --> 01:55:17,400
J's contact capability to represent

2329
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:20,789
multilingual information and a structure

2330
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:26,480
data like formatted the addresses and

2331
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:29,400
formatting names please move to the next

2332
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:34,589
this is an example of multilingual

2333
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:41,789
information and the in the other the

2334
01:55:34,590 --> 01:55:43,619
next one is the an example to represent

2335
01:55:41,789 --> 01:55:45,960
a structured data the last slide is

2336
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:50,909
about a possible transition model

2337
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:53,429
between jacquard and yes god

2338
01:55:50,909 --> 01:55:56,039
the first scenario corresponds to the

2339
01:55:53,429 --> 01:55:58,579
reverse state who's implementing the

2340
01:55:56,039 --> 01:55:58,579
current

2341
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:04,880
adapt standard so it is identified but

2342
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:07,940
they are double level zero taking that

2343
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:10,550
of conformance array in this scenario J

2344
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:13,490
cadiz require and J's card is optional

2345
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:15,980
it can be requested by setting the

2346
01:56:13,490 --> 01:56:19,450
parameter parameter just cut to true and

2347
01:56:15,980 --> 01:56:23,179
the next scenario is the scenario

2348
01:56:19,450 --> 01:56:27,250
corresponding to when the transition is

2349
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:31,790
completed as in this scenario they serve

2350
01:56:27,250 --> 01:56:36,190
implements J J's code as required and

2351
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:39,800
jagged as optional I think that this

2352
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:42,620
transition model has some advantages

2353
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:44,900
only one content representation would be

2354
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:48,380
including to the response the response

2355
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:50,740
would always be compared to have c74 t3

2356
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:53,060
but what is much more important is that

2357
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:55,490
backward compatibility will be

2358
01:56:53,060 --> 01:56:58,160
guaranteed throughout the transition and

2359
01:56:55,490 --> 01:57:03,550
the Severson kind could execute the

2360
01:56:58,160 --> 01:57:12,400
transition in an independent way stop

2361
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:12,400
that's all questions short leash

2362
01:57:17,019 --> 01:57:26,389
question I should just you know take the

2363
01:57:20,119 --> 01:57:30,320
discussion to the list yeah take a look

2364
01:57:26,389 --> 01:57:36,469
at this lied to private fiber feedback

2365
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:42,978
to me okay then we have a new verse

2366
01:57:36,469 --> 01:57:45,019
suggestion for so very quickly we did a

2367
01:57:42,979 --> 01:57:47,479
we did a site meeting next slide please

2368
01:57:45,019 --> 01:57:48,949
on the main suggestion on Tuesday

2369
01:57:47,479 --> 01:57:50,329
morning great about 15 people in the

2370
01:57:48,949 --> 01:57:53,030
room some of them were reading email I

2371
01:57:50,329 --> 01:57:57,409
guess it was mostly registry site people

2372
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:59,420
and yeah next slide please so the main

2373
01:57:57,409 --> 01:58:00,709
suggestion we I guess we all know what

2374
01:57:59,420 --> 01:58:05,780
it is the customer wants a domain name

2375
01:58:00,709 --> 01:58:07,579
domain name is taken and someone

2376
01:58:05,780 --> 01:58:11,659
proposes an alternative for the customer

2377
01:58:07,579 --> 01:58:13,719
so that's what registry is typically do

2378
01:58:11,659 --> 01:58:16,009
next please

2379
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:17,449
very quickly that's that's essentially

2380
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:19,849
the sense of things so there's a name

2381
01:58:17,449 --> 01:58:23,239
it's taken and some kind of tool

2382
01:58:19,849 --> 01:58:26,840
proposes a different name to register to

2383
01:58:23,239 --> 01:58:28,759
the customer next so the question is now

2384
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:30,380
is registrar's that was like directly to

2385
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:32,179
registry end of things registrar's also

2386
01:58:30,380 --> 01:58:34,699
want to do that maybe some of them have

2387
01:58:32,179 --> 01:58:36,380
quite sophisticated tools already but if

2388
01:58:34,699 --> 01:58:38,299
they actually fetch information from the

2389
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:40,909
registries for that and they might want

2390
01:58:38,300 --> 01:58:45,130
to have a standardized API in order to

2391
01:58:40,909 --> 01:58:47,719
get that from the registries yeah so

2392
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:49,789
registrar's deal with many registries so

2393
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:52,900
in in turn it would be really said if

2394
01:58:49,789 --> 01:58:57,949
each and registry invented their own API

2395
01:58:52,900 --> 01:59:01,098
for dealing with suggestions next please

2396
01:58:57,949 --> 01:59:02,478
yeah essentially the protocol arena we

2397
01:59:01,099 --> 01:59:04,130
could do that they were over APB we

2398
01:59:02,479 --> 01:59:06,380
could do that order up we could do it

2399
01:59:04,130 --> 01:59:08,659
over some other arrests other protocols

2400
01:59:06,380 --> 01:59:10,999
there's a range of input data that's

2401
01:59:08,659 --> 01:59:13,188
maybe useful to create domain name

2402
01:59:10,999 --> 01:59:15,199
suggestions for a customer some of

2403
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:18,590
that's actually a personal information

2404
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:21,589
of the customer so that's tricky that

2405
01:59:18,590 --> 01:59:23,809
the area can work in next one

2406
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:26,030
so there's existing work there series

2407
01:59:23,809 --> 01:59:27,650
things there's an EPP extension from

2408
01:59:26,030 --> 01:59:28,989
Verisign that actually got as far as

2409
01:59:27,650 --> 01:59:31,450
understand deprecated or

2410
01:59:28,989 --> 01:59:35,080
is pulled out out of the SDK in favor of

2411
01:59:31,450 --> 01:59:39,460
a rest-based model there is some work on

2412
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:41,710
our debt-based by Mario he uses a link

2413
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:44,440
in a standard up response to point to a

2414
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:45,700
suggestion server and and then he was

2415
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:47,469
like a lightweight domains archery

2416
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:49,239
surgery and then as there is not a PP

2417
01:59:47,469 --> 01:59:50,920
extension that that I actually created

2418
01:59:49,239 --> 01:59:52,839
because I wasn't aware of the where is

2419
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:57,190
an extension that extends the domain

2420
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:58,719
check response next so what was the

2421
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:00,849
major discussion during the site meeting

2422
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:03,730
so the major points where the the

2423
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:05,410
register is better positioned and it has

2424
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:06,669
a better vantage point and the registry

2425
02:00:05,410 --> 02:00:08,230
probably for many things because he

2426
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:12,730
skills to the customer so he knows what

2427
02:00:08,230 --> 02:00:14,230
the customer once suggestion should sort

2428
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:15,989
of like belong to the free market it's

2429
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:18,669
not something that the the the

2430
02:00:15,989 --> 02:00:20,349
registration to and the registry has

2431
02:00:18,670 --> 02:00:21,700
like a little bit better Wantage point

2432
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:23,739
because they are aware of expiring

2433
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:25,389
domain names and stuff like that we also

2434
02:00:23,739 --> 02:00:26,709
found out the DPP's problem of the good

2435
02:00:25,390 --> 02:00:28,750
protocol choice in the first place

2436
02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:30,570
because it's a static interface it's for

2437
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:33,480
provisioning rather than for querying

2438
02:00:30,570 --> 02:00:35,769
things like water come into play is that

2439
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:38,440
any suggestion would introduce

2440
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:41,050
additional delay and dependencies in the

2441
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:43,269
registry core which we all want to avoid

2442
02:00:41,050 --> 02:00:44,739
and it does indeed address a different

2443
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:46,710
time set because the suggestion is

2444
02:00:44,739 --> 02:00:48,879
targeted at the end customer while the

2445
02:00:46,710 --> 02:00:51,130
EPP interface is targeted at the

2446
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,080
registry so it might be related to the

2447
02:00:51,130 --> 02:00:54,850
availability information and for that

2448
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:57,610
our dub seems to be quite an interesting

2449
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:59,290
choice the problem with that was that

2450
02:00:57,610 --> 02:01:01,989
the room was full of registries in the

2451
02:00:59,290 --> 02:01:05,469
way a few registrar's so next one place

2452
02:01:01,989 --> 02:01:07,000
your discussion if we would have time

2453
02:01:05,469 --> 02:01:09,820
that would have been the points that I

2454
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,410
would want to discuss but to sum it up

2455
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:14,980
in one sentence I think I will go ahead

2456
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:17,230
and do some rest based API that I will

2457
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:20,169
send out to whatever other group

2458
02:01:17,230 --> 02:01:22,480
probably and and see if somebody else is

2459
02:01:20,170 --> 02:01:24,370
interested yeah from my point is

2460
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:28,269
interesting is reg X the right when you

2461
02:01:24,370 --> 02:01:29,769
I start believing it's not yeah Roger

2462
02:01:28,270 --> 02:01:31,870
Carney thinks this might be good for

2463
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:35,190
many smaller registrar's larger

2464
02:01:31,870 --> 02:01:35,190
registrar's already do this

2465
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:40,120
you read I'm sorry to see Alex I think

2466
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:42,910
this is a very very bad idea

2467
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:44,950
it said doesn't need to be standardized

2468
02:01:42,910 --> 02:01:46,120
I'm giving you their comments but

2469
02:01:44,950 --> 02:01:47,860
rubber-stamping I think it's rather

2470
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:49,870
nitronic suggesting bringing up other

2471
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:50,710
BOTS to the regex which might be getting

2472
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:53,290
done elsewhere

2473
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:57,120
I think mr. pilot you just kill it don't

2474
02:01:53,290 --> 02:01:57,120
bring here ok fair enough

2475
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:04,150
ok thank you

2476
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:05,650
that brings us to any other business and

2477
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:09,129
we're already one minute late but I

2478
02:02:05,650 --> 02:02:10,660
believe that Scott had a yes Scott

2479
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:12,240
Hollenbeck I'll try to go as quickly as

2480
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:15,940
I can so thank you for sticking around

2481
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:17,500
we have five proposed standard RFC s

2482
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:19,120
that have been out now for about four

2483
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:23,470
years and the our DAP specifications

2484
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:25,300
were published in 2015 we right so the

2485
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:27,640
our DAP specifications were published in

2486
02:02:25,300 --> 02:02:30,760
2015 we now have production

2487
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:32,230
implementation experience anyway long

2488
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:34,300
and short of it I'm thinking it's time

2489
02:02:32,230 --> 02:02:37,240
that we look to address the captured

2490
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:39,460
errata which are all editorial as far as

2491
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:41,650
I can tell and take on an effort to move

2492
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:44,230
those five documents to internet

2493
02:02:41,650 --> 02:02:45,790
standards status so I had mentioned this

2494
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:47,200
at the Montreal meeting you know had a

2495
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:48,700
couple of sidebar conversations

2496
02:02:47,200 --> 02:02:50,530
attempted to get some things started on

2497
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:54,370
the list without a whole lot of success

2498
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:56,320
but I do have a 74 82 bits

2499
02:02:54,370 --> 02:02:59,530
sitting on a machine you know right over

2500
02:02:56,320 --> 02:03:02,530
there and what I'm going to propose is

2501
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:04,360
that we take on this effort and if that

2502
02:03:02,530 --> 02:03:06,429
if we agree that we want to do that I

2503
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:08,620
will volunteer to do a little bit of cat

2504
02:03:06,430 --> 02:03:11,230
herding in terms of coming up with

2505
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:13,980
proposals for document authors and

2506
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:16,660
document shepherds and and whatnot so

2507
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:18,219
I'd like to ask the chairs in our ad if

2508
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:23,889
you think that this is work that we can

2509
02:03:18,220 --> 02:03:26,770
take on so thank you for that Scott and

2510
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:28,960
as folks might expect the 80s and the

2511
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:30,880
chairs have all had this discussion and

2512
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:32,590
we generally agree that this is good

2513
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:34,930
work to address with and that we should

2514
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:36,670
do this so it's just a matter of finding

2515
02:03:34,930 --> 02:03:38,470
the right means to do it there is a

2516
02:03:36,670 --> 02:03:40,390
question about our Charter and we'll

2517
02:03:38,470 --> 02:03:42,400
review that we might need a tweak to the

2518
02:03:40,390 --> 02:03:45,730
Charter we might not that's an open

2519
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:47,500
question but we think this is a good

2520
02:03:45,730 --> 02:03:49,150
good spot and this speaks to George

2521
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:50,260
mikaelsons issue which he has now left

2522
02:03:49,150 --> 02:03:52,269
the room and so he's not going to hear

2523
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:54,370
this this along with you know sort of

2524
02:03:52,270 --> 02:03:56,199
the j-card stuff all kind of fall on to

2525
02:03:54,370 --> 02:03:57,849
the are DAP side of our

2526
02:03:56,199 --> 02:04:03,329
work items so there's plenty of momentum

2527
02:03:57,849 --> 02:04:03,329
here going on on both sides so with that

2528
02:04:03,719 --> 02:04:18,219
Deb I drew you good at it any other

2529
02:04:10,150 --> 02:04:18,638
other business going once twice meeting

2530
02:04:18,219 --> 02:04:27,309
adjourned

2531
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:49,119
thank you all rick/vicki we'll help ya

2532
02:04:27,309 --> 02:04:51,039
before you duck out ooh she anybody see

2533
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:53,880

2534

there's one where's the other one

2535
