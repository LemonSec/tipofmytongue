1
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:42,120
how about well like this one is on now

2
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,779
right okay

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:01:00,929
it is 10 a.m. so it is time to start the

4
00:00:45,780 --> 00:01:06,810
NTP working group we have I can do with

5
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,300
this or high tech alright so we'll go

6
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,000
ahead and get started this is the NTP

7
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,979
working group we have a minute taker

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,170
thank you towel and we have a jabber

9
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:23,820
scribe thank you rich this is the note

10
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,869
well you will have agreed to it when you

11
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,758
register for the meeting and it still

12
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:35,940
applies if you have any questions feel

13
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:40,530
free to ask us or the eighties so this

14
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,450
is our agenda for the day we have and

15
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,340
we're at the administer the agenda

16
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:51,119
bassing portion of the session so this

17
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,840
there have been a number of changes from

18
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,369
what was posted into the data tracker so

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,569
we have to go back and update that a

20
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,959
little bit but there has already been

21
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:04,640
some bashing today any other agenda

22
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:11,160
bashing nope

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:14,190
all right so the first thing on the

24
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,870
agenda is a quick review of the NTP

25
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,430
working group status for the documents

26
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,239
that we won't be really discussing today

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,730
the first thing is that since the last

28
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,420
meeting we have requested publication of

29
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:31,260
two of our drafts the one on ntp packet

30
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:35,339
timestamps and the one on NTS so the

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:40,049
network time security draft thanks to

32
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:43,739
Brian Haberman we have the mode six

33
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,659
commands draft has been resurrected and

34
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,480
we're going to do a shepherd write-up on

35
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,109
that

36
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,738
we will do a really short confirmation

37
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,330
on the mailing list but I believe the

38
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:59,140
decision on this was to publish it as

39
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:04,230
historic and so that will be the plan

40
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:09,730
for that document any questions there

41
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:12,310
okay the next one is the young data

42
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,018
model this one is ready for working drug

43
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,069
last call does anybody have any

44
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,600
questions or comments on that we will

45
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,390
get that working group last call out

46
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,130
this week given the holidays and

47
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,059
everything we will make it a three week

48
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:29,530
working group last call and if you have

49
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,980
any questions now would be a good time

50
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:37,540
because the author is going to exit for

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:41,280
another meeting shortly all right so

52
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:45,459
there's no questions on that excellent

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,019
and then the remaining document that we

54
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,420
have that we won't be discussing more

55
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,910
detail later today is the inter leave

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:57,578
modes we did a working group last call

57
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:58,900
on that and that is still to be resolved

58
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:06,370
as to where we're moving with that

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:08,140
document all right so additionally that

60
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:14,049
we do have two documents that have been

61
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:17,260
adopted since the last meeting and one

62
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:21,160
is on rough time and the other one is on

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,740
the Chronos work that Mehta was doing

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,510
there are no updates for either of those

65
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,240
so my request to the working group would

66
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,590
be to start reviewing them so we have

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,930
agreed to develop these two documents

68
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,780
it's time to start making progress on

69
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:39,940
them any questions on these two

70
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:45,400
documents oh okay

71
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:47,490
so at this point the next document in

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,479
the queue was the port randomization

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,580
draft and I know that there was an

74
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,169
update to that I don't know we didn't

75
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,979
actually receive slides from Fernando I

76
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:02,469
know he's here

77
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,470
but I don't think he's in the room so

78
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:13,070
hard you don't think he's here why did I

79
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:15,289
think he was here be online okay well in

80
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,849
any event there has been a fair amount

81
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,700
of discussion of this draft and it has

82
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,290
been updated in advance of this meeting

83
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:25,450
so I would direct you to the mailing

84
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,450
list to discuss any further issues on it

85
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:37,930
and next is on implementing time yes

86
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:08,220
so this document sort of came out of a

87
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:11,840
internship that intraoral did with

88
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:17,669
enamelled loves to study the impact of

89
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:22,560
vulnerabilities of ntp on DNA send in a

90
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:26,580
check to do a impact study and we wish a

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,010
few things which vulnerabilities that

92
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,740
could have been mitigated within the

93
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:37,409
dienes of hair itself so the

94
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:43,260
applications did not use certain time

95
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:46,410
values correctly they did not choose the

96
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:53,900
right clock to schedule periods

97
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:56,880
basically this document is intended to

98
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:02,840
give some guidelines in how to do this

99
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:10,409
or two profiles inside in but different

100
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:15,419
this is what I just told you so you see

101
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:18,780
in the nest as the TTL for certain DMS

102
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:24,389
record it's a period we call this

103
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:27,059
relative time instead of a specific

104
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:32,400
point in time which we call a absolute

105
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,830
time and DNS software typically the not

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,280
not visual for parody image by nine

107
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:44,460
inbound antennas mask implemented this

108
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:47,549
as taking the current world clock point

109
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,880
of time and then adding the period to it

110
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:55,289
and scheduling the expiry date for that

111
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,740
point in time which made it fellow go

112
00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:01,909
for cash sticking attacks cash

113
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,910
exploration attacks

114
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:11,030
so that in the documents

115
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:14,120
it's the scope is to explain what kind

116
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:17,900
of methods there are to express time for

117
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,450
applications or the absolute point in

118
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,659
time versus their periods and the

119
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,810
different clocks that are maintained by

120
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:31,930
digital systems which may be used to

121
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:35,390
deal with those different time

122
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,000
mechanisms and what the trade-offs are

123
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,400
between using the one or the other and

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,520
that gives from guidance to help

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:52,160
implementers make informed choices from

126
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,750
the description in document on

127
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,680
implementation approaches in a example

128
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,260
you can get the different clock times

129
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:10,189
with a perfect system and a business

130
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:12,410
system so the research visuals that we

131
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,920
did the impact study on DNS was first

132
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:21,620
presented at the IP key two years ago

133
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:25,610
here in Singapore at the ITF 100 at the

134
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:29,030
same time we presented this draft trying

135
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:34,310
to provide guidance to application

136
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:39,800
implementers I think the written group

137
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,650
was or wanted to work on this but then

138
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,410
there was a sort of critique on the

139
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:49,069
terminology used in the draft at that

140
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:53,300
moment so we leave out the complete

141
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:57,340
terminology and made it to restricted to

142
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:01,400
be the bare minimum to describe a huge

143
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:09,950
which was presented one year later at

144
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:13,110
the ITF 103 in Bangkok and the I think

145
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:16,920
was received well by the working group

146
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:19,590
there were a few comments which I've

147
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,170
merged into the documents or addressed

148
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:33,600
in the document which was presented at

149
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:42,569
the last ITF in Montreal so this very

150
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:44,730
are now ok so between the last meaning

151
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,680
in this one we adopted this as a working

152
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,290
group draft

153
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:55,530
has anybody reviewed the draft that was

154
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:57,480
published anybody either any folks I

155
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,630
know that we are missing a number of our

156
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,600
regular working group participants at

157
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,100
this particular meeting are there

158
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,870
anybody is there anyone in the room

159
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,290
that's willing to commit to reviewing

160
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:16,230
this draft there we go

161
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:21,810
okay there's rich so we have three

162
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:24,960
volunteers so excellent thank you very

163
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:29,239
much social I submitted this a working

164
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,240
group document now yes please

165
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:10,209
so this is going to be a short review

166
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:15,230
about what is accomplished within NTS at

167
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:18,890
ITF 1.1 or Bundy started missing a cat

168
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:22,340
once the first hackathon for for the NTS

169
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:25,250
draft the first at that time it was

170
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,320
there were only two the proof of concept

171
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:31,840
implementation for Martin Allen from

172
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:37,520
tenure function and we had been

173
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:40,670
following hackathons in ITF 102 he

174
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:43,760
skipped one Osby and the man of Abia of

175
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:49,599
already had for implementation which

176
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:54,280
proved into about interoperability doing

177
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:57,980
the last two ITF meetings we had two

178
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:01,959
mini hackathon so to speak that have

179
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,090
been basically met not people who

180
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,810
implement who did work on there :

181
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:13,850
implementation of the NTS and this time

182
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:20,300
Krista was there to prepare scripts for

183
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:27,820
monitoring Santa's operation and to

184
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:27,819
write somehow tools and service wise

185
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:35,930
I've tried to to compile the list of

186
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:43,270
services NTS services already available

187
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:48,229
and at this table you will see six

188
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:50,770
available available NTS services the

189
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:54,200
first one from the University of

190
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:59,420
Australia which is basically Martin

191
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:02,900
langa then CloudFlare who was the first

192
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:06,740
to announce this actually and that net

193
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,220
not who announced that recently at my

194
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,820
place PDB we all all

195
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:17,260
always also having a test bed currently

196
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:22,660
running and the NTP SEC project has or

197
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:30,130
also an t-sne identity service and

198
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:32,860
there's also this NTP server in the last

199
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:40,840
line which I know don't know which

200
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:45,550
organization that is yeah these

201
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:50,710
disturbances are basically some are only

202
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:55,240
for testing purposes net node and

203
00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:01,560
anti-peace ik claims that something

204
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:04,210
between testing and production if I I

205
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,239
would be careful to use the word

206
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:13,020
production before the craft is finalized

207
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:24,810
actually but it's already quite stable

208
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:28,060
service then this this is a table of

209
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:33,459
github repositories which are available

210
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:42,819
for in TS implementations and here are

211
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:45,700
some more information about NTS some

212
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,580
some blocks by martin longer or by cloud

213
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:52,089
fair and not not how NTS is working and

214
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:57,310
how to use it and also by one one

215
00:15:52,089 --> 00:16:01,180
document by the NTP say project in which

216
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:07,989
they explain how to use an TS vista

217
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:13,180
implementation so I hope that useful for

218
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:18,310
those of you who want to do some testing

219
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:20,579
or plan to work this NTS are there any

220
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,579
questions

221
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,310
I rich soils Akamai um is it premature

222
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,380
to try to get this in the client-side

223
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,390
into any of the Linux distros do you

224
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,860
think into what any of the Linux

225
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,630
distributions have they expressed

226
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:47,870
interest or is it still too early do you

227
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:51,939
think to pick up a client-side I suppose

228
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:57,320
at least sent a s client is quite stable

229
00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:00,740
and the NTS part in the NTP SEC

230
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:06,020
forchette this already part of self

231
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:10,449
standard distribution so Webster there's

232
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,839
guy from NTP sit down here who can

233
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:13,839
elaborate on that

234
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:22,670
hi my name is Sanjeev and to be sick the

235
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:26,030
version which supports NDS is already in

236
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:28,030
the Debian distribution and downstream

237
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,230
of it as well it will be available in

238
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:34,250
the new version will be available in

239
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:37,340
1900 in 2004 in Ubuntu as well I'm not

240
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:41,210
sure about fedora also has NTP SEC but

241
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:43,129
their default client is Kony so I'm not

242
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,950
sure how many federal guys will install

243
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:49,400
NTP SEC or dokoni also has NDS support

244
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:53,840
so from the however this has to be

245
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,820
enabled so just having 90s compatible

246
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,649
client or server will not turn on NPS

247
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,649
administrators have to step in able it

248
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:18,730
any other questions did you know I have

249
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,610
talked a little bit about ongoing

250
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,730
activities to promote implementation and

251
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:28,360
deployment so we initially look to the

252
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:32,590
mailing list and as some of these

253
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:37,260
solidify we will make announcements or

254
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,260
point you to two appropriate directions

255
00:18:49,279 --> 00:19:01,440
so we put the NTP v 5 requirements on

256
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:05,730
here as a discussion item what we

257
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:18,080
currently have is a list of items in a

258
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:21,239
wiki in the NTP wiki so I don't know

259
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,249
some of the key folks that would help

260
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:30,539
leave this conversation are not here

261
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:36,600
this time so they I guess what my quite

262
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:39,919
my my ask to the working group is if you

263
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,439
go and you look at the NTP wiki

264
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,119
supported by the IETF there is a number

265
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,269
of NTP v4 issues that have been

266
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,399
identified and so we haven't committed

267
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:54,239
to doing an NTP v5 that would obviously

268
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,529
require more conversation within the

269
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,580
community but we are trying to gather

270
00:19:55,529 --> 00:20:03,330
the issues that we want to see solved

271
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:08,460
and so that work has begun at some level

272
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:18,449
and we should document it there so any

273
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:26,239
questions or comments Thomas are here is

274
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:26,239
there a time goal not yet it's really a

275
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,389
we had been resisting it for a while I

276
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,720
think we wanted to get into yes out the

277
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:37,859
door and so I think in the next meeting

278
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,809
or two well there is the there is a goal

279
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,658
in a sense that we have been talking for

280
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:44,249
quite a while about combining NTP and

281
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,649
tik-tok and chartering a single time

282
00:20:44,249 --> 00:20:50,909
working group so that is something that

283
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:54,258
that Suresh is smiling at me because

284
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:54,259
we've been talking about it for a while

285
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:03,760
right so and I think the context of

286
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,980
discussing that charter will also talk

287
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,570
about a timeline but I think it's one of

288
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,730
the challenges that I've found over the

289
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,409
years in this working group is there's a

290
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,440
lot of you know a lot of folks will tell

291
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,910
you what we should be doing but it's a

292
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,820
real challenge to get people to step

293
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,080
forward and write the documents and so

294
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,639
developing a timeline for NT p v5

295
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,159
without people that are willing to

296
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,760
actually write the documents is is a

297
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,130
challenge so I you know I think at this

298
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,590
point we're really trying to clear off

299
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,200
all of our things that we haven't gotten

300
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:41,199
done and get them out the door recharter

301
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,200
and then talk about a timeline so but in

302
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,940
the mean time I mean we had a fairly

303
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,140
robust conversation on this in our last

304
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:54,790
virtual interim and I think that doing

305
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,200
that in the context of I think it would

306
00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:00,340
be helpful to do to have those

307
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,750
conversations when you go ahead and

308
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,490
begin pulling the pieces together

309
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:07,480
identifying what we think we should

310
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:12,070
solve and said shouldn't solve but there

311
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,150
are a number of things that I think the

312
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,960
other thing was there was a number of

313
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,940
drafts that came through that the

314
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,650
feeling was we kept trying to tweak

315
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,210
things to fix them and before and the

316
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:23,980
real answer was we just needed to move

317
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:29,100
to a b5 and clean up some of the things

318
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,100
that were causing us issues

319
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:39,520
anyway so that work is beginning please

320
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:42,700
look at the wiki and go from there any

321
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,690
other questions on b5 this is going to

322
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,520
be the fastest ntp meeting in history so

323
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,080
go to the tick-tock working group status

324
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,290
so as I mentioned there is a tick-tock

325
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,600
working group and the plan for that

326
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:57,970
initially was that's the wrong

327
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,439
presentation you need to go the chair

328
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:04,440
slides I believe it's the first time

329
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,110
[Music]

330
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,110
yeah there you go

331
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:26,699
so the so the point the plan for the

332
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:31,190
tick-tock working group was to finish

333
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:34,830
the enterprise profile for the PTP

334
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:43,230
and close that working group in the

335
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:44,820
meantime Jose has has submitted an

336
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,600
update of the draft that he had

337
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,550
submitted previously unfortunately and I

338
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,080
do apologize to him I didn't actually

339
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:55,290
notice that that draft had been

340
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,480
submitted until early this morning so I

341
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:01,200
did not realize that there was updated

342
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,800
draft to discuss so the status of the

343
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,250
enterprise profile for PTP is that we

344
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,600
have we need to get it resubmitted and

345
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:14,400
then we need to do the Shepherd write-up

346
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,590
for it so we have the XML for that and

347
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,210
it'll be moving forward I'll talk a

348
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,990
little bit in a few minutes about the

349
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:25,260
status of PTP which is relevant to that

350
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:27,540
first Enterprise profile so the second

351
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:31,620
document that is on the tic-tock working

352
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,450
group is Jose's and I noticed that you

353
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,830
are online I don't know if you want to

354
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,220
get in the queue to talk a little bit

355
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,590
about what you've done in this update

356
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,870
and also notice that you have been

357
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,260
having audio issues so that might not be

358
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,260
possible

359
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:10,470
[Music]

360
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:15,540
go ahead as I I has to say that my draft

361
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:18,750
the update that we already done is we

362
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:24,690
changed the format of the time we use

363
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:28,049
now the dime Stang format of the NTP and

364
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:34,620
we have to arrange the document this is

365
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:40,379
a new word that we don't don't do for

366
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:45,750
for the moment but we are working little

367
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:49,440
slowly we have few or any comment for

368
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:56,070
for the moment I appreciate that if

369
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:58,799
there are some code the the central idea

370
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,139
of the draft is to propose another kind

371
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:05,820
of synchronization protocol different

372
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:08,970
for NTP it's more intended to

373
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:12,860
synchronize two end points we can

374
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:16,799
synchronize several the end points also

375
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:19,168
but the basis is different because we

376
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,710
send a packet for a second is different

377
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:25,770
from NTP and use this base on our

378
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:29,429
filtering method we can reach more

379
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:34,020
precision in the frequency and this is

380
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:37,790
why trying to illustrate in the Nexus we

381
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:42,090
we added and idea

382
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:46,770
the central point with Antibes when you

383
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:51,418
try to to get NTP server in some country

384
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:54,629
like Latin America or Africa it's very

385
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:59,190
difficult you are not 20 millisecond

386
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:03,390
away you are normally fast and further

387
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:05,490
than that this could be an option to

388
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:09,870
make synchronization

389
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:13,919
for clogs that the initial intention for

390
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:18,629
was to make some measurements in one one

391
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:23,580
wind delay in IPP working group and the

392
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:25,740
IPP say me that tik-tok what is that a

393
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,949
good group to present is rough this is

394
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,399
why I am arriving to to this working

395
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,539
group

396
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:42,110
well this is a very fast resume for for

397
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:42,110
the state design my sake thank you

398
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:51,750
so as as he as Jose has indicated he is

399
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,799
this is this is not ntp this is a

400
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,669
different type of synchronization

401
00:27:52,799 --> 00:28:00,570
mechanism was originally targeted at the

402
00:27:56,669 --> 00:28:06,299
tic-tock working group I think at this

403
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:08,970
point we would move it to the ntp

404
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:12,620
working group but we wouldn't adopt it

405
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,620
until we resolved the Charter issues

406
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:25,919
they however there have been a number of

407
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:30,539
updates and I think it would be helpful

408
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:33,450
if if folks would give it a review it's

409
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,770
only about 20 pages so it's not not too

410
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:36,659
terribly long

411
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:39,200
is there anybody that's willing to

412
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,200
review this document

413
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:52,360
couple of folks that were interested in

414
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:56,110
it or not it not in the room are not in

415
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:59,459
the room this morning so at that point

416
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:02,019
thank you very much Jose and we will

417
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:13,269
take this up at our next virtual meeting

418
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:23,350
okay all right the last thing on the

419
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:41,440
agenda is an update on 1588 I don't plan

420
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:43,149
to go into a I guess I should do the so

421
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,249
what I actually wanted to do is just

422
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:46,840
talk really quickly about 1588 because

423
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:49,330
we have been providing briefs over the

424
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,369
course of time about the status of 1588

425
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,779
and in particular the security work in

426
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:57,299
1588

427
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:57,299
so the basic timeline for this activity

428
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:05,189
so 1588 version 2 was published in 2008

429
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:08,799
and it included something called an XK

430
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:11,799
the other thing you'll note is the 1588

431
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:16,899
nib that we previously published was for

432
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:21,789
1588 version 2 so in 2013 we started the

433
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:22,989
par for the 1588 revision and in that

434
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:26,220
context there was a security

435
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,840
subcommittee that started working on it

436
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,610
the basis of the work for that security

437
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,168
subcommittee was the security

438
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:32,949
requirements document that was developed

439
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:38,259
here

440
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:41,200
RFC 73 84 we had originally thought that

441
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:43,659
the two solutions would be a little bit

442
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,340
closer we had originally thought we'd be

443
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,690
able to reuse the two solutions between

444
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,360
the two because there's still they're

445
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,740
both both basically packet time

446
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,939
synchronization protocols that seem like

447
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,429
they were similar enough that we would

448
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,950
be able to get some crossover that's not

449
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:59,510
not where we ended up but there's always

450
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:03,470
hope for the future

451
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:07,220
and just like in the last week or so the

452
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,630
revision 1588 version 2.1 was approved

453
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,160
for publication by the a triple-a

454
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,230
standards board so it will be moving

455
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,720
forward it'll be coming out probably in

456
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:18,410
early 2020 so you keep a lookout for

457
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,010
that so basically the security approach

458
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:24,200
that we use that was used in 1588 was to

459
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,150
include security and mechanisms and

460
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,030
guidance that can be used together or in

461
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,590
or individually and that the individual

462
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,510
mechanisms would be optional and one of

463
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:37,600
the real challenges was 1588 was the

464
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:39,350
number of different because the

465
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,879
constituents that would better so you

466
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,280
have the telecom community the

467
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,230
industrial automation community you have

468
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,280
a number of different communities like

469
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,630
that and they all have different

470
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,790
perspectives on what their security

471
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:54,230
solution should be and the mechanism

472
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:56,480
would be provided and then the

473
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,790
applications later it develops profiles

474
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,380
and based on those profiles profiles is

475
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,960
something that 1588 does in general it

476
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,820
does tailoring of the protocol for the

477
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,890
different communities based on using

478
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,220
profiles and so the idea is that we

479
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,180
would the same thing would happen for

480
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,260
security is that that different

481
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,260
communities would tailor them

482
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,660
differently basically it is a

483
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,980
multi-pronged approach which has

484
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:23,450
integrated security mechanism which was

485
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:25,130
added to version 2.1 an export external

486
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,550
transport security mechanisms which was

487
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,570
just some guidance talking about how

488
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,250
external mechanisms that might already

489
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,010
be in place could be used to help secure

490
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:37,850
PTP architectural guidance and

491
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,560
monitoring and maintenance so if you

492
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,899
look at the document there's going to be

493
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,270
a normative section an option that is

494
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,850
normative at sixteen dot fourteen which

495
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,470
is the mechanism itself and then there's

496
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:57,649
an access which is all of the security

497
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:59,600
material and so there is a a PPP packet

498
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,570
there's a TLB that's been defined that

499
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,340
includes the authentication top-4 for

500
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,070
security it's been added to the PTP

501
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:09,679
packet that's the rough idea of it right

502
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,500
there there that all of the key

503
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,390
management is currently left

504
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,340
outside the scope of this document so

505
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,690
there is some guidance on how to use

506
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,699
Tesla and there's some guidance on how

507
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,550
to use G DOI and they're used in

508
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,910
different context for the two different

509
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:29,090
approaches prong B is Mac second IPSec

510
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:31,000
as the two external security mechanisms

511
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,669
that we thought might might be present

512
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,350
and then redundancy is all of the

513
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,660
architecture guidance is provided and

514
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:41,959
then finally monitoring and management

515
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,370
guidance so all I really wanted to do

516
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,340
here was to sort of point out that this

517
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:48,409
work is ongoing it is kicking off now

518
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,659
that version 2.1 has been published

519
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:54,770
there is a plan to move forward and

520
00:33:50,660 --> 00:34:01,640
there is some thoughts of using NTS in

521
00:33:54,770 --> 00:34:04,879
some form where it would be able to be

522
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:07,790
reused to help the 1588 security pieces

523
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,870
so that was my quick update on 1588

524
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:14,659
since I've been talking about it before

525
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:16,670
siddhis Krishnan so uh the is idly

526
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:19,190
expecting some kind of guidance from us

527
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:21,070
for the use of IP ii stuff like that or

528
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,060
they got it covered

529
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:25,040
they're not actually expecting any

530
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:28,549
guidance what the way that that

531
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:32,000
particular that prong B was developed

532
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,760
was two different communities came

533
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,830
forward and said this is how we're using

534
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,960
IPSec in the context of in the in that

535
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:41,270
particular case it was that industrial

536
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,010
automation types of applications so it

537
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,469
wasn't so much how should it be used it

538
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,030
was more like how how are the systems

539
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:50,870
that we are currently deploying are

540
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:52,550
using this technology now so and it's a

541
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,170
really pretty lightweight section it's

542
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,480
not providing a lot of specific guidance

543
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,880
on how to use it as much as it's saying

544
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,440
that there is probably security

545
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,440
mechanisms that exist in your in your

546
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,520
system and you need to think about a how

547
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,310
they interact with your time

548
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,450
synchronization because a lot of times

549
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:10,549
folks deploy things and they don't think

550
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,160
in the context of the impact that the

551
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,380
security that exists all around it it

552
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:19,549
has on the synchronization capabilities

553
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:21,290
itself so so I thought it could be

554
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,760
useful you know if I caught somebody

555
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,290
from the city area to like take a look

556
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,599
at it and see if there's something off

557
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:29,300
but if like they don't want it it's fine

558
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:30,349
no not at this point because it just got

559
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,560
approved for publication

560
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:35,930
I have run it by individual security

561
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,700
experts in the IETF but I haven't run it

562
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,819
through the security area officially

563
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:43,819
because that's fine like it if we can

564
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,200
help but right I would be glad to help

565
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,790
but yeah that's fine yeah that'd be

566
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,560
great and in it as you know there are

567
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:54,140
issues with the accessibility of this

568
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,460
document yes um I could be a better so

569
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,049
anyway that's all I really wanted to do

570
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,220
is to provide you a quick snapshot we've

571
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,050
been talking about it previously and

572
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,359
then also to point out that there is

573
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,670
some thought about how NTS might be used

574
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:06,650
in this context if you go back to some

575
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,230
of the original documents around NTS we

576
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,510
had a general NTS specification and the

577
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,940
thought was the IETF would develop you

578
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:16,910
know NTS for NTP and I Triple E would

579
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:21,020
develop NTS for 1588 that's not where we

580
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,549
ended up but I think there's moving

581
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,890
forward there's still some places where

582
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:30,140
we can reuse technology which would be

583
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:32,359
really helpful so with that I think

584
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:35,650
we're at the end of our agenda and quite

585
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:38,619
possibly the fastest ntp meeting ever

586
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,670
with area directors are happy about that

587
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:44,690
the one thing I did want to talk about

588
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,700
was virtual interns going forward we had

589
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,660
planned last time to do two we managed

590
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:52,609
execute on one I think virtual interims

591
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:56,270
really helped us keep a pulse of getting

592
00:36:52,609 --> 00:37:00,440
our work done so given that we're coming

593
00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:03,740
up into the holidays we will probably be

594
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,480
looking at one in early to mid January I

595
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:09,439
think probably December is going to be a

596
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,970
little bit too too early and there's a

597
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,760
whole bunch of new documents that need

598
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,828
review so please please PLEASE start

599
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,250
reviewing these documents and comment on

600
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:22,450
the mailing list and with that any other

601
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,450
questions comments

602
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,288
there you go we are adjourned
