00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,219
[Music]

4
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,470
okay everybody it's a half pass so let's

5
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:34,920
start finding our seats and get started

6
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:36,750
so as you can see the the first thing we

7
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,859
want to we want to remind everybody

8
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:45,300
about is that is the you note well and

9
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,100
agenda bash so here's the agenda please

10
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:55,230
take a glance at this if you would like

11
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:57,690
to bash it and here is the note well so

12
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,329
please read this note well take special

13
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,590
note that the note well includes

14
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,500
reminders to behave appropriately in

15
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:18,989
this working group we'll come back to

16
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:19,520
that a little louder please if there are

17
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:22,880
no agenda

18
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,290
then we'll move on with the rest of the

19
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:29,450
agenda just a couple of quick notes so

20
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,100
I'm David Lawrence this is Ben Schwartz

21
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,380
we will be co-chairing this working

22
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,570
group forming buff but I also wanted to

23
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,519
thank Tim woods in ski and Joe Lorenzo

24
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,470
hall for being our note takers on the

25
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,600
etherpad if you'd like to follow along

26
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,850
to make any Corrections as you go that

27
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:51,650
will also be helpful and Susanne wolf

28
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:54,190
will be our chapter scribe thank you so

29
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,360
just in case everybody doesn't have

30
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,730
isn't coming in with the same

31
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,250
understanding of how we got to where we

32
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:05,030
are the chairs thought we would start

33
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,440
off with a quick review of of the past

34
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,700
couple of years of developments in this

35
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,940
area so over the past four years there

36
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,380
have been two major standards

37
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,600
development efforts that have created

38
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:21,290
new encrypted protocols for DNS so

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,560
here's the timeline from 2014 to 2018 of

40
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:29,660
the development of DNS over TLS and DNS

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,820
over HTTP those began to get significant

42
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:35,170
client of a client implementation

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:38,810
starting last year in 2018 so here's

44
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:40,970
again a timeline of a few of the notable

45
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,810
client implementations we just yesterday

46
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,120
had a very very important announcement

47
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,050
of another in client implementation in

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:57,440
the form of Microsoft Windows so this

49
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:58,730
list is now even more incomplete over

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,880
the past few years there have also been

51
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:04,940
a very large number of server

52
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,440
deployments and trial deployments I've

53
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,940
tried to break these up into a few

54
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,230
different categories but if you if you

55
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,730
look down this list you'll see quite a

56
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,580
wide range of different kinds of

57
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:16,250
entities that are operating these

58
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,650
servers and likely trying to achieve

59
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:24,919
different kinds of purposes using the

60
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:28,659
same underlying protocols just this year

61
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:32,570
there have been a large number of drafts

62
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,419
presented to the various working groups

63
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,000
related to

64
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,099
configuration of DNS client so I

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,159
certainly won't go through all of these

66
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:45,509
here but all of these are drafts

67
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:48,270
introduced this year that that affect

68
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:51,650
how DNS clients are configured I suspect

69
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,419
there are more that I've missed here and

70
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,370
and there may well be more coming a

71
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,438
couple of these will be presented today

72
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,240
only one of them I believe is currently

73
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:04,800
adopted by a working group one thing I'd

74
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,379
really like to point out here too is

75
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,180
though a lot of the discussion that's

76
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,099
been going on has centered around DNS

77
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,560
over HTTPS you can see from these graphs

78
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:15,539
that we are not just talking about DNS

79
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,319
over HTTPS we are talking about the

80
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,789
evolving DNS landscape and it is not

81
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,860
restricted by any stretch of the

82
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:27,300
imagination to only doe they're also

83
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,259
been several drafts that are less

84
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,439
focused on on client configuration and

85
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:38,759
more focused on systemic issues that are

86
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:41,430
a result of either DNS over HTTP

87
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,129
deployment or other interesting changes

88
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,370
over the over the past years in the way

89
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:49,469
that DNS is deployed these also this has

90
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,039
been a set of drafts that have come up

91
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:52,770
this year

92
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:57,779
none of these are currently adopted in a

93
00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:00,508
working group this year there have been

94
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,279
a number of controversies regarding this

95
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,120
topic I'm not going to talk through

96
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:08,099
these I'm mostly surfacing these example

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,219
headlines from the press as a way to

98
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:13,169
remind people to be respectful with your

99
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:16,589
comments during this session that this

100
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:20,669
is a very charged space and we'd like to

101
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:26,159
try to be focused and and productive and

102
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:29,279
cordial and the purpose of our

103
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:31,589
conversation today is to discuss forming

104
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,949
a working group this is a working group

105
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:39,900
forming buff this is not a standards

106
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:42,029
development meeting so we are not we are

107
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,638
not debating the merits of particular

108
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:46,550
standards proposals and we are

109
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,700
definitely not here to argue

110
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,620
about controversies in the press and the

111
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:58,190
session is very short only 90 minutes

112
00:07:51,620 --> 00:08:08,150
total so so so please try to be brief I

113
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:09,800
will also try to be brief if I remember

114
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:15,200
the agenda right am I am I in the right

115
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:20,360
order here okay then our our next

116
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,039
session is I believe 10 minutes our next

117
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,790
segment is 10 minutes for presentation

118
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,440
and discussion of a proposal by Mozilla

119
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,210
I want to emphasize that this is not a

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,100
standards development meeting the

121
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,069
purpose of these presentations here is

122
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:38,060
to provide us with some examples of the

123
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:40,220
kinds of work that a working group might

124
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,010
adopt if a working group is formed but

125
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:46,640
we are not here to to talk through a

126
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:49,130
full discussion of these of any

127
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,810
standards proposals here thank you Andy

128
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,170
all right I think you think you did the

129
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,640
chairs yeah so this is um this is less

130
00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:01,750
of a proposal right now and more of just

131
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,750
kind of like a more of a rapport and

132
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,550
explanation of our current experience

133
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:13,570
with rolling out dough and particularly

134
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:18,579
the use of or calling a canary domain so

135
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:22,420
so Mozilla has taken a inclusive

136
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:26,270
position in terms of enabling go for us

137
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,740
users of our products now that one of

138
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,240
the side effects well there's a couple

139
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,660
of different side effects which I'm sure

140
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,560
a lot of you are aware of but

141
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,689
consequences of us doing that is that we

142
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,489
were working to mitigate those as much

143
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,100
as possible so one of the things that

144
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,870
application-based dns does is it

145
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,330
bypasses any sort of dns based parental

146
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:53,000
controls that are present on the network

147
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:55,580
so what we want to do is to detect when

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,930
a network has those even a CMS based

149
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,080
parental controls present and then

150
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,699
disabled Oh on the assumption that

151
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,500
the presence of those parental controls

152
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:08,660
or pulse whatever policies there is

153
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,200
wanted by the network operator and is

154
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,480
probably more important than then that

155
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,270
something day one and it's supersedes

156
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,860
the importance of dome for the user so

157
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,500
we have a lot of different heuristics

158
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,210
that we're using to work on this issue

159
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,690
to work on some of the other issues but

160
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:30,770
I'm going to be talking about the like

161
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:35,060
marry for parental controls so the big

162
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:43,390
the first issue is that is to detect DNS

163
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:43,390
based parental controls and it's not

164
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,089
it's not good to like take a

165
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,840
experimental approach and like try to

166
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:56,420
trigger this for actual domains because

167
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,950
that I think it's kind of sub obvious

168
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,050
but you know if there's logging or

169
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,760
something like that these are these if

170
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,790
they're explicit domains then we don't

171
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,610
want the user to be tagged as having

172
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,170
visited them when they actually happened

173
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,110
it's their it's their software that's

174
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,430
doing that so what we tried to do

175
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:17,480
instead or what we're trying to do

176
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:20,390
instead is to designate a safe canary

177
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,540
domain so canary domain canary in the

178
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:25,040
sense that like the if anybody is

179
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,099
familiar with the canary in the coalmine

180
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,209
it's like something not directly related

181
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,370
to the thing that you're trying to

182
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,510
determine but it's a strong indicator of

183
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:36,650
of the finger your finder determines so

184
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:40,010
see if the canary dies and then you know

185
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:45,459
that that that's the case so so the

186
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:47,990
disadvantage of this is that it requires

187
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,470
whoever's running the policy to actually

188
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,930
do something proactive to enable to

189
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,820
block this additional domain as opposed

190
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,979
to just relying on whatever the you know

191
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,280
the current settings up there of their

192
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,980
of their software so we tried to make

193
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,030
that as easy as possible to do but the

194
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,860
the the essence of it is that if you

195
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,020
visit if if the browser or tries to

196
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,670
resolve the domain and it gets a blocked

197
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,090
or modified results

198
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:19,310
then we deduced that that means that the

199
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:23,090
that epic DNS policy is present and we

200
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,719
disabled though so then there can be you

201
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,070
can have multiple community drains so

202
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,560
obviously you don't really want that

203
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,790
many because it's kind of a pain to keep

204
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,380
track of them and make sure that your

205
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,569
you're heading them all so that's kind

206
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:38,120
of one of the reasons to be here is to

207
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,500
if you have a global or a more common

208
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,350
Canary domain than then you don't have

209
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:49,100
to hit one for ISP a through Z sort of

210
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:56,480
thing so the name of our code our domain

211
00:12:49,100 --> 00:13:00,020
is used application DNS net so in as we

212
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,380
roll outs making those the defaults we

213
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:06,170
resolve this using the platform DNS and

214
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,410
if there's an error that comes back or

215
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,630
if there's a success result but it

216
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,969
doesn't contain an A or quad a result

217
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,380
then we take that as being a positive

218
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,680
indication the Canary domain is

219
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,320
triggered and disabled though so this

220
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,089
requires some work on the server side or

221
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,290
in the network side to enable that and

222
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,970
we try to make that as easy as possible

223
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,480
so if you're using parental control

224
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,900
software then presumably there's some

225
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,600
easy-to-use UI to to flag domains and

226
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,390
we've also talked to some parental

227
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,070
control software providers and that's

228
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:42,800
something that they're interested in and

229
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,940
adding and sometimes just like hey we're

230
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,449
interested in doing this they're like oh

231
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,230
we already blocked it okay so if you're

232
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:53,720
using by nine then the use of a response

233
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,480
policy zone was a good way to do it and

234
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,950
we also heard from other when we started

235
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,380
talking about this and blogging about

236
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,500
this we heard from some people using

237
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,240
other DNS servers where so our initial

238
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,890
approach was to just treat an X domain

239
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,680
as triggering the canary and we've

240
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,720
changed that so that any error results

241
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,089
and any success result besides that

242
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,380
didn't return any or quad-a was to make

243
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,990
some kind of make it easier for whatever

244
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,140
your software is to to engage the canary

245
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:25,079
domain if you want to

246
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:28,360
so piehole has added support for it and

247
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,130
just kind of my sense is that people are

248
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,170
aware of it and we have an email address

249
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,579
where people are like commenting on

250
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,880
their use of it and it seems like it's

251
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:38,739
some getting getting some getting some

252
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,920
uptake

253
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,720
we're running studies but we've been run

254
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,449
we've been running a lot of studies are

255
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,920
leading up to the decision to roll out

256
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:51,040
dough and we continue to do that and

257
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,620
looking at the heuristics and the the

258
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,560
percentages of users that that are

259
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,170
disabling dough or would have dough

260
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,719
disabled if depending on the very

261
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,189
various heuristics and we're seeing

262
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,300
we're seeing non amounts non-trivial

263
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:10,000
amounts of of triggering the canary

264
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,430
domain so a contrary to what the slide

265
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,160
says I just got an update this morning

266
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,069
so Firefox this is only in the United

267
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,110
States but dough has rolled out to 1% of

268
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,120
the users and is going to be rolling out

269
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:27,820
to another 1% of the users very soon so

270
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,070
we're continuing to monitor all the

271
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,100
heuristics but the canary domain usage

272
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:37,060
via lemon tree and one thing that we're

273
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,880
concerned about is that it's really

274
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,640
based upon what the end network operator

275
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,390
has decided that they want to do rather

276
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:50,319
than some higher-level network operator

277
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,420
so we're watching for abuse and making

278
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,060
making sure that the canary domain

279
00:15:52,420 --> 00:16:01,479
blocking is at the end end customer

280
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:04,000
level so here's a couple pre-emptive why

281
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,630
didn't use why didn't you wait for

282
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,310
Standardization well we floated a

283
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,470
extremely flimsy trial balloon about six

284
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:16,630
months ago but we really needed a

285
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:18,970
solution quickly and we especially when

286
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,370
we came to the conclusion that we are

287
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,320
going to require people to add something

288
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,959
or change their configuration in the

289
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:29,500
network some way that we make that as

290
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:30,880
easy as possible and we couldn't we

291
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,910
wanted to make that as easy and as fast

292
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,560
as possible and avoid any sort of

293
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,790
new versions or anything like that which

294
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,369
was kind of some of the initial feedback

295
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,260
was well why don't you you know there

296
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,660
was kind of more expansive maybe better

297
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:46,150
solutions but that would have required

298
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,160
those software changes but we really

299
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,230
needed something pretty quickly the

300
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,500
other piece of technical feedback that

301
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,560
we received is that instead of looking

302
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,930
at a positive results or a positive

303
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,189
result being the canary domain fan and

304
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,170
resolved that it should be the positive

305
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:07,360
canary result should be the canary

306
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:09,250
design domain resolving so that didn't

307
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,250
seem to be quite as good to us for the

308
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,020
two reasons listed there that that was

309
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,369
kind of like a little bit I mean if you

310
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,930
just like if you have a parental control

311
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,399
solution and then you just add another

312
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,340
thing to the block list that's like a

313
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,960
very natural thing to do as opposed to

314
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,909
as opposed to having the logic be the

315
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,700
opposite way and the other piece of that

316
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:31,290
is that the NX domain substitution can

317
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,290
cause trouble with that approach as well

318
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,320
so that's basically it

319
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,350
we've kind of done this thing on our own

320
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:44,080
seems to be working but it is kind of a

321
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,149
unilateral thing and we'd like to to

322
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,060
look at at sanitization and seeing if

323
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:51,880
they'd be useful for other people and

324
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,070
that we could move off that and to more

325
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,490
more standard things so increased

326
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:00,610
adoption would be good fewer canary

327
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:04,300
domains will be good that would make it

328
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:06,429
easier for applications we also were a

329
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,220
little bit stymied by you know having to

330
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,690
have an actual like the dotnet whereas

331
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,100
you know if you could be an if it could

332
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,630
be in a reserved domain then that might

333
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,270
be that might be nicer so we're

334
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:22,570
interested in working on on a candidate

335
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:24,580
for production so turdy one quick

336
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,409
clarifying question then one comment the

337
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,330
clarifying question is it appeared from

338
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,810
what you were saying that this logic has

339
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:34,030
only invoked if dough is present because

340
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,770
of the default if user is configured a

341
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,670
dough server would you use the same

342
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:41,860
logic no if someone configures dough on

343
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,780
than it is just on thank you thank you

344
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,600
for the clarification the other point I

345
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,779
wanted says for possible reserved names

346
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,119
the IAB is made

347
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:54,109
under DARPA available under much less

348
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:55,629
difficult processes than reserved TLT so

349
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:57,830
you may want to consider whether your

350
00:18:55,629 --> 00:19:01,399
reserved domain actually needs to be a

351
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,840
TLD to do its function oh yeah we were

352
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:04,340
thinking something under DARPA would be

353
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,499
thanks for the clarification on that as

354
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:12,619
well thanks Brian Dixon GoDaddy excuse

355
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:16,070
me you were mentioning that this is one

356
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:17,959
of several heuristics I was wondering if

357
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,089
you would be willing to publish or share

358
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,509
those and maybe standardize Ogle's as

359
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:31,158
well well we had there implemented via a

360
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:34,419
plugin which we've made public so is

361
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:39,589
that sufficient or I mean we could sure

362
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:41,299
thanks so just to sharpen that point we

363
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:43,279
do publish what the I mean so they

364
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:45,619
published in several ways we have a blog

365
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,440
post describes what they do and we have

366
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:51,049
a and then of course the source code for

367
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,690
the this is all this is run by a web

368
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:55,908
extension public so you can see directly

369
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,749
what they do um unfortunately they're

370
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,009
probably not really suitable for

371
00:19:56,749 --> 00:19:59,419
Standardization because they involve

372
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:01,369
because they're basically looking at

373
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:04,759
operating system api's looking to see

374
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:06,978
whether someone is configuring on you

375
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,570
know a firefox universe firefox

376
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:10,669
properties so I'm not really

377
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,769
standardized herbal um though I'm

378
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,929
certainly there's been conversations

379
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:17,359
about the operating system is exposing

380
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:18,799
some API that indicated that the user

381
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,849
had made conscious choices like it

382
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,349
didn't like go or some like that our

383
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:22,489
protocol tools were on and I said that's

384
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:26,178
that's a potential area for

385
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:28,549
Standardization yeah the more techniques

386
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:29,929
rather than yeah but I was probably bit

387
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,309
that that to be driven by the operating

388
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,580
system vendors rather than might rather

389
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:35,749
than by their consumers up right before

390
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,039
you go I just want to remind everybody

391
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:40,669
this is just an informational session

392
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,869
and so quick comments because to keep on

393
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:45,049
the agenda we're gonna have to move on

394
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:48,439
to the next presentations and my atoms

395
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:52,309
from ICANN I'll I'll keep it short the

396
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:56,960
canary domain is use application DNS net

397
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:58,999
it's a to label domain in binds I need

398
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,630
to use as an operator I need to use now

399
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:02,700
policy zones

400
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,100
it would be much simpler much more

401
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:10,500
straightforward if I can configure a

402
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:14,750
zone let's say use application DNS

403
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,299
dotnet and deny the existence of X dot

404
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:20,429
use application DNS dotnet in order to

405
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:22,830
deny it now I either need to use added

406
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:25,139
policy zone which is kind of complex or

407
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,750
I need to locally configure the net zone

408
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:29,610
in order to deny use application DNS

409
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,130
dotnet so may I suggest to make that

410
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,668
domain and have another label in front

411
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,990
of it if that makes any sense if if you

412
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:42,480
need more clarification and we could

413
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:46,830
take this off Mike okay spill new

414
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:50,879
horizon it's a little of a problem to do

415
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:53,580
parental control okay I have another

416
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:55,860
problem about parental control doing it

417
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,049
to BIA DNS at the first place I think

418
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,529
it's not full I get to parental control

419
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:03,450
by a DNS in the first place yeah so I'm

420
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:06,779
not quite sure at all you should really

421
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:09,059
help to do things the wrong way by

422
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:11,460
bringing this forward what's first the

423
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:14,129
commit yeah what people are doing it so

424
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:20,700
yeah doesn't mean that we need to

425
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:22,918
support them kind of do David's cannot

426
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,970
see there it's cannot see Google Chrome

427
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:29,490
this Mike is sorry I just wanted to

428
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,899
share that there is so for stuff this

429
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,610
makes sense to me but also there is

430
00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:38,309
precedent the ITF has standardized ipv4

431
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,029
only dot our pub and it's kind of

432
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:45,090
similar to this where by spec it exists

433
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:47,850
to only return to a records and nothing

434
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:50,879
else and operators override those

435
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:53,370
results to share with clients that there

436
00:22:50,879 --> 00:22:56,090
is a dns64 and an at six four on the

437
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:59,090
network so we have precedent for

438
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,610
specifically using dns as a way to say

439
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:04,590
hey you override this you by overriding

440
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:06,779
this you get the functionality you want

441
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,840
so this seems very similar it makes

442
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:10,510
sense to me yeah

443
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,459
and with apologies I'm closing the mic

444
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:17,680
line because Tommy can you come up for

445
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:22,780
your presentation while he's walking go

446
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:26,110
okay all right Iranian run from Google

447
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,230
Android one just comment I found a

448
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:31,479
little confusing is that so the whole

449
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,160
presentation focuses on basically the

450
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,500
usage for permits on control but I don't

451
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,700
see anything in particular that I mean

452
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,710
for me the parents on culture is just

453
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,930
like one subset of censorship basically

454
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,850
and I don't see anything in here that

455
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,590
you know it's specific to pirate or

456
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,469
control compared to like in general

457
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:50,709
whatever you could use for censorship in

458
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:52,930
general and so considering that I think

459
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,690
you know in further communication it

460
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,880
might be better to like refer to the

461
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,520
general concepts unless there's like

462
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,260
some measure that that makes it so you

463
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,639
can only use it for parental control

464
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:08,770
only well yeah it's a we we've been it's

465
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,360
like a it's a DNS policy so it's

466
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,260
commonly used for parental control but

467
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,800
it could yeah you're right it could be

468
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:31,270
used for for other things by right my

469
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:35,169
other entities all right hello everyone

470
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:36,430
I'm Tommy Pali from Apple so in light of

471
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,430
the fact that this is you know

472
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:41,500
information over you guys there's you

473
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:43,900
know two sides of this one is to share

474
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,790
some of the work that we are doing at

475
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,320
Apple as a kind of an operating

476
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:49,060
system-level thing we have a lot of

477
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,780
experience of people trying to do dough

478
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,330
in the browser

479
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,180
right now you know we have people

480
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,040
looking at how to do it as an operating

481
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,600
system service in the system resolver

482
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,450
we've done a lot of good feedback

483
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,629
already on this also from the teams at

484
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:07,660
Android as well as the Microsoft Windows

485
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:10,630
DNS teams so part of us is to share this

486
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,010
information but then hopefully also be

487
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,500
kind of the questions we're trying to

488
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,450
address in this as we're working on

489
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,060
design architecture are some of the

490
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,310
things that if ABCD is a group it would

491
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,810
likely come up and so

492
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,060
right now these are a couple documents

493
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,340
that we have put forward in deprived and

494
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,830
so we'll be presenting those later in

495
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,600
the week if you think that there was

496
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,520
make sense in deprived then that maybe

497
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,209
influence kind of like where we see this

498
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,740
particular group going alright so we

499
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,720
have this overall thing we're calling it

500
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,050
adaptive DNS privacy so what does it

501
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,210
mean so here we have the normal status

502
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:48,580
quo DNS setup and when we look at the

503
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:51,010
different parties involved we have our

504
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,990
client device it's talking to some local

505
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,450
resolver generally at least a locally

506
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:59,040
provisioned resolver using standard DNS

507
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:01,480
over UDP port 53 and then there's some

508
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,050
actual origin server that I'm connecting

509
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,600
to example comm so what we've seen with

510
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,710
a lot of the doe deployments so far is

511
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,800
something that's a little bit more like

512
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,290
this we are you know potentially

513
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,230
skipping that first step and we have

514
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:20,230
some other external public for cursive

515
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,710
Doe that we're using instead to replace

516
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,700
that role so that achieves some goals I

517
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,560
think people are doing this because of

518
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,660
privacy but it also has other concerns

519
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:33,010
that have been clearly brought up on the

520
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:35,530
ad D list and others so when I look at

521
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:36,760
this from the point of view of the

522
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,760
operating system there's a couple of

523
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,320
different questions that come to mind

524
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,120
and I want to go through those what

525
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,210
we're thinking here as some of the

526
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,969
prompts for this group so first how do

527
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:52,320
we as a client discover the different

528
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,280
encrypted resolvers that are available

529
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,040
not necessarily when to use them with

530
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,810
just their existence next how do we

531
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,159
understand the local policy of the

532
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,370
network that's kind of like the canario

533
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,780
domain that we just saw and then kind of

534
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,250
the big one if we're doing this at a

535
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,260
system level and not just in a browser

536
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,550
like how do we know as a client what are

537
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,080
the right things to use at the right

538
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,899
times because there can be some very

539
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,010
complex scenarios going on so I'm gonna

540
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,980
go through all three of these and that

541
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:21,070
will be the talk so first how do we

542
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,420
discover different resolvers so there's

543
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:24,669
a couple of different options I think

544
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:28,060
what we're seeing today oftentimes we

545
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:29,980
have some hard-coded lists of things

546
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,310
that we've white listed and audited in

547
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,990
that's one approach certainly you can

548
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,760
also there have been proposals to

549
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,160
like bootstrapping off of an HTTP

550
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,840
connection I'm you almost like an alt

551
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,610
service type thing that you connect you

552
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,379
learn that this thing supports doe and

553
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,840
then in the future you start using doe

554
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,640
from a privacy perspective that's not

555
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,800
necessarily great because it's very

556
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,010
opportunistic it's a little bit lazy on

557
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,290
that regard so what we're proposing here

558
00:27:54,010 --> 00:28:00,670
this is just one option is actually

559
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:03,480
using records in the DNS ideally DNS sex

560
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:07,510
signed records that can prove some

561
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:10,720
official designation of what a zone

562
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,400
wants to use as its associated trust the

563
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,490
resolver the point of this is saying

564
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,640
that if I'm going to a Google domain

565
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,950
then it's probably appropriate to use a

566
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,179
Google resolver it'll have accurate

567
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,960
results it will allow us to do

568
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:28,360
connection coalescing and it actually

569
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,190
kind of makes this it reduces the number

570
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,689
of parties that are involved in this

571
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:35,860
overall system which is a good privacy

572
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:37,150
benefit and it just as a quick aside

573
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,620
here we know one of the things of course

574
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,290
that's been coming up is the choice of

575
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,120
protocol and so I want to explain why

576
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:45,659
we're talking about doe here even though

577
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,809
of course you know dot is available

578
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:53,080
oftentimes the choice of doe is being

579
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:55,030
described as a you know a way to hide

580
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,010
the traffic to make it invisible that

581
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,570
we're doing DNS resolution that maybe

582
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,830
some people school but I think in this

583
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,530
case there are a lot of other benefits

584
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,300
of doe that I do want to highlight it

585
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:08,020
allows us to do multiplexing and if we

586
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,700
are indeed doing resolution of Google

587
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:12,280
names to Google servers there's a much

588
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,350
higher chance that we're going to end up

589
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,570
seeing coalescing and getting benefit of

590
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,000
multiplexing it also allows us to get

591
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:22,980
more of a direct transition to quick we

592
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,780
can go from HTTP to to HTTP 3 without

593
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,059
redefining a protocol mapping it also

594
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:31,389
allows proxying requests which I'll get

595
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:33,820
into a bit later so essentially the

596
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,380
world with a designated DNS service a

597
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,240
designated dose over kind of looks like

598
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,860
this we still have our local resolver

599
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,440
but we're also aware that there is a

600
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,199
designation for example.com to a certain

601
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,310
resolver that may be a public resolver

602
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,600
that's handling its resolution

603
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,550
so then we also want to look at how do

604
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,340
we handle local policy that's being

605
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:56,760
advertised so again we have options like

606
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,679
doing canary domains this is I think a

607
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,240
really good first step although maybe

608
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,450
it's not the long term architecture that

609
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,150
we want you can also put things in DHCP

610
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:08,880
or RA options what we're doing right

611
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:12,630
here is using something that we are it's

612
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,340
in tension off of off of Ras called

613
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,880
provisioning domains it allows us to

614
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,970
fetch a fairly large blob that's fetched

615
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:24,390
off of a HTTPS connection is a JSON blob

616
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,440
that's a bit flexible here and we

617
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,740
imagine that this type of information

618
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,290
can be used to indicate walled garden

619
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,750
status captive status as well as

620
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,879
filtering rules and so it's essentially

621
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,830
how do I use this network what are the

622
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,080
things that are available and one of the

623
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,970
important things here also is the even

624
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,870
in cases in which I'm allowed to use DOE

625
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:48,810
to public services we may want to break

626
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,750
out certain services locally so you know

627
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,090
I have Comcast as my ISP and if I have

628
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,740
local Xfinity streaming services that

629
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,790
are very well optimized it'd be great to

630
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,230
do my dns and ideally do-- to Comcast

631
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:03,690
over the local network the same goes for

632
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,520
enterprise network scenarios in which we

633
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,250
need to know kind of like the split DNS

634
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,480
world here so we need to be very

635
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:15,840
cognizant of split DNS as we are doing

636
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,040
this solution for local networks so we

637
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,810
kind of get a world like this in which

638
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,950
we have different DOE servers hanging

639
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:24,149
about this is can just be for reference

640
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,470
this is the type of thing that we're

641
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:30,390
currently defining that the local

642
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:33,480
network can indicate we as we had some

643
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:34,920
discussions with various ISPs and I

644
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,050
think we're gonna have scenarios in

645
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,250
which we have some required filtering in

646
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,510
which it's like oh let's say I have a

647
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,010
school environment this really needs to

648
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,960
be locked down and essentially

649
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:45,210
indicating ahead of time we will block

650
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,670
you if you try to evade this and like

651
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:49,770
that's going to be bad news but you can

652
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,600
also have things that are more opt-in

653
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:54,389
services of saying this is a parental

654
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,929
controls that's nice to do but if the

655
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:59,400
user does specify a specific dose server

656
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,999
they want to use as an override or if

657
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,589
they're in some private browsing mode

658
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:04,209
they would be allowed to go and the

659
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,129
network wouldn't actively block those

660
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:10,629
connections so be good to know that type

661
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:12,579
of stance as well and lastly the draft

662
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,198
that we have the adaptive DNS one talks

663
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:15,609
a lot about the client algorithm for

664
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:17,529
what's the right thing to use I think

665
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:19,208
this is going to be at the heart of a

666
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:22,599
lot of stuff that may come up in this

667
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:23,769
often in this group so here's like a

668
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:25,119
little flowchart of kind of the

669
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:27,009
precedents of how we would follow

670
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,289
through things because we need to take

671
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:32,039
into account things like VPNs that like

672
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:34,658
we must do first we don't want to have

673
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:36,009
the idea of DOE servers kind of

674
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:39,279
overriding things that we have this

675
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:41,409
enterprise type policy we also want to

676
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,599
make sure that we do highly respect the

677
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:45,339
services that are local that are either

678
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,799
on our home network local network are

679
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:50,229
things that we know are locally

680
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,059
provisioned and we can have proof that

681
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:55,629
these are things that the local network

682
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:57,719
is truly authoritative for we also want

683
00:32:55,629 --> 00:33:01,678
to then kind of use these provable

684
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:05,739
designations for other public services

685
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,319
we have a way to do for like a privacy

686
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:11,049
mode we're also proposing an oblivious

687
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,668
doe mechanism for cases which we don't

688
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:14,168
trust the network and then kind of like

689
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:17,829
the last case is using the direct

690
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:19,059
scenario so overall the picture can get

691
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,009
pretty complicated a lot of different

692
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:25,779
things going all over the place this is

693
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:27,369
you know one way the world can work one

694
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:30,029
question that can come up on all of this

695
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:33,039
is how do we bootstrap this world if we

696
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:36,219
you know so there are different ways of

697
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,539
setting up these designations if we do

698
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:39,819
trust the local network and we aren't

699
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:42,609
too worried about things then you know I

700
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:44,469
connect to Google I do a resolution for

701
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:47,049
Google the first time I say Oh Google

702
00:33:44,469 --> 00:33:49,299
has a public doser that I can use I

703
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,819
bootstrap off of that if I don't trust

704
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:54,519
the local network that's what we have

705
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:56,049
this scenario for oblivious Doe going on

706
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:59,169
and you can find out more about that at

707
00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:02,168
deprive anyway so that's it we do have

708
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:04,689
some drafts they are in deprive you can

709
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:07,689
file issues read about them make full

710
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:09,940
requests at the github and we also have

711
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:13,460
some sample code that's available all

712
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:16,879
right Tommy so on

713
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:20,929
one thing that I've been trying to sort

714
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,839
out is um well so as you know we have

715
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:25,190
this problem with yes and I we are we're

716
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,409
what single domain is serving multiple

717
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:32,000
CD ends so I think you see we're about

718
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:35,089
to go with this um so what happens if um

719
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,940
say I have a domain which is served by

720
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:41,899
um you know to CDN store call a and B um

721
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:43,399
and on and a decide and so when I

722
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:45,230
content and a decides to publish a

723
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:47,540
record saying that it should be the

724
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:51,349
designated server for a badge domain

725
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:53,179
um what is the impact of that on doesn't

726
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:57,980
that effectively pin me to a more or

727
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:59,270
less indefinitely right so this this is

728
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,800
one of the kind of issues and so if

729
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,839
we're looking at just as a quick answer

730
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,390
I think there's two general approaches

731
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:06,828
we can take what we're using to

732
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,000
communicate this designation is actually

733
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:10,460
the same record that we're going to be

734
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,079
using for yes and I and so you could

735
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,300
have just two designations and

736
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,859
presumably if I'm doing more resolutions

737
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,450
through A's Doh server it should also

738
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:19,819
not hide the fact that there is a

739
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,290
destination for B as well and there's

740
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:23,960
another solution that you could imagine

741
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,250
is that the owner of the domain that's

742
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,920
doing the load balancing between the

743
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,530
CDNs does have essentially either one of

744
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,790
them or some third entity as the one

745
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:34,730
designated thing that's doing the load

746
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:36,770
balancing sure my concern is the each of

747
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,170
them decides to do anything so it's

748
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,490
designated and then not tell you about

749
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,190
the other not tell you the other one and

750
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:44,808
then and then effectively you get you

751
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,700
effect that what this does that the

752
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,500
status quo gets pinned at one particular

753
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,480
load balancing such a set and then it

754
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,339
never can be changed because um you know

755
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,750
right so I think that's a almost

756
00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:56,328
considered rel so that I we didn't

757
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:59,599
offline but there's definitely something

758
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:01,849
good to explore it work komari Google

759
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,619
can you go back to 14 it's possible I'm

760
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:04,730
asking the same question as acre but I'm

761
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,339
not sure yes

762
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:09,920
so for the designated doe server mmm can

763
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:12,410
I also say that the google.com servers

764
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,700
should be able to resolve YouTube yes

765
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,899
can I also say that they should be able

766
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,460
to resolve Apple right this is where you

767
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,730
know the notion of okay we're to get the

768
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,860
authority from

769
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,780
so what we are saying this document is

770
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,670
these records that give these

771
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,930
designations should be DNS X science so

772
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,210
that we have proof that the person who

773
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,490
does have authority over that name is

774
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,980
truly indicating this relationship not

775
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:37,140
everyone loves DNS SEC but I think it

776
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:41,130
points to that you need some way to

777
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:43,049
prove this relationship that you can't

778
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,650
just claim authority over something else

779
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:49,920
right that's general for any solution I

780
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,870
think yeah so first I want to thank you

781
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,580
I think this is very interesting and I

782
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,410
put this will be very very useful one of

783
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:58,860
my concerns at least with some of the

784
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:00,529
deployment models has been that you end

785
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,050
up with two months centralization and

786
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:05,760
you're able to provide you know multiple

787
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,640
parties that provide different types of

788
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,860
services so so that that's a big

789
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,859
improvement so so that's good I did have

790
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:16,710
one more technical question about do you

791
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,090
support the case where or what are you

792
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,850
doing in a situation where multiple

793
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,250
parties might be sort of like you would

794
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,170
end up with multiple entities that can

795
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,510
resolve a particular name or do you have

796
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,730
that case to begin with well this is

797
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,730
kind of similar to a curse point I made

798
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:35,220
against the fact that a doe server could

799
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:36,840
resolve multiple many things like a lot

800
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,149
of these could be and if I talk to cloud

801
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,560
fire for something or quad 8 it can

802
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,540
resolve the whole internet the question

803
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:44,360
is when should I do it and it gets into

804
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,590
the notion of do I have a strong

805
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,200
designation an indication from the zone

806
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,610
owner some signed record that says yes

807
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,370
this is the thing you should be used for

808
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,810
this period of time so I think it's gets

809
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,890
into the same conversation so I think we

810
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,090
should kind of nip that all together

811
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:02,009
yeah all right thanks thank you

812
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,660
I'll come on I loved in a sec so that's

813
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:07,230
the part of the draft I certainly

814
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,850
approve of and I mean there's a more I

815
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,730
think probably technical discussion on

816
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:14,370
on on Friday yes so the one thing that

817
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:17,010
concerns me a bit I mean it is a fairly

818
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,720
complex picture um how are you going to

819
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,480
back this or how can we make sure that

820
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,500
it's kind of bulletproof so that my ISP

821
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:29,400
doesn't get a call for me because

822
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:31,050
doesn't work right right so I think we

823
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,300
can dig into this more there's you know

824
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,340
different scenarios like let's say that

825
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,140
I am in a case

826
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,320
I am trusting my peace is P for the

827
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,480
bootstrapping at that point it would

828
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:43,100
know the first time I talk into a given

829
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,930
zone right like the first time I talk

830
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,270
resolve Google and then at that point

831
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:49,850
Google becomes encrypted over dough so

832
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:52,490
you know hopefully it would be able to

833
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:54,589
debug kind of like those initial things

834
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,660
and then essentially any name that I see

835
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,550
off of Google after that point it's kind

836
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:02,870
of the Google servers fault if there's a

837
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:04,850
problem there so and potentially because

838
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,440
we will have official records within the

839
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,480
DNS our DNS exile records that are

840
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,950
public about which domains are going to

841
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,640
which places we'll be able to have trace

842
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:15,770
down where the errors may be occurring

843
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,370
and know who's the authority to but you

844
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:21,860
want to then expose that to the user and

845
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,240
so things to be clear we're a little

846
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,670
behind on the agenda so the lines

847
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,990
definitely close after Brian and I think

848
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,760
this is an excellent example though of

849
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:30,859
why bringing in this work to the IETF

850
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,170
can ferret out all the corner cases and

851
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:36,980
the interesting things well when I've

852
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:41,300
nailed down rebellious IC I can you go

853
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:42,740
back 114 it's on one yeah so there's at

854
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,070
least one box missing on that one which

855
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:48,109
is names that are not DNS names for

856
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:50,360
example you saw from NS switch Kampf so

857
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:52,490
yet C localhost

858
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,440
other naming systems that are not DNS

859
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,299
yep stuff that the operating system will

860
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,280
do for free if you're using gaturro

861
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:02,240
phone anymore similar yes it's a great

862
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:06,050
white finally an issue Brian Dixon Go

863
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,910
Daddy go forward a slide or two yeah so

864
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,310
what I'm wondering about is from a

865
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:13,250
scalability and caching perspective

866
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,140
whether having the client flipped from

867
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,930
one to another to another resolver

868
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:21,170
whether it might be worth considering

869
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:24,020
having the fourth the first one be a

870
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,230
forwarder and can take the advantage of

871
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,520
the scalability of client queries

872
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:31,520
anybody who's connected to the closest

873
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,170
cache to them forwarding is going to

874
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,120
benefit if other people are making the

875
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:38,710
same kind of queries plus it's gonna

876
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,870
have more local benefit yeah that's fair

877
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:43,160
you know there is definitely the privacy

878
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,980
aspect in which we don't necessarily

879
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,420
want to put all of our names through

880
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,270
something that can see things that we

881
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,700
don't trust

882
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,550
also one of the benefits of going to

883
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,270
things that are not necessarily

884
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,950
authorities but something that are

885
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,750
designated is that they should have

886
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:59,640
really high hit rates right like so if I

887
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:01,050
go to you know the Google Doh server and

888
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,759
everyone else is going to that

889
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,430
particular server for those names or at

890
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,720
least their local top of it you should

891
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,669
have a pretty high hit rate and they'll

892
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,350
be actually able to really well optimize

893
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,120
their content that's the goal from this

894
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:14,970
it should provide a lot of opportunities

895
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,500
to different content providers anyway

896
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:31,529
thank you for the time to want to views

897
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:34,470
anymore of it so we're now entering the

898
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:37,140
the chartering discussion phase of the

899
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:40,439
meeting and just to kick that off I

900
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:44,279
wanted to show a few slides to remind

901
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,950
people what we're talking about there

902
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,770
was an original I'll take one

903
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,029
interruption here just to kind of for

904
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,570
those of you not familiar with the

905
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,710
process of a working group forming ball

906
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,630
what we're looking here is trying to

907
00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:01,860
identify whether there are concrete work

908
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:03,300
items that we could adopt in it that

909
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,950
makes sense to have their own working

910
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:09,210
group for us to focus on being able to

911
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:11,910
work toward actual deliverables and of

912
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,950
note a couple of things is the final

913
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,290
decision of course is not really up to

914
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:18,330
this room it is ultimately up to the isg

915
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,810
but whatever discussion while we are

916
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:24,600
presenting a draft possibility for the

917
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:26,730
Charter we are able we are discussing

918
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,200
that here and able to modify it as seems

919
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,790
appropriate we will be trying to drill

920
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,149
down on some of these stickier questions

921
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:37,710
there and also of note so that the final

922
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,500
determination of you know like what we

923
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,030
would like to advance to the isg to make

924
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,250
a final decision about chartering a

925
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,620
working group will of course take as

926
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:50,070
part of normal idea processes will take

927
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,990
place online and also important to note

928
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,880
although Ben and I were co-chairs of DOE

929
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:56,220
and in our co-chairs of this both we are

930
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,870
not necessarily the co-chairs of your

931
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,149
new working group that is a separate

932
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:01,618
matter to be determined so if that kind

933
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,059
of influences your decision about

934
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,549
which way you think things should go

935
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:11,539
that's a separate issue to the

936
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:16,259
chartering discussion thanks David

937
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:17,640
so there was a when this when this

938
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:20,759
working group forming Boff was announced

939
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,950
it was announced with a draft charter in

940
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:24,960
order to solicit feedback that feedback

941
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,490
largely came on the a DD mailing list

942
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,190
there was quite a bit of discussion of

943
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:32,609
that draft of the Charter based on that

944
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:34,980
feedback we attempted to produce an

945
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:37,019
updated Charter proposal that reflected

946
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:40,019
as much as that feedback as as we could

947
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:42,089
manage and I wanted to highlight some of

948
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:44,578
the differences from that original

949
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:47,119
Charter proposal there's also since been

950
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,950
extensive discussion on the list of this

951
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,450
latest draft of the Charter proposal and

952
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:55,019
we'll have some more discussion of that

953
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:59,098
today so the the first set of notable

954
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:01,109
changes are in what the original draft

955
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:04,619
called initial areas of focus we've

956
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:08,359
clearly expanded the the detailing of

957
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:11,970
what these areas are to to try to

958
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:13,910
clarify precisely what it is that might

959
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:18,269
be of interest to this working group and

960
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:21,839
these are intended to be essentially

961
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:25,700
technical and less controversial working

962
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:29,400
group items that more or less reflect

963
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:33,450
the kinds of interests that we saw in

964
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,279
this year's technical drafts that I on

965
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:40,379
client behavior that I mentioned in an

966
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:42,989
earlier slide and the second set of

967
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:46,200
changes are related to what the original

968
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:51,720
draft described as best current

969
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:54,299
practices so the latest draft again

970
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,569
changes the phrasing and expands and

971
00:44:54,299 --> 00:45:00,538
details some of these potential best

972
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:05,640
practice areas and also in particular

973
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:08,069
adds a a condition for discussion of

974
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:11,460
these working group items that because

975
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:15,029
they are highly controversial that we

976
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:17,310
are going to that this Charter would

977
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,770
would restrict the working groups

978
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:22,020
consideration of these topics to avoid

979
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,840
them essentially overwhelming the less

980
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:27,300
controversial topics essentially saying

981
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:31,710
that they can be discussed but they

982
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:33,150
can't be argued so if you basically if

983
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,140
there's substantial disagreement within

984
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,940
the working group those disagreements

985
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:37,589
have to be resolved outside the working

986
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,790
group not during working group time in

987
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,290
order to allow the working group to

988
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,410
continue to make progress on less

989
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:45,210
controversial topics so that is the

990
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:49,259
current proposed charter text I'm also

991
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:55,380
going to pull up here the full the full

992
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:57,360
current draft charter and the the rest

993
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,310
of this time is open discussion but as

994
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:02,430
the the first topic I would encourage

995
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,930
you to consider especially the question

996
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,169
of these controversial topics which has

997
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:09,750
been much debated on the mailing list it

998
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:13,710
seems to me that there are essentially

999
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:16,170
three major major considerations here

1000
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:18,450
whether we should essentially keep the

1001
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:22,110
text more or less as it is whether we

1002
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:23,939
should render these topics as included

1003
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:26,370
in the working group scope without any

1004
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:31,380
special conditions or whether we should

1005
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:32,609
exclude them entirely and one last thing

1006
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,260
that I'd like to request as you're

1007
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,150
making your microphone comments please

1008
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,250
also offer just a general statement

1009
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:41,310
about whether you support the formation

1010
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:43,590
of a working group at all and then on

1011
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:46,430
that point that been brought up what

1012
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:48,960
your particular feeling is as far as

1013
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:54,240
resolving or dealing with these

1014
00:46:48,960 --> 00:47:00,780
controversial areas okay Aaron Faulk

1015
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:04,649
Akamai I was confused by the term full

1016
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:06,240
consensus in that slide and I was

1017
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:10,440
wondering are you trying to set a

1018
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,359
different standard for how to admit

1019
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:15,300
these topics or were you just trying to

1020
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:19,140
be clear or because you weren't that

1021
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,330
wasn't clear to me so anyways sure so I

1022
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,569
think I may be to blame for the full

1023
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:25,120
consensus line

1024
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:28,310
[Music]

1025
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:29,990
my my interpretation of that line is to

1026
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,279
say that essentially in the course of

1027
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:36,290
the working group if somebody comes up

1028
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,850
to the microphone and says no we're not

1029
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:42,080
gonna do like I don't want to do it this

1030
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:43,759
way then then the the further argument

1031
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,160
between proponents and opponents on

1032
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,150
those topics has to happen outside the

1033
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:52,490
working group and the working group can

1034
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:54,710
move on to other topics I think that's a

1035
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:57,919
really interesting idea that's not what

1036
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:00,230
I thought full consensus that's not what

1037
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,820
I understood the phrase to mean so you

1038
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:07,160
might want to clarify that gentleman

1039
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,350
kava random network copywriter I'm

1040
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:11,990
excited to see the opinion because I'm a

1041
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,549
bit scared about potential implications

1042
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,770
for networks I'm Iranian

1043
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:18,860
so it might sounds like a neat picking

1044
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:21,259
but I would love to see dns64 being

1045
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:23,450
explicitly mentioned as a sync we need

1046
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:26,140
to think about because I suspect some of

1047
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:28,939
that behavior might have unexpected

1048
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,390
implications for v6 only networks is

1049
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,390
dns64

1050
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:41,299
David Skinner's a DNS enthusiast could

1051
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,710
you go back to the slide I think it was

1052
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:47,000
changes between the Charter but the

1053
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:51,760
first one yes this one those items on

1054
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:57,230
the right well first off that's a lot

1055
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,970
secondly I so I wouldn't try to say

1056
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:01,810
exactly which ones but a lot of these

1057
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:04,700
are already in the Charter of DNS up and

1058
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:06,259
that sounds strange to me that this

1059
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,410
Charter is conflicting with an existing

1060
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,120
working group and so yes I definitely

1061
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:15,649
like to address that particular point in

1062
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:18,470
that so in particular as you may recall

1063
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:22,040
ABCD is application behavior considering

1064
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:24,049
DNS and so the the audience is actually

1065
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:27,560
much broader than the typical audience

1066
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:29,540
for DNS up and DNS off itself is now

1067
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,049
three working group chairs and very

1068
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:35,120
frequently two sessions every IETF

1069
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:36,770
there's a lot going on in DNS up that

1070
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,080
and a lot of people that are interested

1071
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:40,030
in these other areas

1072
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,850
are not interested in participating in

1073
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:46,060
the full breadth of DNS up and so the

1074
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:48,100
you will also have noticed in the draft

1075
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,230
charter that there's a paragraph at the

1076
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,000
end that says you know we will closely

1077
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,460
be working this working group would be

1078
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,480
closely working with both deprive and

1079
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,220
dns off in doing its business and I

1080
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,380
personally speaking without a hat but

1081
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,060
just my own personal expectation would

1082
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,350
be that the chairs of each of the

1083
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,299
working groups would be working closely

1084
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:09,549
to identify which particular working

1085
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,260
group would be most suited to the type

1086
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:13,480
of work that's being done some of these

1087
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,930
things I agree I think are more

1088
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,270
specifically DNS up but quite a few of

1089
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:21,279
them it's I think the questions are a

1090
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:23,080
little bit greater where they would find

1091
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,820
their best home and so the idea for

1092
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:27,670
forming the separate working group

1093
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,530
though is to increase participation from

1094
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:32,170
the community that would not normally

1095
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:37,840
otherwise participate in the full volume

1096
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:43,150
of the NS a-- so thank you does clarify

1097
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:44,620
things but i'm not true so maybe someone

1098
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,750
can tell me if there's president here

1099
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:49,720
but saying that another working group is

1100
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:52,900
Genda is too full doesn't sound like a

1101
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,069
good reason to form something else and

1102
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,810
i'm not saying we shouldn't form this

1103
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:59,200
like i'm just saying a lot of these

1104
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:01,090
items like dns should be debuggable like

1105
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,609
that's an operational issue of the dns

1106
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:08,190
and we have a working group for that so

1107
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:08,190
i think this needs to be narrowed a lot

1108
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,530
yarc so i think this a lot of

1109
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,840
interesting work that could be done

1110
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:20,260
everything that we see is so seen today

1111
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:23,230
I do agree that this list while I like

1112
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:25,630
this this list it's it's also indeed a

1113
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,640
little bit long I think these kinds of

1114
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:30,310
both meetings go best if you don't focus

1115
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:32,080
too much on where the work actually ends

1116
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,279
up whether it's in this working group or

1117
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,810
some other working group that's a

1118
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,920
management issue that you guys in the

1119
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:41,290
IES table handle somehow but we should

1120
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,140
focus on which things actually we we

1121
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:45,640
believe are needed and useful and and

1122
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,020
should be done it now or not yet done

1123
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,970
obviously if there already are being

1124
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,160
addressed somewhere else then that we

1125
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,029
shouldn't list it here so that's one

1126
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,069
comment

1127
00:51:52,030 --> 00:52:00,690
the other comment is is on your other

1128
00:51:54,070 --> 00:52:03,490
list and while I you know basically

1129
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:05,800
agree with you know much of what is said

1130
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:08,529
here I do take exception with one of

1131
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:13,150
these items and that is the privacy and

1132
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:15,940
pervasive surveillance item and I think

1133
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:18,370
it's our job to worry about things such

1134
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,980
as the end user privacy and pervasive

1135
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:23,020
surveillance and when we are working on

1136
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,570
these topics like we're some of the

1137
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:27,160
proposed work items include like these

1138
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:29,050
architectures that would do you know

1139
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,750
some kind of distribution and to not be

1140
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:33,790
able to analyze what the impacts of

1141
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:36,040
those architectures or you know if you

1142
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:38,110
don't do those architecture it is that

1143
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:41,290
seems like a major Mis and also I

1144
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:44,050
believe it's so according to our PCPs

1145
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:46,480
that we have to address some of these

1146
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:50,800
issues if we work on particular pieces

1147
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,090
of technology thank you so on that topic

1148
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,860
I would just note that this is not a

1149
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,570
list of items that are out of scope for

1150
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,760
the working group this is a list of

1151
00:52:55,570 --> 00:53:03,790
items where the working group should not

1152
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:06,850
engage in in argument if I can pull up

1153
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:09,640
follow up briefly so so that I mean III

1154
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:13,299
get that but it doesn't doesn't seem

1155
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:14,980
very realistic to be honest and there

1156
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,240
are some topics they're hard but you

1157
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:21,010
know these are hard things that we

1158
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:22,839
actually need to address them our

1159
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:27,820
note-taker is helpfully noted that this

1160
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:32,170
is a danger danger danger list right on

1161
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:33,510
this particular like the ITF as I've

1162
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:37,120
mentioned in the past one of the

1163
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:39,400
challenges is that we very frequently

1164
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,900
like to say that we don't do policy but

1165
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,540
it's also very clear that a lot of

1166
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,510
technology we develop greece's policies

1167
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:48,820
kids one direction or the other and in

1168
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:51,010
this particular area at least the ITF

1169
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:54,190
came out with a very clear statement on

1170
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:56,980
how it perceives pervasive monitoring

1171
00:53:54,190 --> 00:54:01,450
and and therefore the design of

1172
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:04,330
protocols are enhancing our our defenses

1173
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:08,290
against pervasive surveillance also

1174
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:12,370
have this additional problem of blocking

1175
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:13,960
benign surveillance and Danger Danger

1176
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,910
Danger just even using those terms

1177
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,370
together I realize is a giant minefield

1178
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:21,399
but I that the intent of this bullet

1179
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:25,180
point was to say that arguing that point

1180
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,690
back and forth is not going to be a

1181
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,259
productive discussion in the working

1182
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:30,670
Patrick McManus

1183
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,270
I'm just for clarity our our chairs

1184
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:35,830
acting as proponents of this buff our

1185
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:39,340
the chairs acting as proponents of

1186
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:41,110
forming this working group I personally

1187
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:47,170
am a proponent of the existence of the

1188
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:48,730
working group yes so yeah I guess for

1189
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:51,400
myself and by the way we would encourage

1190
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:54,940
people in the in the line to to tell us

1191
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:58,150
what you think on the topic I don't mean

1192
00:54:54,940 --> 00:55:01,300
to to be purporting or opposing

1193
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:03,220
formation of the working group I I did

1194
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,080
put some work in we want to make sure

1195
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:06,399
that people understand the text we seem

1196
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,230
to be I mean dialogue where people make

1197
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,270
comments and then you respond as if you

1198
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:13,600
are proponents for the responses and

1199
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:14,890
that's an unusual model and the most

1200
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,900
important question in front of us is

1201
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:18,400
whether this buff has a charter in front

1202
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,020
of us and that should be used is the

1203
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,570
basis for a new working group I don't

1204
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,100
believe is so for a bunch of reasons

1205
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:27,340
it's one the Charter lacks specificity

1206
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:29,290
in fact it actually has almost it has no

1207
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:32,830
deliverables in the Charter at all but

1208
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:34,450
almost everything is in scope we need

1209
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,220
consensus that any deliverables have a

1210
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:37,480
high chance of success but there's no

1211
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:40,240
clarity and what those deliver both

1212
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,650
might be the Charter relies on a number

1213
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,439
of new concepts that are not really

1214
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:46,390
normal IETF consensus processes the

1215
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,100
notion of full consensus and the more

1216
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,600
novel topic that some things are

1217
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,150
relevant but the group shall not try and

1218
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,890
resolve their disagreement on them this

1219
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,620
has a low probability I would suggest if

1220
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,970
working at all and you know mostly most

1221
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,589
importantly this is not a matter of just

1222
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:01,600
refining the Charter I really think this

1223
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,760
is inherent in the nature of what we're

1224
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:06,150
discussing here this is politics that is

1225
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,700
not well suited to our consensus process

1226
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:11,350
so RFC 54:34 has some considerations for

1227
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,450
a successful Baath we might look at

1228
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:15,190
those I miss the scope for the problem

1229
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:16,419
well understood and that is people

1230
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:17,770
generally understand what the working

1231
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,420
group will work on

1232
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:21,190
I suggest you know there are no

1233
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,680
deliverables so that's not really very

1234
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,240
clear there's an agreement that the

1235
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,160
specific set of deliverables are the

1236
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,839
right set perhaps the null set is the

1237
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,460
right set of model I'll go that far

1238
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:31,630
I'm is it believed that the working

1239
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,490
group has a reasonable probability of

1240
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:35,109
having success ie in completing the

1241
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,970
deliverables in the Charter in a timely

1242
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:38,170
fashion well there are no deliverables

1243
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,410
so I guess we kind of got that one in

1244
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,410
the bag

1245
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:46,240
you know and 54-34 also asks for

1246
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,828
specificity from the both proponents in

1247
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,598
what questions will be asked because

1248
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:53,980
that is the question in front of us I'm

1249
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:59,230
still not sure exactly so I think this

1250
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:59,589
isn't ready for a working group Erica

1251
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:03,490
squirrel

1252
00:56:59,589 --> 00:57:06,220
longtime listener first-time caller yeah

1253
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:11,020
I mean Patrick that was uh you made me

1254
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:12,098
almost irrelevant almost so let's take a

1255
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,780
step back remember what happened the

1256
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,800
history of what's happened here which is

1257
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,900
the ITF published specification

1258
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,280
published oh there was consent

1259
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,940
specification mission accomplished

1260
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:24,160
um and then um there was discussion of

1261
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,240
deployment of the specification vendors

1262
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,770
made a bunch of choice decisions about

1263
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,180
different vendors made different

1264
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,559
decisions and their announcements a

1265
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,419
bunch of people were sad about those

1266
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:33,970
decisions and we've now spent a

1267
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:35,140
basically the past year um going back

1268
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,189
and forth between the people with other

1269
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:40,029
decisions were good the people for the

1270
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:41,829
decisions were bad and um now that's a

1271
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:43,930
perfectly healthy kind of debate I think

1272
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:46,750
we have not advanced like one nanometer

1273
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,759
in uh in actually getting consensus from

1274
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,309
like the positions we started run um so

1275
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:55,089
that's not been super helpful um and so

1276
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:57,369
the question now is what as honnest

1277
00:57:55,089 --> 00:57:59,170
Ruffini pointed out in montreal we

1278
00:57:57,369 --> 00:58:01,240
publish technical specifications that's

1279
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:03,880
the purpose of this enterprise we're all

1280
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,379
collectively in and so we had asked what

1281
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,549
technical specifications can we publish

1282
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:11,920
that are the output of this work and so

1283
00:58:08,549 --> 00:58:14,530
the some of the things on your like

1284
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,450
group one list you know of things we

1285
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:17,950
might work on um seemed like interesting

1286
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:20,470
ideas i'm on particular interested in

1287
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,359
number two um there's way too many there

1288
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:25,419
we ought to start small and make some

1289
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:26,740
progress on one of them um the second

1290
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:28,180
things all the things you do about like

1291
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:31,040
at oxford debating society which we are

1292
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,779
not so i like

1293
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,890
it is not a good use of our time to

1294
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,090
attempt to reach resolution on things

1295
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:36,589
which you already know we have violent

1296
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,890
disagreement upon and we do have common

1297
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:41,410
ground so I think that while I

1298
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:43,460
appreciate your full consensus

1299
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:45,350
suggestion I think striking those

1300
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,660
entirely give you much better and if

1301
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:48,830
people wish to discuss those in some

1302
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:55,700
other forum perhaps you could find out

1303
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:57,200
what that way to do that well I'm not

1304
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:00,950
sure if I should maybe let somebody else

1305
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:07,460
speak after just so I can compose myself

1306
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:09,589
I will let a couple people go ahead mark

1307
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,960
nottingham i do not think we should

1308
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:16,430
contemplate a charter in this form or

1309
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:19,100
similar forms for a working group in in

1310
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:21,368
my experience working groups set up in

1311
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,420
this fashion are are very likely to fail

1312
00:59:21,369 --> 00:59:25,010
you're building conflict into the

1313
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,900
charter it's much better to have

1314
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:28,460
something small and distinct that you

1315
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,320
know you can get agreement on that we

1316
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,600
want to do this and move that forward

1317
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,430
and and that in my experience is a much

1318
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,109
more successful model for a charter I

1319
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,490
acknowledge we need to continue

1320
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:39,319
discussing this we need a forum for that

1321
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,209
discussion that doesn't have to be a

1322
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,410
working group though and what I'm

1323
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,700
concerned about is is that there are

1324
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,009
some interesting and I think useful

1325
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:48,470
things in this space I especially like

1326
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:50,330
Tommy's proposal that if they were

1327
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,980
adopted by working group like this they

1328
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:54,770
would be put at risk by the circus that

1329
00:59:51,980 --> 01:00:01,220
would surround it so I strongly against

1330
00:59:54,770 --> 01:00:05,030
this charter or anything like it hi

1331
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:07,129
Brian Trammell I actually kind of like

1332
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:10,369
the Charter on the left more than the

1333
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:13,130
Charter on the right like this this this

1334
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:14,690
looks like I mean people often say the

1335
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:17,210
IETF process is terrible because it

1336
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:19,190
leads to protocols designed by committee

1337
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:21,109
this reads like a charter designed by

1338
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:24,200
committee because it actually was um I

1339
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:26,600
think that is a it's it's useful to

1340
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,980
basically have had the discussion to say

1341
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,500
let's expand the list of things that

1342
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,670
were willing to consider because I think

1343
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,500
there's a lot of work that needs to be

1344
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,270
done in this space I'll say when I was

1345
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,619
looking at the the two sort of

1346
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:38,540
introductory presentations here I was

1347
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:40,010
like oh that that all looks like that

1348
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,660
those look like interesting small well

1349
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,070
scope questions that would work

1350
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:44,180
perfectly in a working group and I can

1351
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,740
see the deliverable and this sounds

1352
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:48,940
great

1353
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:50,290
um and maybe saying like going over and

1354
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,910
saying so both of them had to do with

1355
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:54,700
the resolver discovery and sort of the

1356
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:56,558
generalized how do I figure out what my

1357
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:58,210
environment looks like for resolution

1358
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,849
which is what's kind of missing from

1359
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:02,920
from doe right like so that's that's

1360
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:06,640
where the technical friction is here and

1361
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,319
I would say going back looking at all of

1362
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,328
the of the input we've gotten from the

1363
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:13,660
community on sort of the what needs to

1364
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:16,270
be in the latest draft and saying let's

1365
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,890
pick one pick one and then and then

1366
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:21,250
explicitly in the Charter say closer

1367
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:24,879
recharter right it's like doing these in

1368
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:26,260
a more serial way will be much more

1369
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,910
productive you can actually write down

1370
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:30,579
deliverables which makes it easy to

1371
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:33,430
determine whether write deliverables and

1372
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:34,990
it fixes the problem that people came in

1373
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:36,009
the door with the beginning Great Lakes

1374
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,930
so there was all the discovery thing

1375
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:39,760
does actually seem like it needs work

1376
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:41,799
and it eats work quicker then we're

1377
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,349
gonna get to if we argue over the exact

1378
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:47,770
scope of the thing on the right um

1379
01:01:44,349 --> 01:01:49,150
I have opinions about the next slide but

1380
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,589
I don't want you to put the next slide

1381
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:52,599
up in order to talk about them because

1382
01:01:50,589 --> 01:01:58,930
it's kind of like red meat and red flags

1383
01:01:52,599 --> 01:02:02,130
and so I would say entering a working

1384
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:05,589
group based on a much on a cut-down

1385
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:08,920
version of this Charter that looks more

1386
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:12,190
like the one before the discussion makes

1387
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,349
sense and you really need to we need to

1388
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:15,790
have like it's gonna require discipline

1389
01:02:14,349 --> 01:02:16,960
chairs right like it's not gonna be a

1390
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,460
thing it's like hey we're gonna talk

1391
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,230
about these things but only like in full

1392
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:21,849
consensus is actually gonna be your a

1393
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:24,760
list of things we're not gonna or talk

1394
01:02:21,849 --> 01:02:26,020
talk about outside of the scope of the

1395
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:30,130
very specific technical decisions that

1396
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:31,809
we're making on deliverables so with

1397
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:33,339
that caveat I think that that this

1398
01:02:31,809 --> 01:02:37,809
working group really needs to exist not

1399
01:02:33,339 --> 01:02:39,759
with this charter but I would hope that

1400
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:42,359
we could iterate on this on the list and

1401
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:47,890
do like spend something up before

1402
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:49,420
Vancouver thank you Jim reads I'm

1403
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:51,578
supportive of creating about group

1404
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:53,770
something supposed to the slides and I'm

1405
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:56,049
totally happy with the chapter that's

1406
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:58,890
before the draft updated chatter this

1407
01:02:56,049 --> 01:03:00,570
been in place the moment

1408
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:02,250
I think the choice of these mods for

1409
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:03,480
consensus is perhaps me what button

1410
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,150
forts it because that's creatively

1411
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,380
stifling fusion misunderstandings and

1412
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:10,109
that's maybe something needs to be

1413
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:11,820
tweaked yes some of the deliverables or

1414
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:13,200
maybe could be fleshed out a little bit

1415
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,579
more but I have to disagree with from

1416
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,859
the points that mark was meeting or

1417
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:19,170
about the potential for this thing to go

1418
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:21,270
on go go for add fairly very quickly

1419
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:24,150
when we discuss on the topics that we

1420
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:26,400
discussed before I think most probes yes

1421
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,280
there are theoretical possibility and

1422
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,200
provided the work unit behaves itself

1423
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,849
again that's maybe a bit of an unknown

1424
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,500
if they wanna get behaved itself

1425
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:36,450
there shouldn't be a crime a problem and

1426
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:41,130
if we get into territory which is likely

1427
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:43,379
to cross lack of consensus or people

1428
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:45,750
start to misbehave that's really be down

1429
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:48,720
to the working group cheers to intervene

1430
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:51,900
and to get people to either see sense or

1431
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,000
shut up or behave themselves and if

1432
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:56,490
you've got a strong working group Cheers

1433
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,800
a strong ad to meet those kind of

1434
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:00,450
interventions in a timely manner before

1435
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:02,339
things go off at tangent so we end up

1436
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:04,470
having a slimy match then things should

1437
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,819
keep themselves pretty much in line yes

1438
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:07,439
as a theater grist that things could

1439
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:09,180
maybe go wrong but before you've got the

1440
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,700
right leadership and I have to give

1441
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,259
common sense this shouldn't happen maybe

1442
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,910
I'm just being too optimistic about that

1443
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:16,740
but I think we can solve these problems

1444
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,660
if they too much difficulty and get down

1445
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,189
to the job of solving the real issues

1446
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,899
such as the ones that we've been talked

1447
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,790
about before do the two presentations

1448
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,480
before going to the Charter discussion

1449
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:26,480
thank you

1450
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,230
Brian Dixon GoDaddy

1451
01:04:29,310 --> 01:04:34,730
there's one thing on I think the next

1452
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:37,349
slide op that forward just for a second

1453
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:41,609
from the right hand side the first

1454
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:45,300
bullet I think that bullet point might

1455
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:48,390
better be handled through making that a

1456
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:51,960
required element of any working group

1457
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:53,279
draft as a section the same as currently

1458
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,250
there's a security requirements

1459
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:58,740
requirements for a security section

1460
01:04:55,250 --> 01:05:01,020
given the nature and scope of the the

1461
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,430
working group if it forms I think that

1462
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,380
would be sufficient for addressing that

1463
01:05:02,430 --> 01:05:09,930
and please get rid of that slide go back

1464
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:11,340
one sorry on the issue of some of the

1465
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:14,680
the

1466
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:17,320
consensus specifically the single person

1467
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:21,430
saying no that's a huge red flag for me

1468
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:24,520
from a process this this flies back to

1469
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:28,029
my experience over the last twenty years

1470
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:31,570
in the ITF where there's been a lot of

1471
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:33,820
bad behavior that is under the covers or

1472
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:35,800
behind the scenes that has been alluded

1473
01:05:33,820 --> 01:05:37,300
to by various different people and it's

1474
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,550
left a lot of bad tastes and a lot of

1475
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,800
people's mouths this is exactly the

1476
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:43,990
wrong approach to take in my opinion I

1477
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:47,530
would prefer to see something a little

1478
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:49,779
more neutral geared towards a strong

1479
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:52,540
working group chair and something that

1480
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:54,130
at least requires something like a

1481
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:59,050
Robert's Rules

1482
01:05:54,130 --> 01:06:01,810
you know nominate and second we really

1483
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:04,300
want to avoid blocking valid and

1484
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:08,140
valuable contributions and discussions

1485
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:10,000
even if they are contentious general

1486
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,980
rough consensus is not the same as

1487
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,750
unanimity and I think that it's

1488
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,820
extremely important in some of the

1489
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:18,370
issues and thirdly from a process

1490
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,440
perspective I think something having

1491
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:23,100
been previously established in some

1492
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:25,960
working groups somewhere should not

1493
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:28,270
preempt revisiting some of those

1494
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,190
discussions there's a specific to one

1495
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:32,680
particular area but I think as a process

1496
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:37,420
we should be opening open to discussing

1497
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:42,970
those without being you know obstinate

1498
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:44,860
or uncooperative and strong working

1499
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:49,120
group the chair is critical to the whole

1500
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:51,730
thing as a general comment I would say

1501
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,980
I'm in form of I'm in favor of forming

1502
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:56,650
the working group I believe for the

1503
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:59,350
working group content it would make more

1504
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:01,090
sense for maybe I'm more structured

1505
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:02,710
rather than a simple linear list

1506
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,780
- maybe group things together that

1507
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:07,810
belong together so they can be

1508
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:11,230
prioritized and linked together and then

1509
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:14,710
ask for volunteers to write the material

1510
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:17,950
and to review it following the precedent

1511
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:20,050
from DNS xed which predates dns off that

1512
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:23,009
process worked extremely well anyway

1513
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:23,010
those are my comments

1514
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,700
Suz if you could wait I think let's

1515
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:33,470
switch back my confront my keys

1516
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:35,750
alternating okay Nalini Elkins I would

1517
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:37,879
like to support very much that the

1518
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:40,460
support for debugging and analysis and

1519
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,820
also put in measurement there was just

1520
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:46,340
recently an IEP G presentation where it

1521
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:48,860
appears that multiple queries are sent

1522
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:51,080
where one who would have expected one

1523
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:53,330
query for reasons that are not well

1524
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,430
understood and these are exactly the

1525
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:57,950
kind of issues that we need to be able

1526
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:59,120
to understand on certainly the networks

1527
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:01,069
that I work on which are large

1528
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,230
enterprise networks we need to be able

1529
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:05,180
to manage these protocols understand

1530
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:07,700
what the traffic is so I and I would

1531
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:14,480
like to see that built in baked into the

1532
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:16,130
protocol Suzanne Wolfe first is jabber

1533
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:17,450
scribe and then I'm gonna plead for the

1534
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,630
chairs indulgence for a very brief

1535
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:22,580
comment as Deanna Saab co-chair first

1536
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:24,260
from the jabber room Chris lemons

1537
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:26,059
I'm significantly in favor of working

1538
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:27,470
group formation it's unclear to me how

1539
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,600
to put discussion in scope but not

1540
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,859
resolution of disagreement resolution of

1541
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,930
disagreement is a major part of what

1542
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:34,160
working groups do every working group

1543
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:36,200
has to narrow scope of discussion

1544
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:38,358
sometimes taking the discussion offline

1545
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,500
to breakouts when topics get hot in

1546
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:41,299
order to get things done

1547
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,649
I think monitoring that conversation is

1548
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:45,080
just part of the admittedly difficult

1549
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:46,460
work of the chairs I don't know how that

1550
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,049
Charter should put these topics out of

1551
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:50,120
scope particularly since we'd benefit

1552
01:08:48,049 --> 01:08:53,689
significantly if we came to consensus on

1553
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:55,700
some of those topics further responding

1554
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:57,639
the Patrick Chris lemons while it's true

1555
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:59,929
that the Charter could use improved

1556
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,220
specificity and deliverables it's

1557
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:02,720
inaccurate to say that there are no

1558
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,609
deliverables present there are several

1559
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,040
specific topics in the Charter like

1560
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:08,359
discovery of resolvers dns push and such

1561
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,160
that could certainly be turned into the

1562
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:14,930
basis for the specific working group

1563
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:19,000
items fairly directly also as dan Asaf

1564
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:21,319
co-chair the DNS op Charter and this one

1565
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,660
might in fact need some further

1566
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:24,950
discussion to refine what goes where but

1567
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,108
with that said the current day and I

1568
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:28,849
thought Charter was designed in part

1569
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:31,549
significantly so that we could in fact

1570
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:34,819
push off work to other working groups to

1571
01:09:31,549 --> 01:09:35,779
support having a narrower or more

1572
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:38,540
specific set of

1573
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:40,670
and constituents in a dedicated working

1574
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,470
group so for any of the encrypted DNS

1575
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:46,130
topics for the application specific

1576
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:48,200
aspects of these topics certainly I

1577
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:50,750
think that what what David said as chair

1578
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:52,700
of this session is true that the two

1579
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:55,550
working groups would collaborate closely

1580
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:59,630
at the idea and at the area and the

1581
01:09:55,550 --> 01:10:01,310
Cheras level but also you know and that

1582
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:03,410
the DNS table co-chairs would be happy

1583
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:07,100
to discuss which items belong where but

1584
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:09,470
there is nothing wrong in under terms of

1585
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,120
DNS aw history or charter with saying

1586
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:13,070
there's a specific set of work items

1587
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,570
here they're related to each other there

1588
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,710
requires specific expertise and

1589
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:17,870
interests that are not necessarily

1590
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:20,780
present in DNS op for all of the other

1591
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:22,490
things DNS op does and there's no reason

1592
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:29,750
not to do this if the work items can be

1593
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:34,400
grouped and managed properly you want to

1594
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:35,480
go to the back ok ELISA Cooper I just

1595
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,389
wanted to respond to a couple of things

1596
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:40,190
that have been said if my response to

1597
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:44,300
Brian actually both of these were

1598
01:10:40,190 --> 01:10:48,259
designed by committee so take that for

1599
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:50,360
what it's worth and just piling on to

1600
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,230
what sue said someone had asked like if

1601
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,480
there's a working group that's

1602
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:55,250
overloaded is is that reason enough to

1603
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,870
create another working group I think

1604
01:10:55,250 --> 01:11:00,620
there's there's a lot of precedent in

1605
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:02,809
the art area for splitting off related

1606
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,059
topics just so that you can have you

1607
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:07,430
know more chairs more meeting time a

1608
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:09,410
little bit more of a focused audience

1609
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:11,150
it's something that we've done with with

1610
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:12,950
several protocols in the art area so I

1611
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:17,360
think there is you know some precedent

1612
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:21,830
for for doing that I think given the

1613
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:27,530
nature of of this set of topics well I I

1614
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:29,150
respect the the impetus to attempt some

1615
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:33,440
process innovation is actually like the

1616
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:36,500
worst kind of of topic to try that we

1617
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:38,330
have a process it has you know it has

1618
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,160
its faults and strengths but we kind of

1619
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:43,190
know how it works and for something

1620
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,599
that's as messy as this people might

1621
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:46,309
want to think about maybe we should just

1622
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:48,320
use it the way that we know that it is

1623
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:49,789
as opposed to you know the full

1624
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,669
consensus thing and

1625
01:11:49,789 --> 01:11:55,579
you know trying to overly manage the the

1626
01:11:52,669 --> 01:11:56,689
contention and the last thing I will say

1627
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:59,090
is that one thing I've noticed about

1628
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:01,280
this discussion is that people are

1629
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:02,510
getting to the point ER maybe already at

1630
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,550
the point where there's they're so dug

1631
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:05,869
in that like the person comes to the mic

1632
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:07,760
you're reflexively know whether you're

1633
01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:09,709
gonna agree or disagree with them before

1634
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,800
they've even open their mouth and I

1635
01:12:09,709 --> 01:12:14,269
really think that finding a small set of

1636
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,579
focused work items that people could

1637
01:12:14,269 --> 01:12:18,559
collaborate on to actually feel like

1638
01:12:16,579 --> 01:12:21,829
they accomplished something together as

1639
01:12:18,559 --> 01:12:24,829
opposed to sitting in your own camp is

1640
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:31,639
probably the only way to make forward

1641
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:33,829
progress here oh yeah hadra gambling for

1642
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:37,399
one I'm consulting just building on that

1643
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:38,840
last set of comments I think it's

1644
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:41,149
self-evident there's a need for a

1645
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:43,419
working group there's stuff here that

1646
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:47,479
needs to be done that doesn't sit well

1647
01:12:43,419 --> 01:12:48,960
anywhere else the two slides there's far

1648
01:12:47,479 --> 01:12:50,209
too much for a working group

1649
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,010
[Music]

1650
01:12:50,209 --> 01:12:54,229
I think the second slide there's nothing

1651
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:56,989
there of merit that fits in a working

1652
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:59,030
group it nor looks like policy the first

1653
01:12:56,989 --> 01:13:01,398
slide if you took the first four bullet

1654
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:05,360
points on the right hand side that looks

1655
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:07,070
sufficient for a working group so I'd

1656
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,589
make it much more focused as I say just

1657
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:11,409
agree with what was just said take those

1658
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:13,610
top four bullets on the right hand side

1659
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:14,898
jettison the rest there's more than

1660
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:20,780
enough to be done it needs to be done

1661
01:13:14,899 --> 01:13:22,969
working group thank you fahan Baker

1662
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:28,550
could you go back to the slide with the

1663
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:31,059
bits that the next one I think yeah I'm

1664
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:33,349
very supportive of the idea of

1665
01:13:31,059 --> 01:13:36,499
alternative ways of doing DNS resolution

1666
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:40,909
I proposed a few over you know the past

1667
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:43,938
ten years whatever I'm quite worried

1668
01:13:40,909 --> 01:13:47,478
about this whole thing and the way it's

1669
01:13:43,939 --> 01:13:50,559
been presented here I'm really worried

1670
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:52,909
about this idea of full consensus

1671
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:56,859
because basically what you end up doing

1672
01:13:52,909 --> 01:14:00,638
is by you give a pre-emptive veto on

1673
01:13:56,859 --> 01:14:00,639
certain approaches

1674
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:07,610
and you know all security is going to

1675
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:10,249
change the balance of power it's always

1676
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:12,619
going to take security SI power away

1677
01:14:10,249 --> 01:14:14,900
from one group of people and give it to

1678
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:17,058
another and if that group of people

1679
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:22,638
you're taking it away from is criminals

1680
01:14:17,059 --> 01:14:24,949
that's a good thing the question though

1681
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:27,829
you know we tend to focus on who are you

1682
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:30,619
taking the power away from and what we

1683
01:14:27,829 --> 01:14:33,558
don't focus on enough is who you're

1684
01:14:30,619 --> 01:14:36,259
giving it to and I think that this is

1685
01:14:33,559 --> 01:14:38,420
one of the problems with doe was that it

1686
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:40,099
wasn't you know people thought oh we're

1687
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:41,900
taking it away from the people who are

1688
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:44,749
intercepting and doing these bad stuff

1689
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:47,150
and you didn't think closely enough as

1690
01:14:44,749 --> 01:14:49,880
to who you were giving the power to

1691
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:52,280
instead and how they were going to be

1692
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:55,880
accountable and what I think that we

1693
01:14:52,280 --> 01:15:00,889
need to do is always think about giving

1694
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:03,800
power to the user to the individual and

1695
01:15:00,889 --> 01:15:10,309
whenever you do that you're doing the

1696
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:11,239
right thing back microphone okay a rebel

1697
01:15:10,309 --> 01:15:13,460
si si

1698
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:15,110
I think there's definitely some very

1699
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:17,809
interesting work to be done

1700
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:19,639
I don't think AR T is the place to do it

1701
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:21,440
I view DNS as fundamentally it's a

1702
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:23,719
system service not an application

1703
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,339
service and the bulk of those items that

1704
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:28,039
I see there on that list I think a

1705
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:35,510
perfect fit for int area scope and it

1706
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:37,099
should not be part of AR T so I think we

1707
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:39,139
should form this working group I mean

1708
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:41,719
we've talked a couple of light years now

1709
01:15:39,139 --> 01:15:43,999
about the problems and we haven't got

1710
01:15:41,719 --> 01:15:45,289
any closer to resolution and I think one

1711
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,420
of the reasons is that we have don't

1712
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:49,940
have a structured discussion isn't and

1713
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,440
that's what I was hoping we'll get when

1714
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:53,419
we have that working group to actually

1715
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:57,138
get the stuff done and when you look at

1716
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:59,389
the to the left and right side I mean if

1717
01:15:57,139 --> 01:16:00,769
you think the left side through a lot of

1718
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:05,829
the stuff on the right side she comes

1719
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:05,829
through so just I mean get it done

1720
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:13,809
okay Paul machine I have just gone

1721
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:17,469
through the draft the draft charter and

1722
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:20,310
the latest changes mention about dealing

1723
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:23,380
with topics such as smaller detection

1724
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:25,840
privacy and pervasive surveillance and

1725
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:27,489
also policy controls don't you think

1726
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,770
that you are handling more than you can

1727
01:16:27,489 --> 01:16:31,929
chew given that you also mentioned you

1728
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:41,040
need full consensus and that's not easy

1729
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:44,200
to get thank you oh yeah Chris box bTW

1730
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:47,019
so I support the creation of awakened

1731
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:51,190
group to solve this if you go to the

1732
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:53,920
previous slide please so I'd like that

1733
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:57,129
working group to have a specific narrow

1734
01:16:53,920 --> 01:17:00,040
achievable focus which a lot of people

1735
01:16:57,130 --> 01:17:02,830
have said I totally agree with that so

1736
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:05,739
the list on the left there is a little

1737
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:09,460
short the one on the right you could

1738
01:17:05,739 --> 01:17:11,860
trim a couple of items from that but

1739
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:13,900
yeah essentially the message is make it

1740
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:16,389
make it short and applicable and

1741
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:19,799
achievable so that we can make some

1742
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:22,989
progress and the other thing is yes

1743
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:24,940
somehow or other work out one working

1744
01:17:22,989 --> 01:17:27,790
group that is going to address dis

1745
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:29,200
resolve with discovery I don't mind

1746
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:34,440
where it is it just needs to be in one

1747
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:36,370
place plan D and Comcast NBC Universal

1748
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,629
couple comments first of all I do

1749
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:40,540
support the creation of the working

1750
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:42,190
group I think it's going we eat with

1751
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:44,590
either lists left or right it has some

1752
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:48,009
very valuable topics on there which the

1753
01:17:44,590 --> 01:17:50,590
community of both users and I CFR is

1754
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:52,570
really good benefit from people getting

1755
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:56,080
together and working on so I think it's

1756
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:57,700
important there's material in the

1757
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,950
Charter and other discussions here

1758
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,470
though about creating a sort of an

1759
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:04,330
adjunct or a modified ITF process for

1760
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:06,580
getting through the contentious parts of

1761
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:09,130
this I think that's a mistake I believe

1762
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:11,350
in the ITF process it can be painful at

1763
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:12,640
times but I believe built into it is

1764
01:18:11,350 --> 01:18:15,070
ways of getting through these

1765
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,560
contentious issues sometimes by the way

1766
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:19,179
are the ITF process results in no

1767
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,790
consensus and that is an indicator

1768
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:22,320
that's valid

1769
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:25,560
we don't have to always drive to an

1770
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,400
answer but I think there's work we can

1771
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,990
get to an answer

1772
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:30,750
I think there's especially if we

1773
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:34,170
eliminate discussions which are very

1774
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:35,760
policy centric that gets into territory

1775
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:37,800
that is sort of outside the scope of the

1776
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:39,530
traditional ITF and I think maybe that

1777
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:42,780
would remove some of the crazier

1778
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:44,910
contentious feelings that go on and

1779
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:46,620
limit and focus the work to something

1780
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:48,960
that could produce results so exactly

1781
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:50,519
what I said Mady delist I'm just up here

1782
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:57,900
at the microphone repeating it so I

1783
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:59,390
support creation change I support

1784
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,589
education about working group

1785
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:03,150
specifically a new working group with it

1786
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:04,860
because I think we need a community

1787
01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:07,530
which is broader than the dinosaur pond

1788
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:09,960
and this is because there is actual

1789
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:11,969
technical work that is to be done I mean

1790
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:13,560
there are three different deployment

1791
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:15,630
models that are emerging and rather than

1792
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,970
arguing and you see which of the three

1793
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:19,530
is better I think put three all three of

1794
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,880
them need some technical parts are

1795
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:22,559
missing I mean the people that want to

1796
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,380
use DoD and the people that want to use

1797
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,510
geo HPT existing solvers need the

1798
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:31,410
resolve discovery part and possibly

1799
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:33,660
other ponies discovery path additional

1800
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:35,460
things the people that want to do H to

1801
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:37,440
their own is order or multiple solvers

1802
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,970
now realize that they still need to

1803
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,469
discover whether there is any local

1804
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:41,820
policy so that all the Kennelly domain

1805
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:44,130
is coming up and that is also something

1806
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:46,110
that needs to be standardized because I

1807
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:49,890
mean seen from the view of from the

1808
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:51,269
viewpoint of a DNS operator I hope I

1809
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:53,400
will not have to support the ten

1810
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:55,080
different cannily domain mechanisms to

1811
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:57,150
be compatible with all ten different

1812
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,820
clients that might want to go that way

1813
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:01,830
so I think that there is some pretty

1814
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:04,530
urgent I'd say technical work that needs

1815
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:06,960
to be done to actually make deployment

1816
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:10,530
of entropy DNS more quicker and more

1817
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:12,450
broadly adopted I will also point out

1818
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:14,280
that I mean I I love discussing that the

1819
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:16,650
second slide not the police part of the

1820
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:18,960
hardest issues but I also think that

1821
01:20:16,650 --> 01:20:20,570
this is not the right place maybe

1822
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,890
possibly to to have that discussion

1823
01:20:20,570 --> 01:20:24,809
first of all because there are other

1824
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:26,190
people as a non-technical stakeholders

1825
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:27,540
that want to be involved in those

1826
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:30,830
discussions and that are already

1827
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:32,850
discussing this I mean so I think

1828
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:33,719
especially they people that are going

1829
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:35,489
for third more than

1830
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:36,840
we'll hear from governments from the

1831
01:20:35,489 --> 01:20:38,610
protection authorities from law

1832
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,349
enforcement people about all the

1833
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:41,880
problems that they're deploying model is

1834
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:43,800
causing and then I don't want to enter

1835
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,170
in that's right that's wrong and how the

1836
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,429
discussion will in that but they think

1837
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:49,199
this is a discussion that is much

1838
01:20:47,429 --> 01:20:51,389
broader than the IDF in the technical

1839
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:54,030
community so I think it's even better

1840
01:20:51,389 --> 01:20:55,469
maybe if we don't have it here thank you

1841
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:57,090
just a quick note we only have ten

1842
01:20:55,469 --> 01:20:59,039
minutes left in the session and nine

1843
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:06,719
people in line so please keep pieces

1844
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:09,659
things succinctly two minutes rich sauce

1845
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:11,519
Akamai I don't have much of an opinion

1846
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:13,320
but if it goes in with the process

1847
01:21:11,519 --> 01:21:15,989
changes that I'm very strongly opposed

1848
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:17,969
to forming a working group I've given

1849
01:21:15,989 --> 01:21:20,098
the newcomers tutorial for about three

1850
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:22,320
years now and two points that we make

1851
01:21:20,099 --> 01:21:25,260
our rough consensus not everybody has to

1852
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:29,429
get all their answers solved and a we

1853
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:31,860
succeeded making a standard if if it

1854
01:21:29,429 --> 01:21:34,380
gets deployed and so if somebody can

1855
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:37,499
veto discussion or a thread that might

1856
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:39,179
be prevent them from participating then

1857
01:21:37,499 --> 01:21:41,849
this thing is not gonna get universally

1858
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:43,769
deployed so it'll fail well I'd really

1859
01:21:41,849 --> 01:21:45,929
hate for us to do something also that is

1860
01:21:43,769 --> 01:21:48,630
against our history no actual real point

1861
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:50,699
of pride right the slide rough consensus

1862
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:52,199
and running code Oh accepted this one

1863
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:55,469
group where it's only running code that

1864
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:58,589
counts also I want to point out we had

1865
01:21:55,469 --> 01:22:01,229
an example in the TLS group I'll use the

1866
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:03,420
phrase Enterprise TLS right with static

1867
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:05,460
RSA and the way we got around it the way

1868
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:07,409
we addressed it is we got consensus

1869
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:10,110
within the group to stop discussing it

1870
01:22:07,409 --> 01:22:12,119
and that's that's what you should do

1871
01:22:10,110 --> 01:22:14,369
here if when you find problems that are

1872
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:16,049
gonna prevent forward progress the group

1873
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:17,820
can say oh yeah it's more important for

1874
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:19,979
us to do progress therefore we will have

1875
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:21,449
consensus to stop it and it's up to the

1876
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:24,749
chairs to not let the topic come back

1877
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:26,308
thank you someone Thompson I'm gonna go

1878
01:22:24,749 --> 01:22:28,499
back to what Patrick the Menace said

1879
01:22:26,309 --> 01:22:30,900
here and I'm hearing from a lot of

1880
01:22:28,499 --> 01:22:33,630
people that they want to do this in a

1881
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:36,749
working group without specifying what

1882
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:39,239
this is and from this set of things that

1883
01:22:36,749 --> 01:22:40,800
you have AB on screen here I don't know

1884
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:43,018
that we're talking about the same thing

1885
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,479
and I suspect that the problem here

1886
01:22:43,019 --> 01:22:47,580
could be addressed simply by saying oh

1887
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:48,660
well we had a great discussion about

1888
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,610
sorts of things that people might want

1889
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:52,680
want to do in this room here but if we

1890
01:22:50,610 --> 01:22:55,620
want to continue we need to have more

1891
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:58,440
concrete and focused discussions about

1892
01:22:55,620 --> 01:23:01,050
specific things probably backed by as

1893
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:04,500
rich pointed out some sort of running

1894
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:06,780
code or at least specific proposals and

1895
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:09,780
I I saw one on the screen today that was

1896
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:13,530
working group sized almost you know from

1897
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:16,320
Tommy which I thought was maybe this

1898
01:23:13,530 --> 01:23:18,300
organization wants to take that on and I

1899
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,480
heard a number of different things from

1900
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:23,220
different people on this list and I

1901
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:27,509
think that if we set something up with

1902
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:32,460
this sort of octopus style scope we're

1903
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:39,720
going to fail in ways that new ways that

1904
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:43,500
I can't imagine yes I think echo is in

1905
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:47,070
line first okay I think you actually

1906
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:50,430
hear first but I'm happy to talk yeah on

1907
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:53,429
so now six minutes from the end of the

1908
01:23:50,430 --> 01:23:54,600
session so um you know truthfully we try

1909
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:57,570
to end these things with some sort of

1910
01:23:54,600 --> 01:24:01,050
hums that maybe that's not possible but

1911
01:23:57,570 --> 01:24:02,700
I'd like to see if maybe we can um so um

1912
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:03,960
you know back in the day when used to

1913
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:05,070
actually try to edit these charters in

1914
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:08,550
the screen and that was except for cool

1915
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:11,309
um so I'm gonna like make a save one of

1916
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:14,250
those things like a charter that

1917
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:16,500
basically has the first three items on

1918
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:18,570
this list on the right do people want to

1919
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,650
do and nothing else and a recharter for

1920
01:24:18,570 --> 01:24:24,059
later than that now something could

1921
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:26,580
actually home on a lot shirt this is

1922
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:32,370
exactly the thing a lot perfect yes um

1923
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:33,930
like um I mean I think there's no sense

1924
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:37,200
there's no sense in which we could do

1925
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:39,600
hung on a this that was like any any any

1926
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,920
you like did with the discussion we've

1927
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:42,690
had so far that wasn't like that like

1928
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:44,940
hyper concrete like I just described so

1929
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:46,290
um like now maybe we can do nothing and

1930
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:47,250
say like there's no consensus but if you

1931
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,970
want if you want to get consensus on

1932
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,270
something it's gonna have to be

1933
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:50,270
something like that

1934
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:58,160
hi cursed EP & CSC so I just wanted to

1935
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:59,780
note some of their changes and the

1936
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:02,000
topics that were suggested to be

1937
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:04,009
contentious so one of them is about the

1938
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,320
detection and suppression of malware

1939
01:25:04,010 --> 01:25:08,390
which I'd like to think at least the aim

1940
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,750
is not contentious whether you disagree

1941
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:13,640
on the method fine but I'd like to hope

1942
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:15,380
their least everyone can agree roughly

1943
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:18,130
on the aim that it's not a good thing in

1944
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:20,360
2019 to not at least discuss it and

1945
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:22,460
currently with DNS we see a lot of

1946
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:24,589
benefit from various malware filtering

1947
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:26,870
solutions it's all evidence we have the

1948
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:30,230
protective DNS service in the UK which

1949
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:31,580
has been shown to provide great malware

1950
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:34,190
defense actually and we've got quite a

1951
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:35,510
lot statistics to back that up and what

1952
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:38,178
I would like to see is some discussion

1953
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:39,890
about a users security experience not

1954
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:42,770
being degraded without their knowledge

1955
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:44,870
and I think to suppress any discussion

1956
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:47,719
around that is really quite a dangerous

1957
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:49,070
thing and I'm for forming a working

1958
01:25:47,719 --> 01:25:51,110
group I think these are very important

1959
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:55,940
issues that need to be discussed Thank

1960
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:58,130
You Ezra Barnes I'll be real brief I

1961
01:25:55,940 --> 01:26:00,349
there I feel like there there is

1962
01:25:58,130 --> 01:26:02,810
probably a working group in somewhere in

1963
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:04,219
this that I could support I do not

1964
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,719
support the formation of a working group

1965
01:26:04,219 --> 01:26:07,219
with any of the Charter versions

1966
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:10,670
heretofore produced

1967
01:26:07,219 --> 01:26:13,520
I think Elissa Cooper and Patrick

1968
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:15,800
McManus kind of broadly got the the the

1969
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,690
right approach here which is that we

1970
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:19,610
need to have some tight focus with clear

1971
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:23,660
deliverables that we can produce some

1972
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:25,880
value on which may be among the set here

1973
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:28,190
I think yeah as was mentioned Tommy's

1974
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:30,890
draft to capture some of them as well

1975
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:32,509
probably this kind of local network

1976
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:34,250
capability discovery local resolver

1977
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:36,199
capability discovery is is the right

1978
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:37,760
zone but I think we need a charter that

1979
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:40,629
is much more tightly focused on that

1980
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,630
before we can make any progress

1981
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:50,889
so I'm gonna be brief so I support but

1982
01:26:48,130 --> 01:26:53,950
reached mention so the consensus should

1983
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:56,350
not provide the right to veto there's a

1984
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:58,720
first thing and the other thing it's

1985
01:26:56,350 --> 01:27:01,240
it's not because we were trying to

1986
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:04,420
address hard question that we should not

1987
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:09,000
try to address those so I don't want to

1988
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:09,000
remove those question from the Charter

1989
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:18,760
Elliot leer two points first of all

1990
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:22,179
we've heard a lot about how we shouldn't

1991
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:24,640
innovate process we shouldn't we we need

1992
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:26,440
tight charters to to accomplish work

1993
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:29,350
we've identified some work that that can

1994
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:31,299
be accomplished of course a working

1995
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:34,270
group is not the only vehicle that this

1996
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,100
organization has and it seems to me the

1997
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:38,260
items on the right at least most of them

1998
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:39,460
are worth discussing it doesn't mean

1999
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:41,620
they have to be discussed in a working

2000
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:42,910
group they can be discussed in an IAB

2001
01:27:41,620 --> 01:27:44,320
program they can be discussed at a

2002
01:27:42,910 --> 01:27:47,349
workshop they can be discussed in the

2003
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:48,820
IRT F I think the point is that when we

2004
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:50,620
make changes to the architecture and

2005
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:52,360
there are ramification for those changes

2006
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:54,130
there needs to be a vehicle to discuss

2007
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:56,530
those changes doesn't have to be a

2008
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:57,940
working group but I would ask the IETF

2009
01:27:56,530 --> 01:28:00,490
leadership to consider the list on the

2010
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:03,490
right and figure out what vehicle the

2011
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:05,889
people should use for that for

2012
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:08,889
discussion and actually documentation of

2013
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:12,190
those issues we got here in in part

2014
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:14,050
because Jim and others wrote a draft it

2015
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:15,910
was controversial it doesn't mean that

2016
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:17,680
we have to have consensus on everything

2017
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:19,840
that he wrote and there are vehicles for

2018
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:22,380
producing work where there's no

2019
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,910
consensus I want to actually compliment

2020
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:26,710
Aubrey who was in the back I think she's

2021
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:29,889
over there we had a very controversial

2022
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:32,050
document come up in HR PC and she she

2023
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:33,730
actually discussed for instance the

2024
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:35,290
meaning of consensus and she wanted to

2025
01:28:33,730 --> 01:28:36,969
get even further but we ran out of time

2026
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:38,530
it was a really good she had a really

2027
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:40,720
good presentation and we should think

2028
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:42,340
about how we have those discussions

2029
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:44,140
because we should take responsibility

2030
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:46,030
for the architecture that we're

2031
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:48,190
delivering both the good points and the

2032
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:50,610
bad points I had a second point but I'll

2033
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:50,610
leave it at that

2034
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:55,090
really quickly we are down to just over

2035
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:57,610
a minute left and I want to actually

2036
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:59,500
defer to Barry and Alyssa as

2037
01:28:57,610 --> 01:29:01,960
as whether they are interested in any

2038
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:04,780
sort of even on the general question of

2039
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:07,090
our people generally in favor let's put

2040
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:10,210
the specific Charter aside right now but

2041
01:29:07,090 --> 01:29:13,270
generally in favor of focusing in a new

2042
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:15,130
working group or passing would be like

2043
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:16,690
one hum we could have I'm curious is

2044
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:18,280
there anything barrier ELISA would

2045
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:29,650
really like to hear from the end of this

2046
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:33,130
session listening to the mic discussion

2047
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:34,690
this is Barry after listening after

2048
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:38,440
listening to the mic discussions that

2049
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:40,660
better I don't see anything right now

2050
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:41,860
that we could make a hum on in the time

2051
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:45,730
that we don't have

2052
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:47,769
so let's defer that to the list

2053
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:50,860
I hear people wanting to work on

2054
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:52,720
something I hear people thinking we

2055
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:56,469
can't come up with an agreement on what

2056
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:58,390
we can work on and I hear pretty much

2057
01:29:56,470 --> 01:30:00,640
universal agreement that the list on the

2058
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:01,900
right is too much so we need to refine

2059
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:09,100
that on the mailing list

2060
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:11,139
I don't well that's a Cooper this is not

2061
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,670
really for today but you know we have

2062
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:14,230
the RFC about considerations on how to

2063
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:16,180
have a successful bluff and it has like

2064
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:17,679
very specific questions that are meant

2065
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:19,120
to be answered and if you think about

2066
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,680
them in advance then it kind of shapes

2067
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,820
the way the boff goes because then by

2068
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:23,890
the end you know that you have to get

2069
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:25,509
the answers and I was really hoping that

2070
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:28,060
that was gonna happen today and did it

2071
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:29,740
so now I think the task is to try to

2072
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:32,410
make that happen on the list which is

2073
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:34,599
much harder but I do still think like

2074
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:36,040
those questions should be framing

2075
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,290
people's thoughts and it's about like

2076
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:40,930
deliverables and who's gonna do the work

2077
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:42,940
and is this the right venue and so on so

2078
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:44,050
I would I would encourage you to look

2079
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:47,769
back at those even though the bluff is

2080
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:51,420
over and think about how you can try to

2081
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:51,420
test those on the list

2082
01:30:55,790 --> 01:31:00,180
yeah so you the three people left at the

2083
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:04,260
mic if you'd like to finish up with some

2084
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:06,530
comments I'll go up I'll be short name

2085
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:09,600
is Sanjay Mishra Verizon so I think

2086
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:13,620
applications are doing DNS so that's

2087
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:16,920
already the fact so I think keeping that

2088
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:18,900
fact in mind I support a working group

2089
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,490
that is specifically focused on so now

2090
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:22,049
the issue is actually that are listed in

2091
01:31:20,490 --> 01:31:23,630
the latest chap in the right hand side

2092
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:26,430
and I think it's a good list

2093
01:31:23,630 --> 01:31:27,810
controversial maybe to some on certain

2094
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:30,090
things but I think it's a good list and

2095
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:31,830
we should really try and see a consensus

2096
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:34,050
on what are the items that we can work

2097
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:35,970
on and this group might be a specific

2098
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:40,350
venue for those issues so I think I

2099
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:43,290
support forming a group here okay so I

2100
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:45,560
am amidst a forum for more Ranjha and we

2101
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:52,710
strongly support the original version

2102
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:54,810
here so discovery policy and BCP Brian

2103
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:57,960
Dixon godaddy of the list on the right

2104
01:31:54,810 --> 01:31:59,640
hand side I definitely am supporting the

2105
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:04,680
prime numbered ones two three five and

2106
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:06,690
seven thank you everyone for your time

2107
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:09,020
we'll be following up more on the

2108
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:09,019
mailing list
