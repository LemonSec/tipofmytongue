1
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:22,910
was marketing spin it's getting there

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,530
[Music]

3
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:07,500
good morning apologize it's fairly

4
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:13,829
rotten working group session and to

5
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:17,209
begin this apologize for delay so this

6
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:24,570
is an update on the work what we were

7
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:27,299
discussing in the working group and in

8
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,900
course of the presentation I'll try to

9
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:33,299
explain why I think that it might be

10
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:39,450
interesting for the RT g VG group not

11
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:43,200
only for BFD group so we are all well

12
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:47,480
familiar with the BFD and the

13
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,070
specification it's very successful

14
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,369
development design of the protocol that

15
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:58,640
being deployed in many networks over

16
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:06,930
different transports IP MPLS to the wire

17
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:11,488
so we are people are working on applique

18
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,720
it to overlay networks but now and then

19
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,880
especially in a B of D group since we're

20
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,660
the core

21
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:25,810
for their beauty protocol there are

22
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:29,720
proposals and discussions about some

23
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,480
extensions to BFD for example to monitor

24
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,070
the quality of beef this session because

25
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,640
BFD as a fault failure detection

26
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:45,200
protocol has some leverage of how many

27
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:49,250
messages in row it has has to be missed

28
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,490
in order to detect failure but what as

29
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:57,170
might be of interest is that to know for

30
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:59,960
example if the text multiplier is 3 so

31
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:02,150
how many really messages did we miss we

32
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,940
are receiving constantly each in every

33
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,150
message or we start missing one or two

34
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:14,840
messages but then third message arrives

35
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:17,739
and oh ok we keep the session up again

36
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,719
there are some proposals just to

37
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:27,140
evaluate the performance and path MTU

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:31,450
because BFD designed to be lightweight

39
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:35,330
and efficient it is on a very small

40
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:39,520
control message but there is interest to

41
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:45,770
see if we can do something more with it

42
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:50,409
so here's we came up with there some

43
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:57,590
ideas of how we can make BFD extended

44
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:59,840
extensible and another motivation was

45
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,099
that we have very interesting discussion

46
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,979
on authentication and BFD dedication and

47
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,230
BFD is sort of you configure it and you

48
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:14,960
must do it on issue in every packet so

49
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:20,030
if you can imagine if B if the interval

50
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,640
is 3.3 milliseconds or at that rate so

51
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,700
that doing F indication and Asian every

52
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,500
packet in both directions that's kind of

53
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:33,479
heavy load on a system

54
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:37,120
there is a proposal that working group

55
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:41,910
completed discussing and progressing

56
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,040
further that to do intermittent

57
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:48,300
authentication for busy session but

58
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:51,340
there are some other issues that really

59
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,320
doesn't make it always at will so there

60
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,489
are some constraints to that especially

61
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,490
in a synchronous mode so let's move on

62
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:04,900
and get to the technical details so the

63
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,880
proposal is that because BFD control

64
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,429
message does not specify how its

65
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,700
encapsulated in a transport it only

66
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,350
defines the control message and the size

67
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,890
as I mentioned it's a fixed

68
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,420
whether it's unallocated mode or

69
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:22,570
authenticated mode for authenticated

70
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:27,490
mode it's predictable so our proposal is

71
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:30,400
this to have VFD control message for

72
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,860
proud idea of a guard Ward just for

73
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,909
safety to separate it and then followed

74
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,480
by govt until we can have enclosed sub t

75
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:44,020
Obi's so that makes it extensible well

76
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:50,320
at the same time of course might be not

77
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:53,440
as Hardware friendly so to understand

78
00:07:50,320 --> 00:08:00,159
whether it's regular BFD control message

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:03,610
or extended of course because BFD at

80
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:08,530
least in IP network works over UDP

81
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:18,510
we need to look at the UDP length length

82
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:21,960
field in a UDP header dfd itself has a

83
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:30,360
negotiation process three-way handshake

84
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:33,929
exchanging the discriminators yes that

85
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,930
handshake can be

86
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:41,779
substituted by some communication in the

87
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,110
control plane and one of the examples is

88
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:48,630
beardy over MPLS LSP when LSP thing is

89
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,589
used to bootstrap leave this session

90
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:59,610
another example could be as what we what

91
00:08:52,589 --> 00:09:04,740
is proposed for MVP n to use extension

92
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:13,380
in the DGP there is another example in

93
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:18,470
TMS m4d rbdr fest fell over to advertise

94
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:23,579
BGP discriminator in pin hello option

95
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:26,180
what we complement this negotiation is

96
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:31,680
with a capability negotiation between

97
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:35,699
BGP peers and so they can negotiate loss

98
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:39,500
measurement delay measurement path MTU

99
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:43,258
discovery monitoring and lightweight

100
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:49,639
authentication and as you notice each

101
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:53,759
field occupies two bit positions because

102
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:57,180
each of these modes envision be able to

103
00:09:53,759 --> 00:10:04,199
support it as part of periodic messages

104
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:12,750
or echo request reply which is supported

105
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:15,389
by pole final sequence in BFD and as in

106
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:19,319
every capability negotiation so the

107
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:23,699
active side announces its interest the

108
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:28,189
other side sends well it agrees to and

109
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:31,349
supports and then out of that they can

110
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:33,240
conclude what will be used

111
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,550
performance measurement the proposal is

112
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:40,860
to reuse encoding

113
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:44,160
defined in RFC 63 74 was until a

114
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,339
measurement over MPLS networks and the

115
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:54,630
nice part about it is that

116
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:58,550
these messages allowed to do separate

117
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:01,139
was delay measurement direct

118
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:07,399
measurements by collecting counters and

119
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:11,670
combined was delay measurement and

120
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:16,730
because of BFD this measurements can be

121
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:21,740
either unidirectional or bi-directional

122
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:26,300
unidirectional as part of period

123
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:31,199
periodic messages or bi-directional

124
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:35,760
using echo request reply or poke final

125
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:38,519
sequence and 63 74 supports one way to

126
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,899
fulness measurement and direct loss

127
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:47,670
measurement so this was just an

128
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:53,910
illustration of how in coatings from RFC

129
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:59,790
63 74 can be used in this integrated OEM

130
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:04,260
or extended BFD so we just using TLV to

131
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:09,019
encode their message that already

132
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:14,120
defined in RFC 63 74 for us measurement

133
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:20,250
for delay measurement and for combined

134
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:23,959
measurement and again it doesn't have to

135
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:28,410
be sent on high frequency or for example

136
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:31,109
BFD messages that monitor path

137
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:38,060
continuity but they can be sent as part

138
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:38,060
of their poor final sequence so then

139
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:49,330
the load on the system and it would be

140
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:53,939
not that challenging core path MTU

141
00:12:49,330 --> 00:13:00,720
monitoring it introduces basically

142
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:05,680
padding type of TLV which can have

143
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:10,810
arbitrary length centered and it can be

144
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:16,030
used as in the proposal be if the large

145
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:20,369
packets set to certain value and again

146
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:25,750
used in the PO final sequence to

147
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:31,900
casually and time-to-time monitor the

148
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:35,800
path and one of the benefits of using

149
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:39,520
poor final sequence is that it does not

150
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,760
interfere with their more frequent

151
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:47,290
exchange or transmission of periodic

152
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:51,939
messages by each side and then local

153
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:56,260
policy can set its own rules on when to

154
00:13:51,940 --> 00:14:00,910
constitute that link is down because it

155
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:05,200
could be reaction to not receiving final

156
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:07,329
message once or just two consecutive or

157
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:13,530
three consecutive so it could be really

158
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,530
independent local policy rule

159
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:19,630
authentication capability as I mentioned

160
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,080
the current definition of Education in

161
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:28,050
BFD applies to each and every packet and

162
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:32,710
that is quite severe burden on a system

163
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:36,130
that very aggressively monitors paths

164
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:41,740
between two systems and the proposal

165
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:46,180
here is that to give the Cape capability

166
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:48,420
of authenticating whether periodic

167
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,420
messages

168
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:58,290
for final messages or combination of

169
00:14:51,720 --> 00:15:01,589
both and again using 4-pole final

170
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:04,230
messages like an MTU it gives a local

171
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:07,730
policy opportunity to define the rules

172
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:14,579
when they declare that session is

173
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:17,930
invalid so this diagram is just a

174
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:21,180
caption of how the lightweight

175
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:29,269
authentication will work in the poll

176
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:36,589
final sequence and it basically defines

177
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:42,410
for now one of the protocols only to use

178
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:44,699
hashing function so the next steps we

179
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,529
will continue will continue the

180
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:52,370
discussion in B of the working group and

181
00:15:48,529 --> 00:15:57,809
we welcome your comments questions and

182
00:15:52,370 --> 00:16:03,199
suggestions whether you see any interest

183
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:03,199
or use of this integrated OEM protocol

184
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:12,480
hi integrate with Charter Communications

185
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,829
interesting draft I shall like it one

186
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,290
quick question I had while we're

187
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:17,790
scrolling through it and I've only had

188
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,740
one cup of coffees and that might be

189
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,839
impacting things as well how does micro

190
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:29,189
BFD play into this if we're doing this

191
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:31,110
across lags micros BFD because I'm I saw

192
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:34,639
I'm not familiar with the micro Beauty I

193
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:40,800
know there is a SB of the technology

194
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:44,399
micro be of the video good okay thank

195
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:54,240
you I forgot about it yes you have a

196
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:58,079
better memory and okay so again so BD /

197
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,870
lag spans single hop sessions over each

198
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,409
constituent link it's a good question

199
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:09,640
I think that might be applicability

200
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:12,670
again because this draft allows you this

201
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:17,350
mechanism allows you to use only this

202
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:19,570
extensions over poor final sequence okay

203
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:23,819
and and I think that poor final sequence

204
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:28,629
will go only one not on each individual

205
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:30,790
leg right agent but okay I will have to

206
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,550
admit now I'm speculating I haven't

207
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,980
thought about it I will I would say from

208
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,090
our perspective there would be a fair

209
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,070
amount of interest and having that

210
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,840
either in the negotiation or the

211
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,090
capability negotiation or something like

212
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,020
that adding that in because a lot of our

213
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:51,639
sessions are over many many yes as I

214
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:56,200
remember this RFC basically what it does

215
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:58,480
it just automate creation of single hub

216
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,390
give these sessions over constituents

217
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:06,570
session itself has known distinction

218
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:10,540
from single hobby of the accession ye

219
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,460
pretty much yes but my understanding of

220
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,040
it is it's a capability that needs to be

221
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,600
distinctly enabled on both sides so

222
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,399
since we're already negotiating

223
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,679
basically all the other parameters at

224
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,260
the same time it might be my

225
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,550
understanding that each individual

226
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,990
session comes up individually

227
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:31,480
independently of all other sessions and

228
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,280
other constituents Greg sorry it has to

229
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,690
interact with min links configured it's

230
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
more complex than what you're saying

231
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,420
okay

232
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,000
okay but again as I said thank you for

233
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,470
the question I haven't thought about it

234
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,590
we're working it all right oh you know

235
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:48,430
you as well about it thank you

236
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:50,350
and from my perspective the micro baby

237
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:52,120
is very widely deployed technology very

238
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,219
useful and should definitely be

239
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,409
considered when you work on the next

240
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:00,070
version lecture narration thank you

241
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:02,590
hi Tony Lee arista I should probably

242
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,260
know we've been trying to get BFD into

243
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:08,290
hardware for a long time now and of

244
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:13,110
course this makes it harder is there any

245
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:17,550
way we could do this not in BFD

246
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:23,909
well one of the proposals is to have a

247
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:28,560
protocol which inherits some of BFD nice

248
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:32,490
features like timer negotiation and some

249
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:38,010
robustness and basically we have a new

250
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:40,380
protocol known BFD which doesn't which

251
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:46,230
uses a different well-known destination

252
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:49,020
port follow-up the question Louis Chan

253
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,060
from juniper so we'll consider because I

254
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,760
know that is like a piggyback or the TLV

255
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:57,510
in a one package right if I'm not wrong

256
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,340
not all of them are I would probably say

257
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:05,280
that I don't see the reason to piggyback

258
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:07,939
might be I mean maybe if you if you if

259
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,230
you do some extension cords

260
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,450
authentication yes you might have two

261
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,710
TVs and authentication will be the last

262
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:19,950
one but I would not see the real need

263
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,420
for more than one TLV okay the reason

264
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,280
why I asked that because is if you

265
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,080
separate a different tier V in two

266
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,300
different packets then easy to implement

267
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,990
hardware for I mean the gum responds

268
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:35,460
yeah and again to your question of Tony

269
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:38,340
question I want to stress that there is

270
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,180
no requirement to do it in the periodic

271
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:45,629
messages all these extensions can work

272
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,170
in a poll final sequence and the poll

273
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:52,680
final sequence usually is processed

274
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:54,510
well at least as bump in the wire so if

275
00:20:52,680 --> 00:21:02,910
not in control plane then bump in the

276
00:20:54,510 --> 00:21:06,410
water so okay well thank you for your

277
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:09,240
comments and especially I appreciate the

278
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:13,400
suggestion to look into micro be of the

279
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,400
use case thank you

280
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:42,370
step is Shunsuke Homa good morning

281
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:45,850
everybody my name is June sky and I'm a

282
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:50,080
researcher of entity laboratories this

283
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:54,279
draft was originally proposed in calm

284
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,830
spot and its first time to present this

285
00:21:54,279 --> 00:22:00,159
graphic in this working group so I will

286
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,820
talk about digest or content of this

287
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,809
draft and introduce our related walk in

288
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,809
this presentation

289
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:19,200
okay okay so okay so firstly either I

290
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:23,860
will talk about the background of this

291
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:28,200
document so as you know devices and

292
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:32,850
services die bussing and network will be

293
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:37,240
required to apply to such diversity and

294
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:41,668
networks rising is emerging approach to

295
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:45,600
apply networks to such diversity so and

296
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:50,909
several SDOs discussing about it

297
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:56,918
including CDC VP so and ITF had started

298
00:22:50,909 --> 00:23:00,009
to discuss transports right so instead

299
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:03,460
works rising end-to-end networks right a

300
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:06,610
quick realization of end-to-end networks

301
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,610
rise is very important therefore provide

302
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:13,449
assured communication quality for each

303
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:17,019
service and 3gpp has three subnet

304
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:18,970
concept threats or a subnet is a group

305
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:24,510
of network functions and connectivity

306
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:27,309
and end-to-end rice will be composed of

307
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,919
one or more subnet

308
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:32,830
a prisoner that this

309
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:37,600
definition and terminology different

310
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:39,100
from one of the two oxidized design team

311
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,168
in peace

312
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:49,990
they don't use subnet for represent this

313
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:54,159
concept answer for creating and to

314
00:23:49,990 --> 00:24:01,029
enterprise stitching of subnets will be

315
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:03,190
required in a nation to teaching subnet

316
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:06,520
several functionality would be liquid

317
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:09,700
for printing and provide network

318
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:13,210
services for example resurrection us

319
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,360
control encapsulation decapsulation etc

320
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:19,500
and thrust Gateway provides such

321
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:26,260
functionality at each boundary of

322
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:29,470
domains this slide shows a requirements

323
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:34,059
for thrust gateway service gateway will

324
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:37,299
provide mainly two types roll a faster

325
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:42,149
is handling underlying infrastructure to

326
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:46,539
create slices secondly is provide

327
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:49,600
providing controllability of user

328
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:53,080
traffic to tenant we are assuming that

329
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,500
prices will be provided to sort of

330
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:01,899
parties or tenant and they use network

331
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:06,909
services as part of their own service so

332
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:10,000
some tenant may need to control the user

333
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:13,570
traffic on thrice so let's get away

334
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,809
provides such functionalities so this

335
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:21,760
matrix reached the requirements for

336
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:23,830
thrust gateway so and this figure shows

337
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,559
the overview of the thrust gateway

338
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:30,039
structure as resgate aware is composed

339
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,370
of thrust gateway function transfer

340
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:37,690
gateway controller and several data rank

341
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:40,570
entity data plane entities and rest

342
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:42,970
gateway controller has two types of

343
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:45,370
api's first two is four

344
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,370
managing slices and it's corrected to

345
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,168
the higher operation system higher level

346
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:54,309
operation systems such as Orchestrator

347
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:57,490
and second is for controlling user

348
00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:02,370
traffic on slices and it's open to the

349
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:07,390
tenant and tenant can control their

350
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:09,658
customer traffic on slices and in the

351
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,350
following few strides either introduced

352
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:24,130
related work on our related work on

353
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:27,070
Westgate away so into MF we proceed we

354
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:31,210
are proceeding the average aberration

355
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:33,990
test feasibility test of creation of M

356
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,270
to n slice across multiple

357
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:42,159
administrative domains if this figure

358
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:46,389
shows a scenario of POC MF and oak

359
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:50,620
several orchestrators who played each

360
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:55,200
other and create thrice subnet in each

361
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:56,320
domain and first gate away connect the

362
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,140
subnets

363
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:07,629
and create end-to-end fries this is

364
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:14,230
proper exhibited in the MEF 2019 and it

365
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:25,480
one award this year's MEF award in this

366
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:27,549
year second is a feasibility test of BL

367
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,730
pimping applications as future

368
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:34,629
application so entity and GQ

369
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:39,659
technologies developed we're pimping as

370
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:42,850
a and gratifying the what requirement

371
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:47,850
such application pad and how to

372
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:51,280
collaborate application and network so

373
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:54,309
we're pimping is composed of several

374
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,930
types of applications so players

375
00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:00,830
audience and viewers

376
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:04,490
a player's play people in the brea space

377
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:08,540
and you can enter the same real space as

378
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:12,140
audience and can watch Pimpin game

379
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,510
nearby players and this content also

380
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:21,230
provides a bit of streaming and you can

381
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:26,960
watch the people game with tablet or PC

382
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:29,660
and these applications has different we

383
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,790
comment on communication so for example

384
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,270
player players people and the people

385
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:37,070
cause high speed or re so low latency

386
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:40,580
communication is very important and

387
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:43,730
people game is the most important factor

388
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,129
in this content and so the traffic must

389
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:49,340
be protected on the other hand because

390
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:52,370
dreaming doesn't require real-time

391
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:55,909
communication it requires just broadband

392
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:59,559
so we prepared the several types of

393
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:02,450
slices and game application select

394
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:06,470
appropriate slices so for example

395
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:11,080
players that the pimp on earth the game

396
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:15,710
and game Saba recognized the device has

397
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:19,490
players loan so request a central

398
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:23,990
request to allocate such traffic to the

399
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:29,000
players thrice and this content can walk

400
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:36,050
even if traffic congestion happens we

401
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:41,200
okay so this is just example of API so a

402
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:44,659
game application sends requests

403
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,320
including flow identifier and trans

404
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:51,880
rights ID and so as gateway controller

405
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:56,240
translates the API to the concrete

406
00:29:51,880 --> 00:30:02,510
network configuration and enforce it to

407
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:05,380
the discipline entity so game

408
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:10,460
application don't require to understand

409
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:15,169
concrete network topology or conflation

410
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:18,820
in this model so finally I would talk

411
00:30:15,169 --> 00:30:24,110
about next step of this document so with

412
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:26,990
pruning to breaking down a nose one

413
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:30,610
interface with leaf or link definition

414
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:34,639
and sophistication of n s DT in this

415
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:39,469
working group also we provide a use case

416
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:44,240
is where SSD or subnet concept will be

417
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:49,369
beneficial anyway so we have very few

418
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:52,220
feedback and so please read this draft

419
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:54,399
and send your feedback thank you very

420
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,399
much

421
00:30:54,700 --> 00:31:04,639
equations speaking of the design team

422
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,159
member not as working group chair I'm

423
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:09,289
very happy with your next steps the step

424
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,940
number one we are allowing terminology

425
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,519
so for example it would be highly

426
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,049
unstable to say it's a subnet we know

427
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,369
that sublet is not what they meant right

428
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:20,360
so I would really expect you to use

429
00:31:18,369 --> 00:31:22,970
terminology and the coverage that we

430
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,248
have established in design team knew

431
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:27,440
your document and fide right place and

432
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:30,409
here are key of controllers if you wish

433
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,429
where it really belongs with regards the

434
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:36,889
northbound communication to really going

435
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:40,100
down to particular technology yeah so

436
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:42,918
this documentary is published in ITF so

437
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,830
the terminologies should be idea

438
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:48,860
friendly so I will change I modified so

439
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:51,590
do you think you know the regime yeah

440
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,719
Dave Allen Erickson just a quick

441
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:55,999
question for clarification I'm trying to

442
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,690
understand the relationship between the

443
00:31:55,999 --> 00:32:02,299
slicing gateway and the UPF and the 5g

444
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,850
architecture and how that relates to the

445
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:08,149
various interfaces yes so stressing it

446
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:11,658
away it's not device so it's just

447
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:18,229
definition so I've provide a mapping

448
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:23,029
this functionality to 5g systems okay

449
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:25,350
yeah that's in the draft okay thank you

450
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:28,559
children from Hawaii yeah actually I

451
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:32,490
think it is very useful to specify the

452
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:37,740
use cases which you have already think

453
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:41,220
about our very mat in which can be used

454
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:45,090
for the novel slicing and can document

455
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:53,419
it here this will be very useful thank

456
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:53,418
you thank you thank you

457
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,379
next up is evangelist hello pretties

458
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:31,649
hello my name is Angus Holly police and

459
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:33,689
closer this is better great so my name

460
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:38,219
is evangelist Holly please and on behalf

461
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:42,480
of my colleagues I'd like to present you

462
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,309
our take off force based PNG by the way

463
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,409
my activities are carried with funding

464
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:52,350
provided by the sand iced tea initiative

465
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:54,629
from you with 78 0 for 39 program grant

466
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:57,779
agreement under the horizon 2020 program

467
00:33:54,629 --> 00:34:00,209
so I don't know how many of you saw the

468
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:07,139
mail yesterday that the IDF is not going

469
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:11,129
to continue activity on the PNG our take

470
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:13,879
is that the IDF has already existing

471
00:34:11,129 --> 00:34:17,668
solutions that can address this and can

472
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:20,429
provide solutions for separating

473
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:23,190
controlled and foreign plane ok

474
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:26,629
I mean since you brought the topic up

475
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:29,970
there was a liaison yesterday from the

476
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:34,589
iesg to broadband forum that basically

477
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:36,299
said you know work on disaggregated B

478
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:38,400
and G had been suspended

479
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,270
the IHF in March and that suspension

480
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:45,750
will continue until you know a decision

481
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:49,409
a change in decision is made by request

482
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:52,889
from BBF or something so like moving

483
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,989
forward I guess you're saying like

484
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:58,859
forces is a technology that could be

485
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:02,750
reused right for Eng yes which is good

486
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:06,930
but based on you know the IES G's

487
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:09,990
feedback in the future like we we

488
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:12,779
probably won't be allocating time to

489
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:15,569
discussion of this but you know so sorry

490
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,710
if like BBF wanted to look at forces and

491
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,310
say oh that's really good and then

492
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,340
request

493
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,390
oh hey forces is great that's fine but

494
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:25,050
we're not going to be allocating time

495
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:28,170
until there's any change in that so what

496
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,120
we're going to you know focus that this

497
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:35,640
is an ITF solution already that can

498
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:37,319
actually support this conditionals it

499
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,230
would be useful I guess since since you

500
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,640
brought the topic up you know it would

501
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,250
be good to just have a moment a

502
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,259
discussion about the liaison statement

503
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:51,600
and and so on I think that's what Dave

504
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,390
Cinetopia stood up for right yeah so

505
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,819
Davison crop' speaking is the IETF

506
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:59,190
liaison manager to BBF so yes that

507
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,610
liaison went out from the is G to be BFF

508
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,080
yesterday and it did you that was a

509
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,880
great summary Chris thank you it

510
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,420
basically said we're gonna suspend all

511
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,540
work on the disaggregated bng here

512
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:14,460
forces I can tell you was a topic for

513
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,270
discussion within the broadband forum

514
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,840
and while there has been a protocol

515
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:25,770
selection done for the control point to

516
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:28,050
user playing protocol which is PFC P

517
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:32,160
there's been two liaisons from BB F to

518
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:33,990
IETF say stating such you know topics

519
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,350
like this are always welcome in that

520
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,370
venue

521
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:40,740
thanks.thanks wouldn't say kiss D they

522
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:43,440
use the importance of having a data

523
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,540
model actually to support the protocol

524
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,190
that's one I'm sorry I can't hear you

525
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,109
there's a full-blown discussion and back

526
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,660
to me

527
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:52,999
they I think the importance of this talk

528
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,890
is that to showcase that having a data

529
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:56,959
model alongside the protocol is pretty

530
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,609
useful and it can support more than

531
00:36:56,959 --> 00:37:01,009
simply separation but can add more

532
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:02,569
functionality and and there is worship

533
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:05,119
there's also work there going on

534
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:07,969
regarding the data model and management

535
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,650
playing so I'd like to share some kind I

536
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:10,130
can talk you offline I got some of the

537
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:18,079
data

538
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:21,109
Thanks so Dan moved on which I would be

539
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,380
interested to see more on a distributed

540
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:27,348
architecture for a B and G but that

541
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,299
would be and for start implementation

542
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:30,950
independent unless you really have an

543
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:33,499
implementation that you can present the

544
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:39,618
results of that okay thanks for your

545
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:41,808
coming sure developers telefónica not in

546
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:46,549
the front page for the hem I'd be I feel

547
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:50,059
myself one of the accomplices of

548
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:52,579
evangelist for preparing this and our

549
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:54,529
original intent when we started talking

550
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:57,739
about this was precisely it's not only

551
00:37:54,529 --> 00:38:01,670
about VG's and this is why I believe

552
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:04,400
that this current title current focus is

553
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:07,069
somehow connected to this statement for

554
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,059
the AG but our intention was precisely

555
00:38:07,069 --> 00:38:14,209
to explore the idea of a unified

556
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:17,089
mechanisms for access yes call it being

557
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:21,078
G's call it whatever the 3gpp call its

558
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:24,469
on the in in 5g call it what you use for

559
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,049
cable connections is in general for the

560
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:30,650
access side of the of the internet that

561
00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:33,920
is for us is extremely important so it's

562
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:38,809
it's the beansie's usually it's most of

563
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:43,219
is a use case that we can showcase the

564
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:46,039
use of forces as well Greg music is it

565
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:49,190
II pretty much concur with the previous

566
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:53,299
statement that there are a lot of things

567
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:57,619
that can benefit from their control user

568
00:38:53,299 --> 00:39:00,890
played separation so I think that the

569
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:04,180
right way thing would be is just

570
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:07,160
cut them whether it's access network

571
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:09,680
specifically and then give the

572
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,290
requirements agree on the requirements

573
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,649
and see what the generality we can

574
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:20,830
produce again without any specifics of

575
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:23,000
talking about distributed vengi hmm I

576
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,230
was gonna conquer all the rest but I'm

577
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,360
not gonna repeat that I have a question

578
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,000
for you so how does the decision I saw

579
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:32,390
the report in regards to forces and the

580
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,510
BBF in Sim truck talking to magnet for

581
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:36,680
analysis the analysis of wave forces was

582
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,170
considered I think there was something

583
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,540
published how does the decision get made

584
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,460
do you this is the BBF contact somebody

585
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,950
through you and then you go and find the

586
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,020
forces people and have that discussion

587
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:52,970
because we I was never informed that the

588
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:55,250
BBFS so the the liaison statements are

589
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,629
public documents they get seminal on

590
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:59,060
your constitute I'm talking about the

591
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:02,240
process what is the process that the BBF

592
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:08,720
Raqqah process involves these public

593
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,729
liaison statements and then within my

594
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,259
question what is the process for the BBF

595
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:17,450
to request the IETF that they were

596
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:19,490
evaluating forces I suggest we take that

597
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:22,549
offline because that's VBF process

598
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:24,859
business that we really don't know about

599
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:27,940
and you can discuss it offline with

600
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:30,320
someone but it's not really our business

601
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:35,360
okay thank you so I have one less

602
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,620
comment to make I will say is a quite

603
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,930
kind of a public service announcement

604
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:41,330
which I didn't cover in the last time I

605
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:45,109
was at this mic the broadband forum has

606
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,670
actually changed their operating I would

607
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,530
say operating procedures but it's not

608
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:53,780
really procedures they've changed their

609
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:55,940
bylaws such that now anyone anyone can

610
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,220
approach the broadband forum pay a

611
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,930
subscription fee or an access fee and

612
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,779
get access to all of their work in

613
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:07,240
progress they are now nearly as open as

614
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,240
the IETF for a small fee

615
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,600
okay thanks thanks for that update so

616
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,649
since we've had what what okay we'll

617
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,480
have one more comment related to the

618
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:24,520
possible follow-up from Dave should it

619
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:26,620
be required on the liaison statement and

620
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,850
and that that aspect of this and then

621
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,270
we'll let you get on with your actual

622
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:33,839
presentation so we came from a kind of

623
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:38,380
mobile you'll know that there are about

624
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:40,120
3,000 to PGCE all up in the network the

625
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:43,110
protocol patron can opener are you

626
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:46,270
definitely the wedding hall scene for us

627
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:50,440
when Muhammad the to see that they are

628
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:54,220
not just rooting for this is it face may

629
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:58,330
be isolated si Dakota direction I don't

630
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:02,040
know that the the solution stressing

631
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:04,690
from the PBS but there could they could

632
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,080
contain there are other kramitz

633
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:11,200
alpha channel mobile so example the

634
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:16,090
street the end in lotta let's cope also

635
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:20,009
PDF of solution but the safety is very

636
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:23,140
important to us because they are little

637
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:27,400
they are like all for Travis to appear

638
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:30,009
before so I think good this Rosa already

639
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:34,590
code and maybe I will talk about so that

640
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:34,590
the health of like after them meet you

641
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,780
understand you I couldn't share very

642
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,580
well so I think the last statement was

643
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,430
she'll talk to you after this meeting

644
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:48,460
directly yeah so that yeah that would be

645
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:51,250
good to do you can follow up on I think

646
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:52,960
she likes the idea and would so let's

647
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:55,120
cut this off here and you to talk after

648
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,210
the meeting yeah yeah I don't want me to

649
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,650
ask that EPA the word Korea for us yeah

650
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,540
are we okay with your dad good piece

651
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:03,540
let's talk after the meeting yeah

652
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:09,040
exactly thinks I had I have heard I'm

653
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:11,380
understanding hi

654
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,140
so Dave syncope again liaison managers

655
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:17,050
BBF if there are requirements I mean the

656
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:19,299
document was sent over in one of the

657
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,890
leaves on the latest relays on I would

658
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,329
encourage people to take a look at it

659
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,129
review

660
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:25,140
if there are requirements that need to

661
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:29,009
be covered or should people feel are

662
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,900
missing that process is still open in

663
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:34,589
the BBF

664
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:42,180
so feel free to approach them thank you

665
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:43,910
for a reasonable fee nothing nothing so

666
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:49,469
I should I should ignore them as usual

667
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:52,109
exactly ok please proceed thank you

668
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:54,180
thank you some things to go for bringing

669
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:56,788
go so the beans is actually a huge case

670
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:59,129
that we want to to showcase that we can

671
00:43:56,789 --> 00:44:03,690
support mobile blacks types and multiple

672
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:09,269
scenarios and so how many of you know

673
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:14,519
forces can I see a show of hands ok ok

674
00:44:09,269 --> 00:44:17,839
so I'll just do a very brief intro so

675
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:20,669
forces in ITF solution for some time ago

676
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,729
there are a couple of RFC's already

677
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:26,670
published we had two successful

678
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:30,359
interoperability tests and for this has

679
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:32,670
a number of features like availability

680
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:36,449
publish subscribes and request response

681
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,539
I think if the most important most

682
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:44,489
important is that the protocol is

683
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:48,150
independent of the model so Forces

684
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:49,890
models the the functions of the data

685
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:51,989
plane using what we what we call the

686
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,328
logical functional block so it's an

687
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:56,789
abstraction of the functions of the data

688
00:44:54,329 --> 00:45:00,690
plane the forces model is

689
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:02,150
object-oriented and has several

690
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,839
advantages of this like we have

691
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:08,479
inheritance we have augmentations and so

692
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,690
developer can define the components

693
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:15,749
capabilities and events of of a data

694
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:18,569
plane function and he can manipulated

695
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:20,939
and which the component and which

696
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:22,589
actually change the behavior of the can

697
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,170
change the behavior of the data buff

698
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:28,259
program and so packets come in on

699
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:31,789
optional metadata and they are being

700
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:34,170
altered by the data program possibly and

701
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:36,829
exit as

702
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:39,809
additional metadata or changed and

703
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:43,400
proceed to the next lfp class so we have

704
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:46,950
lfb classes that are instantiated and

705
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:50,130
connecting it into a graph which

706
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:53,669
actually creates creates a service so

707
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:58,559
why force it's an existing ietf solution

708
00:45:53,670 --> 00:46:02,309
it has been proven it has been used it

709
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:07,049
provides a data model that can support

710
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:09,989
it is extensible it allows you to define

711
00:46:07,049 --> 00:46:16,710
among other things capabilities hanging

712
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:19,380
friends lfb graphs can be dynamic so a

713
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,839
control plane application can actually

714
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,630
change the behavior or and change the

715
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,630
services that exists in the uniform

716
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:30,450
plane it can natively support any type

717
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:35,130
of access foreign will show and I will

718
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:38,098
showcase how and for any new lfb

719
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:40,470
including the into the into the foreign

720
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:43,349
plane does not have any impact on the

721
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:46,410
protocol right so we can add ends many

722
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:51,359
new existing or renewal fps and the

723
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:54,839
protocol is going to stay the same so as

724
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,180
I said before the we use the BNZ as as a

725
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:03,569
huge case and we took a look at the the

726
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:06,828
pppoe as an example so for example we

727
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:11,339
have a port Elif is that in have

728
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:16,279
incoming traffic and based on specific

729
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:19,680
values of ethyl type and P being control

730
00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:21,119
control field this may be need to be

731
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,519
sent to this will be needed to be sent

732
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,470
of the control plane to be handled by

733
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,288
some kind of tunneling infrastructures

734
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:31,680
which could be excellent or even for

735
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:34,049
supports a way to transport to him to

736
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,359
the control plane which will then be

737
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:39,650
sent back into the data plan to be sent

738
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:45,119
to the subscriber to the subscriber side

739
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:47,670
Hey so when has been authenticated and

740
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:51,850
authorized to use the

741
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:55,900
- to proceed to - the network then the

742
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:57,509
control plane is going to program the

743
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:00,160
classify in order to allow this

744
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:02,260
subscriber traffic to pass through it

745
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,680
goes through the classifier through the

746
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,740
people of B in order to end caps - to

747
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:11,740
capsulate the PPE pppoe hiddenness

748
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:14,259
IP very routing to discover the next

749
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:17,200
next hope and then goes out into the

750
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:19,570
network on the way back of course we

751
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,330
have a similar kind of graph of all of

752
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:25,900
this so it goes through an instance of

753
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:30,250
LF b class goes through the a classifier

754
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:32,710
LF being back - discovers that this is

755
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:35,500
for specific user has been subscribed

756
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:37,570
based on the destination IP address goes

757
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,850
to the IP v routing LF being goes to the

758
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:44,860
pppoe will be to be encapsulated in

759
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:49,020
pppoe packets out of the port LF in

760
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:52,930
towards the subscriber side right so

761
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:55,480
once traffic goes through the vb ng we

762
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:58,720
need to be able to to monitor traffic in

763
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:04,480
order to to find you know its autistics

764
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:06,939
and possibly usage usage measurements in

765
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,370
order to do accounting

766
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,740
there are a number of ways this can be

767
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:15,040
done via forces you could actually the

768
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:17,620
control plane could pole the front plane

769
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:21,850
and special for example the ppl if we

770
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:24,790
could hold stats or the controller could

771
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:28,620
the control plane could subscribe to

772
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:32,590
events for statistics so it can get

773
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:35,980
notifications for for statistics or even

774
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:39,400
better if when another solutions be to

775
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:43,000
to create a specific l FB for that for

776
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:46,090
monitoring right as we said before we

777
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,390
can sub for supports any kind of access

778
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:53,170
type and can do that by simply creating

779
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:56,560
different l FB classes that will be able

780
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:59,890
to handle the different kind of access

781
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,520
types right and this as I said before

782
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,770
has no

783
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:07,270
impact on the protocol protocol has

784
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:11,910
specific verbs said yet delete and it

785
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:15,180
may it is going it is it manipulates

786
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:17,980
components inside the the lfb class

787
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,899
whatever as long as it is model using

788
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:24,700
the first model the first protocol is

789
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:29,380
able to handle that so now that was a

790
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:31,509
brief view of simply connectivity

791
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:36,310
service so what happens if you want to

792
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:38,800
to have new new services into the so we

793
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:40,660
can simply add new LF B's into the graph

794
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,520
right for example for a bad news

795
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,220
bandwidth management service we can add

796
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,220
a policy lfb or can have a code

797
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:53,439
enforcement service and again this has

798
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:57,160
no impact at all for the protocol and

799
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:00,190
this is an example for so we can simply

800
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:03,460
add NLF being to the into an existing

801
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:05,160
graph and we can sync so that we can

802
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:09,660
have a bandwidth management service and

803
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:15,250
similarly for the for the down down

804
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:18,310
traffic right and we can even go one

805
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:21,940
step further and have specific services

806
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:24,160
for specific users and we can classify a

807
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:29,140
user based on some characteristic like

808
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:34,180
the type or whatever you know based on

809
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:37,870
IP address or MAC address and this one

810
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:41,109
if the classifier will select the next

811
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:43,509
LFP that's going to be a next graph of

812
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:46,960
LFP that the specific user is going to

813
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:50,620
be handled so you can have specific

814
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,530
services for specific users right and

815
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:58,120
for the for similarly for the for the

816
00:51:53,530 --> 00:52:03,270
downstream and upstream traffic right

817
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:06,250
and so again having a data model is

818
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:08,230
quite useful in order to be able to

819
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:12,070
support this kind of

820
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:13,680
kind of activities so that the protocol

821
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:16,230
is not going to be changed

822
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,060
it's not going to be changed by any

823
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:22,090
changes of new services or new function

824
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,080
that we want to do add yes thank you

825
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:25,930
guys a question

826
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:28,299
Louis change from Geneva yes to

827
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,220
standardize a protocol in between is a

828
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:33,850
very big challenge the reason why I say

829
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:35,890
that is if you look at so many radius

830
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:37,779
Archbold for each vendor it's over 100

831
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:39,100
radius attributes it means different

832
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,050
functions due to different hardware

833
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,569
implementations and you want to

834
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:45,970
standardize it how do you do it because

835
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:48,220
radius already you have four different

836
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:50,500
radius kind of attributes meaning

837
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:53,230
different implementations in different

838
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:56,230
vendors only a very small set of

839
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:59,280
standard attributed a in ITF for the

840
00:52:56,230 --> 00:53:02,290
radius sections all the rest is a VP or

841
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,600
special a special attributes vendor

842
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:06,130
passive a attributes VSA how it

843
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,259
standardizes right the second question

844
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:10,300
actually is you want to start at

845
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:13,300
something which is also difficult to see

846
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:16,450
is like a line cut we put I like a crash

847
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:18,730
instead of I mean dropping dousing of

848
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:20,618
user you still in send message one

849
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:22,690
message to the control plane how you

850
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:24,850
digest those messages standardize that

851
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:27,820
one is another problem for me I mean for

852
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:29,650
me to see a criticism okay so for the

853
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:31,570
for the first question you find the Sun

854
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:35,619
correctly you say how do you standardize

855
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:38,680
the connection to the radio server or a

856
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:41,619
signature because today radius is the

857
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,440
major one using right yes and already if

858
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:47,619
amanda has a very big dictionary VSA

859
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,109
which is very venta pacific kind of

860
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:52,030
things only a very small portion is

861
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:53,650
standardized right now you can't

862
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:55,810
standardized or distinguishing one

863
00:53:53,650 --> 00:54:00,119
protocol that means every Vantage's

864
00:53:55,810 --> 00:54:00,119
would use the same dictionary which is

865
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:04,710
you're talking about I think he's

866
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:08,430
talking about the control parties I

867
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:11,470
using Gradius that doesn't change I

868
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:17,680
don't even I can take it on school is an

869
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:19,540
ITF standard it's already upstairs you

870
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,848
need to translate all these kind of

871
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:22,950
radius and

872
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:25,819
chuckling doing the reporting plane and

873
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:28,828
that may happen when the Pacific things

874
00:54:25,819 --> 00:54:31,049
so there is no there is no data path to

875
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:35,609
control path for using radius radius is

876
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:38,700
a subscriber management that's right and

877
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:40,859
force in event enforce it in some way

878
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:43,319
right in the program that kind of things

879
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:45,900
into the folding plane and that one

880
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:47,759
actually you have to mean yes that it's

881
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,700
not so some church around out of this

882
00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:59,880
together okay so yeah I will let that

883
00:54:50,700 --> 00:55:02,308
pass okay Dan Bogdanovich so on the know

884
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:06,869
this okay first of all one other thing

885
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:11,400
which my brain is not completely fried

886
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:14,009
out having a fixed set of basic

887
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,569
primitives and then adding vendor

888
00:55:14,009 --> 00:55:19,920
extensions on top of it

889
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:21,869
makes in general the community life

890
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,690
easier because they're saying we have a

891
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:26,369
certain semantics and syntax that we can

892
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,819
all use and then we can do vendor

893
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:33,839
extensions on top of that on that part I

894
00:55:29,819 --> 00:55:36,269
you know I agree and Lewis said that you

895
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:37,619
know this thing with the radius is a

896
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:39,479
good example because there are a few

897
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:41,969
common ones and then many vendor

898
00:55:39,479 --> 00:55:45,538
specific ones that's a pretty good

899
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:47,489
approach and I personally like that

900
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:50,549
approach to be move forward there are

901
00:55:47,489 --> 00:55:52,469
two things what they have with the you

902
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:55,969
know with the forces I like the idea

903
00:55:52,469 --> 00:55:57,749
their question is is there a

904
00:55:55,969 --> 00:56:00,150
implementation because there are other

905
00:55:57,749 --> 00:56:03,328
frameworks like that where you can model

906
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:06,869
the data plane and put it into there are

907
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:10,799
much more used and if you could explain

908
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:13,440
why forces is better than the other

909
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:16,019
existing frameworks that are getting a

910
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,089
lot of traction within the industry then

911
00:56:16,019 --> 00:56:24,029
we can evaluate then we can evaluate

912
00:56:18,089 --> 00:56:26,788
that so I can you know I can mark I can

913
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:29,369
use cap and proto to model the data

914
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:31,950
plane in x-men and expose it up north

915
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:34,259
string so why should I care idea plenty

916
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,069
of other ones and I can say I could let

917
00:56:34,259 --> 00:56:37,710
me finish now

918
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:42,840
then he i'm asking him not asking you

919
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:44,700
this part so if you can say that

920
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,950
combination I mean no sir if you can do

921
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,480
the comparison why this versus the other

922
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:50,580
what are the benefits of using this

923
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,340
versus the others I'm happy with that do

924
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:55,620
consider it okay so this is a slide on

925
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:59,910
that right that's why you want to use

926
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:02,520
forces right so who's actually is so I

927
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:06,240
think we're gonna we're gonna let them

928
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:09,000
respond and then respond to the mic and

929
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:13,259
then we're gonna shut down the

930
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:21,420
discussion okay thanks for this is not

931
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:23,400
only you know a way to package things

932
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:28,010
together and send it to the other side

933
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:29,850
right so it's not only about doing

934
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:33,750
serialization deserialization

935
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:36,630
it has it's an architect right it has

936
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,400
the model it is the protocol the

937
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:43,890
protocol has already specific

938
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:47,990
capabilities like as we said high

939
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:47,990
availability event subscriptions

940
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:55,080
it is transport layer ignosi you can

941
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:56,879
have augmentations of models you can do

942
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,040
all these kind of things so it's not

943
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,050
about serialization deserialization

944
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:03,300
right so from what I understand for cap

945
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:05,850
and proto or any other civilization is a

946
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:09,480
laser you have to develop all these kind

947
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:12,660
of features from you have to actually

948
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:24,270
develop this right so this inherently

949
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:26,940
supports all this response except being

950
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:29,850
the ITF protocol the other things that

951
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,830
you're putting down here I mean I can

952
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:33,540
you know I can use the existing

953
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:42,240
frameworks that are already out there I

954
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:44,759
just mentioned one with you okay a

955
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,129
30-second rebuttal just a quick 30

956
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,080
seconds okay so they're not ITF

957
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:51,060
standards this is an idea of standard

958
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,560
it has been vetted here for many years

959
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,600
sure I couldn't go and implement your

960
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,340
own thing and you can get a hundred of

961
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,890
your friends to work on it this is a

962
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:00,360
standard it's been deployed it's well

963
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:04,140
understood it's got a lot of scrutiny

964
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:05,790
here the idea okay we we don't yeah we

965
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,310
don't need to continue the discussion

966
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:11,700
thanks a lot it was very

967
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:19,250
thought-provoking and timely so um so

968
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:19,250
next up we have Chun Fang Zhi presenting

969
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:38,040
yeah I would really appreciate if you

970
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:39,900
cut the marketing and keep on really

971
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:45,290
describing what's happening okay because

972
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:45,290
slides have marked in some degree okay

973
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:01,570
hello everyone my name is gia come from

974
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,540
of China Telecom

975
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:08,920
it's my priority to share some

976
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:15,190
experience about sf6 Department of some

977
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:18,869
several operators this draft is about us

978
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:21,880
obviously considerations actually it has

979
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:25,990
relationship with other what are the

980
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:27,670
traffic's the service diploma stators if

981
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:30,490
you teachers progressed this draft need

982
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:33,180
to use progress as a v6 industry

983
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:36,220
including deployments implementations

984
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:39,790
academic contributors and in operating

985
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:41,529
tests and those as you maybe you may be

986
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:45,009
you know that your said seven

987
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:47,710
deployments worldwide Softbank China

988
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:51,490
Telecom China Unicom and soon as a

989
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:54,150
cetera and then this in this a year

990
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:58,379
after were many introduced deployment

991
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:01,930
suggestions the provided some suggest to

992
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:06,160
some suggest about a network transition

993
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:13,118
and solutions to in some specific

994
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:16,680
scenarios we also need to use did hear

995
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:21,820
about his Paris of a visa deployment

996
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:25,480
well where the the earlier drafts gives

997
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:27,940
some diplomas theaters and the features

998
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:32,290
these features of the subject

999
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:35,500
deployments and we all know that as a TV

1000
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:38,619
sixty Berkeley Tunes past several years

1001
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:41,109
Nickelodeon channel and meter operator

1002
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:43,660
has deployed a pv6 relation wide so

1003
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:46,930
which gives strong foundations for us

1004
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:49,319
opposite Department we all know that as

1005
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:53,350
a v6 has the following advantage is that

1006
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:55,720
first is that a PVC throat application

1007
01:01:53,350 --> 01:02:00,310
this is compared with the

1008
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:05,439
amperes as our MPs because yes amperes

1009
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:07,930
if you adopt 32 Pete's segment which

1010
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,250
will be at the vet has across all the

1011
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:18,529
dominant work but in

1012
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:21,200
yes a v6 because it it in use the native

1013
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:25,960
ipv6 features so the road can be

1014
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:29,810
aggregated to reduce the issue of the

1015
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:32,840
routing issues skeptical of any issues

1016
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:36,349
so we also can say that as a basic

1017
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:39,980
provide end-to-end auto end to end

1018
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:44,660
service auto start which means service

1019
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:47,510
agility because because well as I'm

1020
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:51,920
curious I need to upgrade other node to

1021
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:55,520
support support capability but yes a v6

1022
01:02:51,920 --> 01:03:02,560
we only need to have be deployed based

1023
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:04,790
on actual requirements of the operators

1024
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:07,670
we all know that a services can be

1025
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:10,670
untrue on demand upgrade which reduce

1026
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:15,349
service proven in hand and so we can

1027
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:17,570
status of several advantages this draft

1028
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:20,240
also gives some deployment academy

1029
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:23,599
guidance for a service deployment we

1030
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:26,750
also have two options for this network

1031
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:32,720
transition the first one is from IBM

1032
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:37,630
ps/2 ipv6 then as a v6 and as a second

1033
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:41,959
one is from IP and ps2 SMPS and 12 is 6

1034
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:45,500
so from our experience we think that the

1035
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:47,750
first one may be more natural and 3

1036
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:50,770
forward so will you come back so right

1037
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:54,099
now will you comment the option option 1

1038
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:58,670
it is it is very simple that you should

1039
01:03:54,099 --> 01:04:01,580
make also network to be ipv6 capable as

1040
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:04,700
what we have done in right now so then

1041
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:08,330
secondly we need to upgrade the some at

1042
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:11,118
routers some edge device to be a service

1043
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:17,180
keepo based on the actual demand of the

1044
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:20,900
service then next we upgrade the network

1045
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:23,740
to either immediately know some of the

1046
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:26,829
media to know to support

1047
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:30,368
to support ipv6 to support as a basics

1048
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:34,329
to meet to enable traffic engineering

1049
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:38,140
except a dinner and as a SFC etc the

1050
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:45,240
next week we hope we all plan to upgrade

1051
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:49,299
all Network to P and to end as a v6 so

1052
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:52,839
as as week six we this case has been

1053
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:55,540
mentioned several times just as a bit

1054
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:58,089
Mystics the Internet the field trial in

1055
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:01,270
China Telecom actually is Institute on

1056
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:07,690
province this strong-severe big province

1057
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:12,520
is similar to the size of Germany so in

1058
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:14,890
this case this case we depend on the

1059
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:18,130
architecture of the whole network in

1060
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:21,250
China telecom we have two backbones IP

1061
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:25,569
backbones one is one six three which is

1062
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:28,990
a lady IP network of course it is ipv4

1063
01:05:25,569 --> 01:05:32,380
and ipv6 to stack which provide many

1064
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:37,720
internet access service and a DC service

1065
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:42,730
and also and also some mobile Internet

1066
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:44,700
services etc and another the other

1067
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:47,760
backbone is seemed to which provide

1068
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:49,960
which which is unpierced based

1069
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:54,369
8-minute provides some kinds of to

1070
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:59,319
improvise users so in a traditional

1071
01:05:54,369 --> 01:06:01,690
approach maybe this is the traditional

1072
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:05,740
approach the Enterprise Service carries

1073
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:07,630
into but differently in this case the

1074
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:10,899
video traffic for for the

1075
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:14,970
interconnection with the video platform

1076
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:19,089
the connection is carried in 1 6 3

1077
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:21,189
because 1 6 3 provide abundant bandwidth

1078
01:06:19,089 --> 01:06:24,630
but which can meet the requirements of

1079
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:27,760
the video video service so in order to

1080
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:29,049
the process of is quickly with the way

1081
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,619
implement

1082
01:06:29,049 --> 01:06:35,380
P routers to be activist to be SR basics

1083
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:36,820
people so we can provide service quickly

1084
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:40,330
in Shoreham

1085
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:43,240
which improves the service service of

1086
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:47,430
Romanians providers improve the speed of

1087
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:51,160
a service bell ringing the second

1088
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:55,660
prominent case is China Unicom the

1089
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:59,560
backbone of charity comes is 1 6 9 is

1090
01:06:55,660 --> 01:07:03,549
once called 169 actually is a number in

1091
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:07,690
this case it many years as a basic has

1092
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:09,400
been adopted 240 the collection of cloud

1093
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:14,230
Deepika's centers it collects data

1094
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:17,170
center actually is similar to to tell it

1095
01:07:14,230 --> 01:07:21,760
had come to some extent so in this case

1096
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:24,970
because China tan the backbone Network

1097
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:29,110
has PPP's rider over the country if

1098
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:34,660
loading the metal in the work so we has

1099
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:37,360
we have some end-to-end ipv6 foundation

1100
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:43,509
at work for a service department so in

1101
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:47,500
this case we deploy PE equipment to make

1102
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:51,910
a temple as a basis for the deployment

1103
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:54,400
and any question yeah real quick

1104
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:57,600
question this is Dino

1105
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:01,750
can you put values to smoothly and quick

1106
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:03,700
sorry you said that smoothly migrates

1107
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:06,010
can you put some data behind us so we

1108
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:07,890
can judge what's smooth and what's not

1109
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:11,620
smooth and how quick you switched over

1110
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:13,900
me the switch over medication when the

1111
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:16,450
one in the last slide wins 163 went down

1112
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:21,970
how long did it take you to get to the

1113
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:25,269
other one in this speed right in time in

1114
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:27,790
half no seconds seconds hundreds of

1115
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:30,990
milliseconds it's not a second actually

1116
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:33,609
because this is the service for

1117
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:35,769
enterprise users a traditional would

1118
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:38,320
maybe take more than one months because

1119
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:40,150
we need to enter some kind of procedure

1120
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:43,210
it's a long time but now maybe several

1121
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:44,979
days this service can be prevented to

1122
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:46,450
customer is this is not for ordinary

1123
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:48,279
users ok

1124
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:49,649
did you do any measurements on the

1125
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:57,479
switch over time

1126
01:08:49,649 --> 01:08:59,009
uh-uh not yet okay okay hi Tony Lee it

1127
01:08:57,479 --> 01:09:00,990
seems like most of what you're doing

1128
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:04,140
here is all just VPN stuff is there a

1129
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:08,130
beacon of any actual te going on here it

1130
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:11,730
has not been T maybe agenda has not been

1131
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:15,150
done yet okay so you could be doing this

1132
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:19,709
with something much simpler than s rv6

1133
01:09:15,149 --> 01:09:22,559
yes yes and maybe you feel Joe okay so

1134
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:23,580
then how much bandwidth did you waste to

1135
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,390
get this VPNs

1136
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:30,210
uh how much band awaits me right

1137
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:32,840
you tell you Telecom the service the

1138
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:37,200
Panda is service range from chicopee's

1139
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:42,000
teepees to ten catering gig so it's a

1140
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:44,910
large range of other bandwidth you seems

1141
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,250
like you could have been doing this with

1142
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:47,870
a much simpler lower bandwidth VPN

1143
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,910
solution

1144
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:55,710
did you compute how much extra bandwidth

1145
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:57,630
this is taking this Adobe Tony I

1146
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:59,820
understand Anna so I think that the

1147
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:02,730
benefit the icing is playing here is

1148
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:04,290
across a mass matomoto me yeah because

1149
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:06,690
you're not here this so you've mentioned

1150
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:10,580
that there's a backbone use the IP the

1151
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:15,059
pure IP so that's the difficulty for VPN

1152
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:17,570
you can run Jeremy for across domains

1153
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:27,420
just fine today

1154
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:32,219
okay Tony so we often like so also in

1155
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:35,310
China Unicom set up the key equipment to

1156
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:37,350
be a savvy skip post so that between

1157
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:39,420
traffic can be traversed from one

1158
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:41,730
ottoman system to another which means

1159
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:45,290
from before example from Beijing to hong

1160
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:48,389
kong province and also we all know that

1161
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:52,080
the new province has also implemented as

1162
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:56,660
a basic space VPN service in in

1163
01:10:52,080 --> 01:11:01,200
guangzhou shinden and Bloomquist it is

1164
01:10:56,660 --> 01:11:01,950
so please our experience as a v6 has

1165
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,530
shown

1166
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:07,420
showing advantage

1167
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:12,200
internal service agility and incremental

1168
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:15,620
migration so we think that a service is

1169
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:17,929
very attractive and well variable for

1170
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:20,750
the future network the prominent of

1171
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:26,020
course it needs more multi prominent

1172
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:29,960
cases for for the further evaluation and

1173
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:32,450
maybe we need to for the maturity of the

1174
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:35,630
network in the future it can also be

1175
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:40,970
used for favortie transport and the

1176
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:42,860
people signals etc so we hope that the

1177
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:48,080
pace are more experienced more import

1178
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:51,440
will be provided for such as previous

1179
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:56,059
address a service locator and hobbies si

1180
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:58,419
be design policy is et cetera so we

1181
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:05,180
welcome any more feedbacks and

1182
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:10,970
corporations in the future thank you

1183
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:13,190
that's a real quick question how many SR

1184
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:16,850
v6 hops do you anticipate you would

1185
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:18,889
deploy you need us as a v6 yeah let me

1186
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:20,290
see okay actually SIDS would be in the

1187
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:25,310
SSR each other

1188
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:27,380
si sorry how many hops in the source

1189
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:30,710
route you anticipate with the network

1190
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:33,710
deployment Tino answer this question so

1191
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:36,200
under in fact now that's a user only the

1192
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:39,080
air to note there are some no SRH or not

1193
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:41,929
yeah because the VPN for the VP and they

1194
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:45,559
also know as I know si we will think

1195
01:12:41,930 --> 01:12:47,770
about this as loose loose key guys you

1196
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:50,270
the question just in general yeah yeah

1197
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:52,370
what do you how many hops do you think

1198
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:54,830
would be yeah I think that is the

1199
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:57,500
backbone we think about there so you the

1200
01:12:54,830 --> 01:13:03,800
five two oh six another maximum or maybe

1201
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:07,880
ten Hut did you say three zero so the 30

1202
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:11,150
hops in the SRH times 16 bytes are you

1203
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:18,160
gonna give your user any data Wow a 160

1204
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:18,160
bias huh 106 bias 106 and 710 segment

1205
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:25,070
David I found say ICT Kenya super Banga

1206
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:30,349
to this light with the incremental

1207
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:33,290
deployment yeah this one in is that one

1208
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:36,200
isn't from your site to our career to

1209
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:40,190
ipv6 and to my stand at my on the

1210
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:45,590
Trenton they operate from ipv4 to ipv6

1211
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:48,169
maybe from the corner was first and your

1212
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:52,100
step two is a bhagavate to the edge

1213
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:55,610
device first so and microwaves it will

1214
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:59,990
charge up day today I will be forth from

1215
01:13:55,610 --> 01:14:02,480
the core network and in the wizard Eddie

1216
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:06,200
Network and kills day in the eye before

1217
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:10,879
before then Bozzio consideration for

1218
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:15,440
this application scenarios my

1219
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:18,650
understanding is that that each in our

1220
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:21,980
case because ipv6 has been realized

1221
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:24,080
everywhere a PVC has been capable has

1222
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:27,160
been variety I refer to network so we

1223
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:32,960
things that maybe this transition from

1224
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:36,590
ipv6 and ipv6 we appear will be better

1225
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:40,280
choice then as our MPs but maybe it was

1226
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:43,360
other maybe for other operators we may

1227
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:45,860
have a real specific

1228
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:49,580
suppose we requirements for network

1229
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:51,910
equipment maybe as ice army MPs will be

1230
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:54,950
a bad choice as Mohonasen

1231
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:58,040
thank you basically yes maybe you know

1232
01:14:54,950 --> 01:15:01,340
some application servers we updated the

1233
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:03,560
eight divided fort and then and added to

1234
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:07,490
the other applications innovate maybe we

1235
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:09,560
updated the core devices first yeah yeah

1236
01:15:07,490 --> 01:15:12,110
thank you so depending on actual

1237
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:13,580
scenario on here remain Rick's Nokia

1238
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:16,250
can you go back to the slide where you

1239
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:17,450
do the comparison on the yeah I think

1240
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:20,060
here you are

1241
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:22,790
I your comparison native MPLS but there

1242
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:25,240
is also implementations where you do

1243
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:28,190
segment routing and peláez over over IP

1244
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:30,990
and if you would take this comparison

1245
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:33,360
into account all your things are

1246
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:35,730
chillie not true what is here so you're

1247
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,860
you're comparing just I wanting from the

1248
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:41,969
other but there is other ways to achieve

1249
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:44,790
that in which case this this analysis is

1250
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:46,410
not honest and up-to-date with all the

1251
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:50,880
capabilities which we have available in

1252
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:54,330
the idea okay actually this this is not

1253
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:57,360
actually power absolute comparison of

1254
01:15:54,330 --> 01:16:00,059
true technology I think maybe in some

1255
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:04,110
cases as amperes wave has its advantage

1256
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:06,450
over a B 6 so this depend as I haven't

1257
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:10,230
mentioned as is depend are the depend on

1258
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:12,720
the actual use case I just want to point

1259
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:15,990
out that I you're confusing people who

1260
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:18,120
are reading this yes maybe I think if

1261
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:20,519
you want to document how you are

1262
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:23,070
migrating to as or v6 mmm-hmm

1263
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:25,110
I think it that's that's okay to do but

1264
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:27,150
I think just make sure that you don't

1265
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:29,639
that you compare the full spectrum if

1266
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:33,980
you do a comparison okay okay thank you

1267
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:36,930
we miss some other adjustment just meant

1268
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:38,959
so true from Softbank thank you for

1269
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:43,050
sharing are you experienced a deployment

1270
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:46,620
in detail I just make some coin comment

1271
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:48,960
um I'm really happy to see you're

1272
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:52,410
talking about deployment not only a

1273
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:55,110
Greenfield so many people claim that hey

1274
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:59,280
it's our basic require Rudy Greenfield

1275
01:16:55,110 --> 01:17:02,070
different case but the you show a good

1276
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:04,769
example that that s our basic doesn't

1277
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:09,059
require Greenfield to be deployed and

1278
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:12,750
also if you have some chance to

1279
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:16,980
introduce te future I saw this some

1280
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:20,670
discussion here but if you consider that

1281
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:24,740
some controllin technotrekker flex argue

1282
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:28,830
or something to obstruct as intent

1283
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:31,440
topology or path so it would be a good

1284
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:34,530
idea to reduce the size of the seat and

1285
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:37,200
site the number of seat in the pocket I

1286
01:17:34,530 --> 01:17:40,380
think you can still keep the one seat in

1287
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:43,349
just our pp6 distinction address in the

1288
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:45,390
ipv6 header that would be fine to do the

1289
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:48,660
traffic engine future

1290
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:50,820
even for the inter-domain case if the if

1291
01:17:48,660 --> 01:18:00,120
inter-domain flex I'll go is possible

1292
01:17:50,820 --> 01:18:01,759
thank yes like so this yes this it

1293
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:06,390
depending on the progress of the

1294
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:10,410
compressed compressed the as a basic

1295
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:11,330
standard okay so I'm compressing up a

1296
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:14,430
little bit

1297
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:17,760
scare me that when we mentioned that a

1298
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:20,340
compress it discussion you know so did

1299
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:23,750
not to reduce I hate that self but put

1300
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:28,440
the multiple semantics in just one

1301
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:34,680
128-bit field that'll be my my point

1302
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:40,019
thank you okay well thanks a lot thank

1303
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:41,490
you so thanks and all deployment cases

1304
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:43,860
are very useful please keep on bringing

1305
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:48,389
in and personally I would be really

1306
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:50,700
interested to see migration from T based

1307
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:53,100
networks or CPT where for example

1308
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:57,300
iterations done in Burns versus moving

1309
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:59,250
to computations done of and how people

1310
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,140
solve problems with regards to bend with

1311
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:03,090
resource reservation and stuff to be

1312
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:13,610
really interesting use cases to discuss

1313
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:13,610
here yeah so next up is why mo Chen

1314
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:25,530
hello everyone I'm climate change from

1315
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:28,980
shoot away today I'm going to talk about

1316
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:30,410
a SRT pass meter meter point of us

1317
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:34,200
protection

1318
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:38,450
so first let's give an overview so we

1319
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:42,690
have existing faster for me to point

1320
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:47,070
however we meet a point of a surpass

1321
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:51,629
fails the traffic where we are lost for

1322
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:56,059
some time even though the existing fr4

1323
01:19:51,630 --> 01:20:00,570
midpoint is used so our solution is

1324
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:04,320
provide a protection for that clear of a

1325
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:07,559
time that means that with our solution

1326
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:11,870
the failure of a meter point of a

1327
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:16,200
surplus will be fully protected so here

1328
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:21,240
in this figure we give an example for

1329
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:24,420
example we have a path from node B to

1330
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,490
notice C so we'll go through node N and

1331
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:31,200
an oversea

1332
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:36,389
so when naught else fails so not P will

1333
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:40,309
provide facet protections however when I

1334
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:45,960
DP converges the traffic will get lost

1335
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:50,460
because after IGP converges know the B

1336
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:53,420
will not have rows to not n so for the

1337
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:56,630
traffic goes rule event will not see

1338
01:20:53,420 --> 01:21:00,750
those traffic work were dropped

1339
01:20:56,630 --> 01:21:03,000
only after another new class new and n

1340
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:05,640
to n the path from V to C is installed

1341
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,810
on the B and then traffic is recovered

1342
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:13,530
so we can see that the traffic get lost

1343
01:21:09,810 --> 01:21:17,310
from the point at which the edge we

1344
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:20,790
convert converges on Q the new and the

1345
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:23,160
trend path is the installed so for that

1346
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:25,769
for those period of time which marked by

1347
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,930
the red red line that during that period

1348
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:31,550
time the traffic get lost so our

1349
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:34,470
solution is provide faster protections

1350
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:37,010
against the midpoint of failures

1351
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:39,960
that fear time so with our protection

1352
01:21:37,010 --> 01:21:48,330
the full layer of a be the point is

1353
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:51,930
fully protected so basically we revision

1354
01:21:48,330 --> 01:21:54,870
of several versions so operates to the

1355
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:57,780
previous versions that we changed the

1356
01:21:54,870 --> 01:22:01,019
title as a suggested so originally we

1357
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:06,090
use a segment routing proxy forwarding

1358
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:08,730
so right now we use a srt past mutable

1359
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:10,140
inner protection so this is more is

1360
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:13,500
better than the previous one

1361
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:19,710
in addition to that so originally we use

1362
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:24,360
a router capability trv to distribute

1363
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:28,020
the capabilities for proxy forwarding so

1364
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:31,049
we change that one to router functional

1365
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:32,790
capability of ease so this one I think

1366
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:35,930
this one is much better than previous

1367
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:40,220
one so in addition to that we either

1368
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:42,990
sections security considerations and Ana

1369
01:22:40,220 --> 01:22:49,370
considerations and then some r84 were

1370
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:53,429
changes so any comments and suggestions

1371
01:22:49,370 --> 01:22:55,380
do is change from a Juniper I do foresee

1372
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:57,750
that actually is a good thing to have a

1373
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:59,970
peer out for these operations but

1374
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:02,640
there's a issue actually I'm not sure

1375
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:05,640
with the diagram is a it's a very simple

1376
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:08,010
one it's be possible this because I GP

1377
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:10,410
the synchronization kind of timing

1378
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:13,350
sequence it would possible

1379
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:15,300
there's some kind of our drops actually

1380
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:17,670
deterring the switching so even your

1381
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:19,020
pilau you still have trouble of the one

1382
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:20,790
we say Michael your problem

1383
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,740
Michael looping avoidance problem

1384
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:24,360
actually it's another little I can tell

1385
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:28,620
you actually offline but this is

1386
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:31,769
possible it looks like the the issue you

1387
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:33,830
mentioned that is invisible because this

1388
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:39,060
one is we can see just look this example

1389
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:43,240
so when motor and fares then dr. P will

1390
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:46,090
provide fast protections and then

1391
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:49,860
as you become verges whatever converges

1392
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:53,080
so we can focus on the the motor be

1393
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:55,269
correct I am saying actually when I GB

1394
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:57,309
progress there were a different update

1395
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:59,410
of the stage and due to synchronization

1396
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:01,570
of the control plane and synchronizing

1397
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:03,550
of the after 14 play and control playing

1398
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:05,910
there will be a little bit easier there

1399
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:10,960
I will show you later on actually the

1400
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:14,980
minimum is a minimum I see maybe you

1401
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:17,260
have some very tiny you I'm saying

1402
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:20,830
actually there will be possible packet

1403
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:22,780
loss during that time but still you have

1404
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:25,059
a possible pick a loss doing something

1405
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:30,190
like a libecki loop avoidance problem

1406
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:32,830
yeah that's a the IDP you think for some

1407
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:35,740
period of time but the other one here is

1408
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:38,830
our focus is at this big appear of time

1409
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:41,050
so that my mind of - my know my cordoba

1410
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:45,790
may be there because that's a IDP do you

1411
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:47,860
think for sake of time I gotta Martin

1412
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:50,320
Horn of Hanoi - Telecom have you

1413
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:52,420
considered that in many cases just using

1414
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,940
any cars groups for the mid points might

1415
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:58,840
solve the problem as well maybe even

1416
01:24:54,940 --> 01:25:00,460
faster yeah for any cars I think there

1417
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:07,900
are some issues I think we concede that

1418
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:13,020
those are a because the solutions what

1419
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:13,019
are the big issues with anycast yeah

1420
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:20,200
Martin depending on your network design

1421
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:23,559
you come to race use any caste how do

1422
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:25,900
you place your any caste it's on some

1423
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:29,290
networks oh yes it is doable but not

1424
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:32,530
always I think well I said it may be

1425
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:34,600
useful or feasible for many cases I'm

1426
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:39,250
not saying it solves all the cases okay

1427
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:42,490
yeah I think for us use any caste is the

1428
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:46,150
one solution even for us that cup of

1429
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:48,490
issues and for me the pointer yes I

1430
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:52,509
think maybe use a man any caste maybe

1431
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:54,340
maybe it's hot Stephanie kievsky can't

1432
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:57,310
you just try to solve it

1433
01:25:54,340 --> 01:26:02,110
by just delaying the duration of your

1434
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:05,680
ILM no this another party lane yeah

1435
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:09,759
these are the in the sense that if if P

1436
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:13,480
and B are just delayed delaying the

1437
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:15,700
deletion of the ILM to M no no this is

1438
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:21,700
not delayed so details detail solution

1439
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:25,090
act this way so no te we are distributed

1440
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:27,160
is capability for proxy for no no no I'm

1441
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:29,260
not talking about your solution I'm

1442
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:33,970
talking about something else which is

1443
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:37,690
just P and B are all seeing that n is

1444
01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:40,210
disappearing from the LSD be just keep

1445
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:48,969
the I am programmed is the following for

1446
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:52,030
couple of seconds a question you say Oh

1447
01:26:48,970 --> 01:26:55,510
question you just try to keep your

1448
01:26:52,030 --> 01:26:58,599
forwarding Entry Program in viata where

1449
01:26:55,510 --> 01:27:02,860
no no this is not not keep it

1450
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:04,780
traditional IP for the injuries not one

1451
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:08,830
so I think there's a miscommunication

1452
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:10,360
here what Stefan is asking is he

1453
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:14,970
understands what the solution you're

1454
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:18,130
proposing he's asking why not instead

1455
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:23,230
use a solution a different solution that

1456
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:26,530
delays the installation of basically of

1457
01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:28,450
the black hole or of the black hole in

1458
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:31,179
the traffic when you have no no entry

1459
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:38,139
basically keep keep the old notes it

1460
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:40,720
entry so the final solution or proposal

1461
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:43,600
is that which is keeping the older IP

1462
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:46,840
forwarding right not IP forwarding MPLS

1463
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:49,930
forwarding not IP you can delete IP but

1464
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:53,290
you need to keep em because we solved

1465
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:57,490
this kind of issues in LDPE conversions

1466
01:27:53,290 --> 01:28:00,640
with just delaying the labor with drawn

1467
01:27:57,490 --> 01:28:02,469
or label drop in G for warming yeah

1468
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:04,840
that's the that's what our solution

1469
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:06,670
that's a lot of a proposal here so these

1470
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,280
are one basically no no because you are

1471
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,990
old

1472
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:13,040
so advertising a lot of stuff but you

1473
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:15,849
you can just keep forwarding and just

1474
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:18,560
hop control brain I go to you because

1475
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:23,900
the idea is that we want to keep a

1476
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:26,060
daughter forwarding for s ID but how we

1477
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:30,019
achieve that so we need to have some

1478
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:33,230
ways to make some notes no or keep it

1479
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:35,450
either for the injury for me for some

1480
01:28:33,230 --> 01:28:37,730
time I'm not sure that you need to keep

1481
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:39,559
a control plane you can just keep the

1482
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:41,209
forwarding without any con Givens

1483
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:43,610
already the key we won't keep a

1484
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:45,410
forwarding plane we need a nice those

1485
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:47,809
people know that those are knows know

1486
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:56,330
keep a forwarding injury for me for some

1487
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:58,190
time right that's true it so this this

1488
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:59,600
is an incredibly common scenario us

1489
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:02,120
protection like this is what you're

1490
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,700
trying to do I'm still puzzled as to why

1491
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:06,800
there isn't a more elegant solution

1492
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:08,720
involving any casts so in that

1493
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,760
particular scenario presumably you

1494
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:14,300
should use in any car seat the N in

1495
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:17,600
which case ordinary fast reroute would

1496
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:22,760
sort the whole problem out no ordinary

1497
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:25,730
so digital on let me explain it then

1498
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:26,740
right so he discovers that it can't get

1499
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:31,459
to any anymore

1500
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:34,820
alright so P is going to does a a fast

1501
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:37,220
reroute to n prime which is well that

1502
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:40,580
ends anycast address which should get it

1503
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:43,130
to end in one once it's in 1 it will go

1504
01:29:40,580 --> 01:29:44,390
to C because that's the next sit so I

1505
01:29:43,130 --> 01:29:46,760
would have thought you could have built

1506
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:49,520
an anycast solution for this standard

1507
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:53,090
very common scenario and it would have

1508
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:55,510
just worked so I think I owe you for you

1509
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:58,880
I have a summer solution using any cast

1510
01:29:55,510 --> 01:30:01,340
so any other legacy will you propose

1511
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:04,040
details and then we can use causal user

1512
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:05,690
overlying or unreleased yeah so I

1513
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,519
certainly this is Dino I certainly

1514
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:10,339
support the idea and there's a lot of

1515
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:13,310
reasons why because if the CID is an

1516
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:15,560
anycast address and you have to reroute

1517
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:18,260
the headend doesn't have to change the

1518
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:20,240
SRH this is very useful and if you're

1519
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:21,110
always routing to end the any cast

1520
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:23,480
address and you

1521
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:25,219
the route to the top and you never have

1522
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:27,110
to delete anything from the FIB or any

1523
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:33,739
forwarding table because M will just

1524
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:38,420
stay there the next hop just changes why

1525
01:30:33,739 --> 01:30:41,299
is that any custom they have and also I

1526
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:43,969
think we have some users Abby I'll show

1527
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:49,250
you I think you you Robert even say R we

1528
01:30:43,969 --> 01:30:50,780
can discuss the other concern I've got

1529
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:52,670
and it's a concern I've always got with

1530
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:54,800
these sorts of solutions is that we

1531
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:56,929
reduce it to a sort of trivial cartoon

1532
01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:00,500
case when you apply this to a real

1533
01:30:56,929 --> 01:31:03,290
network with multiple hops in there then

1534
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:05,389
it very quickly breaks down but if you

1535
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:07,580
were if you could anycast to the two

1536
01:31:05,389 --> 01:31:09,650
exits then ordinary fast reroute

1537
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:11,869
followed by ordinary conversions would

1538
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:15,739
mean you could deal with any failure in

1539
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:18,710
getting from a to the a serial yes zero

1540
01:31:15,739 --> 01:31:21,320
or we have some users there because we

1541
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:24,310
already have pictures or figures to show

1542
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:27,530
those issues so if you have time many of

1543
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:36,679
the issues it would be useful if people

1544
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:39,290
could here with the issues so I think

1545
01:31:36,679 --> 01:31:42,830
you guys promote the soldiers give these

1546
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:45,050
are solutions for any hasn't had the

1547
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:48,800
issues with any cards been stated on the

1548
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:50,330
list yeah have they been stated you

1549
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,989
gotta just kinda first edition I'll find

1550
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:57,530
the argument so those are issues for

1551
01:31:53,989 --> 01:32:00,530
egress protection use any cast I send

1552
01:31:57,530 --> 01:32:03,739
the issues on the beast RTG of apology

1553
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:06,170
and a sprint we won last night which

1554
01:32:03,739 --> 01:32:07,519
basically said there are issues I'd like

1555
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:09,590
to know what the actual issue is

1556
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:12,170
yeah those are already ours and I think

1557
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:13,750
last night yeah the one that last night

1558
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:15,980
just said there are issues he didn't say

1559
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:20,060
specifically what the failure case is

1560
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:24,459
well actually I don't mean to defend

1561
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:24,460
this but what is a I wrote a loop but

1562
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:29,299
there isn't any case it not so this

1563
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:32,690
change that eternal from Siena

1564
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:34,790
before an Manan and you need banana

1565
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:35,120
casts to go to see if you are going to

1566
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:38,000
do

1567
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:39,980
you have another and and two an advocate

1568
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,660
for that basically where you go will

1569
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:47,089
change the hominin because you will need

1570
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:49,360
just will not scale so you see the

1571
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:51,890
working group is clearly demanding

1572
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:54,259
comparisons between any tacit feature

1573
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:56,390
proposal and the best way to address it

1574
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:59,240
is to dress in the draft not sending

1575
01:32:56,390 --> 01:33:01,430
emails to mailing lists please have

1576
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:03,320
comparison section Ares where you

1577
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:12,290
compare what working group is proposing

1578
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:13,929
versus what you're proposing with Peter

1579
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:16,880
yeah I'm still allowed to make a comment

1580
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:20,030
so just for the any cards maybe I just

1581
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,470
discussed with Stuart so the anycast

1582
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:24,440
would work which we are doing egress

1583
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:26,960
protection but we are what zebu is

1584
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:30,200
trying to do is trying to protect the

1585
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,300
city in the middle of the that the city

1586
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:34,700
which is the middle of the SRT stack

1587
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:36,890
right so it can be like a P note it is

1588
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:38,990
in the stack now that fails it's not the

1589
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:41,210
egress known anymore so that's why you

1590
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:42,860
can't have like why would you do any

1591
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:46,340
cards every note would have in any cards

1592
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:51,610
with some I don't know well with a

1593
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:51,610
thousand nodes in the network yes but

1594
01:33:51,790 --> 01:34:01,720
yeah but then you would have to have

1595
01:33:53,990 --> 01:34:03,889
thousand anycast addresses as well okay

1596
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:05,030
if you don't want to design a good

1597
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:07,370
network we could do it here if you want

1598
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:09,710
you know the thing is is if you're using

1599
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:12,080
ipv6 and you have link local you don't

1600
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:14,450
need unique global addresses so use link

1601
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:17,300
local addresses to realize your IGP and

1602
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:19,639
then all the addresses have unicast at

1603
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:22,420
each hierarchy so I have one comment

1604
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:25,250
here so there is an alternate proposal

1605
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:27,770
in spring working group for node

1606
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:30,830
protection for SRT paths that talks

1607
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:33,530
about the any cost to solution as well

1608
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:37,100
as the keeping the forwarding plane for

1609
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:39,530
a longer time the the proposal that

1610
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:42,290
stiffened talked about is explained in

1611
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:45,019
the draft I would request I do want to

1612
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:46,760
take a look thank you yes thank you we

1613
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:48,390
can look in that nobody know that those

1614
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:50,850
drafts yeah Louis

1615
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:53,220
juniper I I did I think you need both

1616
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:56,070
solutions in any cars and on any cars

1617
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:59,250
because recently if if any cast is no

1618
01:34:56,070 --> 01:35:05,759
longer T anymore not he actually no job

1619
01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:08,370
engineering so acceleration here first

1620
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:10,110
we need to decide with link working

1621
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:12,000
group chairs where we do this work

1622
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:14,370
because it's partially belong here

1623
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,860
because the first year out partially in

1624
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:19,440
spring because seventh routing and then

1625
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:22,019
potentially we should be able to

1626
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:25,230
conversion solutions and decide whether

1627
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:29,940
we need both or we agree on something

1628
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:31,230
that addressing everything and so to

1629
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:33,660
your next command for the largest

1630
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:36,419
reduction we do need to discuss with

1631
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:45,990
spring working group what we do and

1632
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:48,650
where the swap purpose thank you next up

1633
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,650
is Peru

1634
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:18,700
I'm here to give an update of this ITF

1635
01:36:14,650 --> 01:36:25,809
up young model on behalf of the other

1636
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:32,920
authors here is this app Yamato cover

1637
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:37,390
because the existing ITF i IP model just

1638
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:42,760
covers the basic enable like basic

1639
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:45,990
aesthetic neighbor mac entry but this

1640
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:50,640
app model covers more bits of up

1641
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:55,750
implementation like a proxy up or

1642
01:36:50,640 --> 01:37:02,410
brushes up and we add more like up

1643
01:36:55,750 --> 01:37:09,480
statistics and here is the current up up

1644
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:16,210
tree and and here is the changes since

1645
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:18,459
like ITF 104 and we just add more at

1646
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:22,450
Atari in province to the young modules

1647
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:25,660
and security sections and also based on

1648
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:28,269
one or for discussion we removed up

1649
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:32,860
specific this community timestamp

1650
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:35,230
editing the dr2 version and so but we

1651
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:40,059
added description to refer to the

1652
01:37:35,230 --> 01:37:42,940
interface one and we added processing up

1653
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:45,910
and crushes up example and we also

1654
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:50,879
removed up dynamic learning example

1655
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:57,400
because that was quite obvious one and

1656
01:37:50,880 --> 01:38:01,030
so this is all the changes and and we

1657
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:04,809
think that we already solved all the

1658
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:08,040
remaining issues so we we think that the

1659
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:11,470
next step is that we services it more

1660
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:14,890
comments on this draft and also waiting

1661
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:16,750
further working group last call Jeff

1662
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:19,990
house I've read multiple versions of

1663
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:20,770
this draft we are doing a study squirrel

1664
01:38:19,990 --> 01:38:22,750
through

1665
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:24,400
simply addressing small issues I would

1666
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:25,900
like to suggest to the chairs that this

1667
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,420
was ready to go probably three versions

1668
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:29,889
ago and that a working group last call

1669
01:38:28,420 --> 01:38:39,220
would probably push these to completion

1670
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:42,190
a lot faster Himanshu from CN I'd have a

1671
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:44,920
quick clarification question is static

1672
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:48,190
are covered in the base IP interface job

1673
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:52,410
or or in this one it's already covering

1674
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:56,200
IP modem it is covered yes

1675
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:58,450
so I'm happy about the shape model taken

1676
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:02,740
and it's definitely almost ready I would

1677
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:06,250
say I was promised last update from the

1678
01:39:02,740 --> 01:39:09,929
cultures and I'll start initiating young

1679
01:39:06,250 --> 01:39:12,580
doctor reviews and normal process to

1680
01:39:09,930 --> 01:39:26,260
