1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:38,879
once it all right I got the chopper up

2
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:44,280
yeah I could have somebody else per also

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:46,079
but you know we good if you had someone

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,309
else in the Jabbar - because I well

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,480
we're so and as usual anybody want to

6
00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:54,919
volunteer take notes anybody want to

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,919
volunteer to monitor the jabber room

8
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:59,690
everybody looks down

9
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:12,750
certainly somebody must be have the

10
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:15,410
ability to take notes yeah just on the

11
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:20,330
ether pad and nothing major just

12
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:27,180
decisions all right was that so that's

13
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:29,580
all right good all right and I'm honored

14
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,410
with a everyone everybody wants to look

15
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:38,700
over his shoulder to catch where he

16
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:40,320
misses something in the Internet all

17
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:47,030
right I think we can probably start I

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,690
think I see most people we need okay

19
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:55,380
welcome everybody

20
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:57,269
hey BT core our note takers take her

21
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,370
back there I'm monitoring Jabbar but

22
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,510
everybody else most much cover also your

23
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,310
your Dan you're not taking it either pad

24
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:08,459
right yeah great perfect anyone can join

25
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,840
the other pet so blue sheets are going

26
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,880
around or possibly have already gone

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,069
around if you I see one sitting up to

28
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:19,109
the front so he didn't get one come get

29
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:21,869
one all right we record a Medeco

30
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,220
no well it's the last session of the

31
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:32,340
week so hopefully while seemless already

32
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:37,760
if not welcome to the ietf agenda so

33
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,560
rachel is not here she is switching jobs

34
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,600
switching roles at her current at Huawei

35
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,270
so it's not clear she'll be able to be

36
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,560
coming to the idea or I think it is

37
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,210
actually is clear that she will not be

38
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
able to be coming to the IETF anymore

39
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,780
so probably want to talk to Barry about

40
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,450
that at some point if he still thinks we

41
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:59,190
need three chairs so did she confirm

42
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,929
that to you that she won't be coming in

43
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,310
the future because when I left okay yeah

44
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,950
cuz when I talked with her she wasn't

45
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,240
certain yet what the future would be she

46
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:15,320
didn't come now so the three the three

47
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,390
of us should talk with her at some point

48
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,810
we do have one agenda Bash Colin needs

49
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,099
to be in another working group or

50
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,300
actually research group for the

51
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,590
beginning of the session so we're moving

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:30,150
his to the later that's what happens

53
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,390
when he's our TF chair he needs to be at

54
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:37,530
the IR D F so sessions amazing how that

55
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:40,530
works other than that you see we've got

56
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,650
the V BBC presentation and real-time

57
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:47,429
text for multi-party conference as well

58
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:57,120
so that's what we've got up on the

59
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:58,919
agenda our working group documents three

60
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,500
of them are still in the in the cluster

61
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,510
338 so that'll come out whenever that

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:10,140
comes out and we're not stressing about

63
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:11,159
it one is on one is waiting on frame

64
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,840
marking so hopefully we'll get that

65
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:24,510
resolved today and then multiplex

66
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:27,659
guidelines so the opening is one of the

67
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:30,849
here I'm speaking as one of the authors

68
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,039
of the document editor

69
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:36,310
we missed during the process to an

70
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,229
address Bernard's comment and hopefully

71
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,259
I will do it next week so I'll probably

72
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:44,620
have to ask probably from Bernard for

73
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:50,650
some clarification but I'll try to do it

74
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:53,610
next week and the last one di feedback

75
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,989
CC Fitbit message that's the one that

76
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:05,110
Colleen is going to present when he

77
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:14,199
comes to frame marking Mau do you want

78
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:19,900
to speak to this most nineties editor of

79
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:24,759
the frame working so we updated to

80
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:28,568
version 10 based on Dale's substantial

81
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:31,750
feedback let me preface this with it was

82
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:34,360
it was quite a bit of quite a quite a

83
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,930
few comments and I think several of them

84
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,190
required some substantive changes so

85
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,539
unfortunate I think we do need to go

86
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,449
through another working with last call

87
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:45,818
to make sure that those changes are ok

88
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:47,199
with everyone I'll summarize them

89
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:48,909
briefly but I think people are gonna

90
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,500
need some more time to digest it and

91
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:54,009
make sure that we're not breaking

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,639
anything with these changes so the the

93
00:06:54,009 --> 00:07:00,090
first major item was and I guess we're

94
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:03,400
on a you should pay attention to this

95
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:05,650
the floor reserved bits that used to be

96
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,859
in the short format you know where the

97
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,630
with a temple area ID and the and the

98
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:14,469
base layer SiC bit with those bottom

99
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:18,849
four bits were all zeros in the short

100
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:23,110
extension format and since we added the

101
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:25,349
ability to omit in the long format the

102
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:30,250
other parameters so that made it

103
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:32,770
ambiguous whether something was dead

104
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:37,680
zero with B equals zero or whether

105
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,680
something was a non scalable

106
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:45,159
extension where you should ignore those

107
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:45,969
so it's really not possible to reserve

108
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,680
them for future use

109
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:52,808
which one is draft was relying on them

110
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,909
being available for future use for the

111
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:56,259
non scheduled extensions only if you

112
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,360
knew that beforehand that you're only

113
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:00,939
ever going to use non-scalable streams

114
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,439
through some other signaling you knew

115
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,879
that there was only non-scalable screws

116
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:06,009
that's not time you can really reuse

117
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,169
those bits if you had a case where there

118
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,969
could be scalable and on scaleable

119
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,128
streams then there's no way you could

120
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,860
reuse those bits because there's no

121
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,199
distinguish the two so this current

122
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:20,289
version explicitly says that those bits

123
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,569
are always zero and they're not

124
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:30,270
available for future use for

125
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:33,099
non-scalable streams those as a

126
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,110
individual I'd say that that's you know

127
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,089
if you do need to change system adding

128
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,550
some gets you probably want to put

129
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,740
something in the signaling anyway so

130
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:44,228
that's probably you need not do it

131
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,940
different you neither see they need a

132
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:47,500
different header extension or right I

133
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,529
mean this thing is just to have a

134
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,959
different you are n or n parameter after

135
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:56,019
three marking but that's essentially a

136
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,029
different extension ID so you could

137
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,470
differentiate them that way but that

138
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:02,290
essentially is a different header

139
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,910
extension at that point so if you know

140
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,380
if Ronnie wanted to pursue the priority

141
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,870
work you just have a different you are n

142
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,630
then frame marking and you could then

143
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,899
you could reuse those bits but with the

144
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:17,050
base with the base ER n that's specified

145
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,370
in frame marking it wouldn't be wouldn't

146
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,219
be advisable that we use those bits

147
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,720
almost somehow the application knew that

148
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:29,649
there's no chance of scaleable streams

149
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:32,319
coming in this the next point was in the

150
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,439
case where you're in the base temple

151
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:38,620
layer 0 the B bit which is base layer

152
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:39,730
sink is sort of useless because you're

153
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,990
obviously in the base layer so

154
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,819
everything only depends on the base

155
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,550
layer and they'll pointed out that it

156
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:47,800
was an oddity that the baby that would

157
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,329
always need to be one in that in that

158
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,699
case because you you only

159
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:54,049
on the base layer but in other cases we

160
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:56,899
say that the be a bit of zero for

161
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,179
example for non scribble streams so to

162
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,779
clean that up I just forced the nib it

163
00:09:59,179 --> 00:10:06,529
always be zero when the ten is zero that

164
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:08,899
way it's clear that the natural the

165
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,480
natural case is when something is

166
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,910
ignored at zero so then you don't have

167
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,949
to always set it to 1 and then in the

168
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,040
base layer it's just always zero in the

169
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:22,399
base layer so that seems a little bit

170
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,248
cleaner that's a substantive change and

171
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,129
the next changes tells your epic index

172
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:32,809
the current draft the older draft said

173
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:34,100
that it counts the typical zero frames

174
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:35,899
and that's not completely accurate

175
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,699
that's from the combination of typical

176
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:40,220
zero and lid equals zero so it's

177
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:44,359
basically the base layer not just the

178
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:48,769
temple base so clarified that it's both

179
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:54,470
to zero and with zero that that labels

180
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:57,559
the TSR pick index next change is that

181
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,959
if you don't have a tid it's implicitly

182
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:02,839
zero so basically non-scalable streams

183
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:06,709
are flat and they they only have that

184
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:11,389
simple base tipler's ero and similarly

185
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:12,799
lids are implicitly zero when you're

186
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,089
using the a short extension so if you

187
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,579
don't specify it you're in the base

188
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,290
special layer and if you omit it in the

189
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,209
long extension same thing it's

190
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,248
implicitly zero some text to clarify

191
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:25,268
that that's not stuffs into this just

192
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:29,449
clarification they are ID mappings

193
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:31,699
that's also just clarification it wasn't

194
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:32,868
obvious to some other readers that if

195
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,790
you're having non-scalable stream

196
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:37,790
there's no layer IDs and so there's no

197
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:41,329
mappings clarified that must rest and

198
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:44,540
then finally the editorial changed just

199
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:47,089
to not show the header extension ID with

200
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:49,309
a specific value it was more the

201
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:51,939
specific value in some of the sections

202
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:54,618
and it should be a question mark that's

203
00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:56,899
negotiated by signaling that's all

204
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:58,249
changes but I think we do have to go

205
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,339
through the work with boss called heaven

206
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:03,230
everybody digest those my inclination

207
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,120
would be to say like the first two weeks

208
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,400
of December so

209
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,480
it's after the Thanksgiving holidays for

210
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:16,060
Americans and before the Christmas

211
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:18,270
holidays Bernardo bulla Microsoft I have

212
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,119
just a clarifying question for you mo

213
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:24,460
because the fray marking draft is

214
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,020
relatively simple to implement it's

215
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,770
attractive to play with for things like

216
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,960
a v1 and the question has arisen as to

217
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:35,350
which loads of baby one it is applicable

218
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,750
for so my taking tell me I'm wrong or

219
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:41,800
not is that it applies for the tempo

220
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:47,020
modes and this normal kind of spatial

221
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,240
modes but not for the KS v c or c shift

222
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:53,860
modes or any of those weird things or

223
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:57,070
this I'm surprised you're asking you

224
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:03,339
Bernard because I think you're well

225
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:06,810
aware that the promoters of 81 are not

226
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:12,459
actively binding to this specification

227
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:15,699
so if if people wanted to go outside of

228
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:18,489
what 81 specifies and bind to this

229
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,500
specification yeah

230
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:24,370
the cases where you haven't you know

231
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:29,589
nested temple hierarchies would would be

232
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:31,900
usable by this but that's kind of is

233
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,089
difficult to say other and that we

234
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,910
should recommend and have a section 481

235
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:38,589
about this because you know the first of

236
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:44,189
all there is no any one art speed you

237
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:47,500
have not in not ITF draft for that and

238
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,880
if there ever were one it's my

239
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,100
understanding is it's likely not to

240
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,770
specify a binding to frame marking it

241
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:58,420
would have its own type of descriptive

242
00:13:53,770 --> 00:14:01,030
marks I mention this because

243
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:04,270
a frame marking is currently in library

244
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,770
RTC and so when a v1 is added in you

245
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:11,199
have to figure out what do you do with

246
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:13,030
it and even if we don't mention a v1

247
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,950
just understanding what kinds of modes

248
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,980
because some of these modes also exist

249
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:27,330
in vp9 just understanding the

250
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:29,170
applicability of a draft

251
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:37,390
do we have a slide for that

252
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:40,719
vp9 finally thank you so just it just

253
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:44,350
for clarification is as far as I

254
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,810
understand that for the frame out theme

255
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,920
for any new codecs which are not part of

256
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,959
this document didn't need to be

257
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,939
specified elsewhere because we are

258
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,520
closing this one so if you don't need

259
00:14:51,940 --> 00:15:00,850
for everyone you need someplace to write

260
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:02,829
it yeah that's correct it's just the

261
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,230
more question comes up for vp9 as well

262
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,610
so just just having a clear

263
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,840
understanding of which modes it's

264
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,460
applicable to it just be helpful yeah I

265
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,860
mean I think the vp9 draft does mention

266
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,650
its frame marking mappings in it but

267
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,170
again it's only I think frame marking is

268
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,850
pretty clear that it's only for these

269
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:24,610
simple and common scalability structures

270
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:27,280
and you know all codecs can do weird

271
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,590
things only but you know only difference

272
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,569
is how easily can they describe them but

273
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,890
they can all be weird and frame working

274
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:37,170
is only for the things we thought were

275
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,170
the simple cases when we were writing it

276
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:43,540
yeah it's just it's just helpful to give

277
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,400
an example of of modes because a lot of

278
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,560
things look weird to a lot of people and

279
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,050
just the question is where that where

280
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,939
the boundary is do you want text in this

281
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,199
document saying here are some examples

282
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,880
of things that are specifically out of

283
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,790
scope and not supported like this for

284
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:02,470
marking yeah I mean doing this yeah I

285
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,480
mean as an example there are you know we

286
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:07,570
have this now standard nomenclature to

287
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,240
describe the modes and so you could say

288
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,330
like KS vici modes or shift modes are

289
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,540
not supported

290
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,980
and normal temporal and spatial notes

291
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:25,310
would be yeah something like that

292
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:27,440
Oh looks unhappy I mean you know given

293
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,359
that those are just you know just

294
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,010
recently within a few months you know I

295
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,850
mentioned and you know widespread

296
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:36,050
deployed so I I belittle averse to

297
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,360
starting to enumerate things that are

298
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,380
newish because that list could be you

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,700
know I worked really long and if they

300
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,080
never see deployment then it's kind of

301
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:47,210
you know we mentioned those things I

302
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,650
think it's cleaner and what want any

303
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,930
might things and then have someone say

304
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:52,160
oh well you didn't write this so it must

305
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:53,959
be in scope so it's kind of ambiguous

306
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,660
whether or not something that's not her

307
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,130
enumerated you know is in or out of

308
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,990
scope so I think it's cleaner just to

309
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,330
say only these very very well-defined

310
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:06,260
streams are in scope and everything else

311
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:08,569
is out of scope okay big what will

312
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:11,329
happen so that's why we have either be

313
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,919
so we make a new definition for frame

314
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,839
mounting like you suggested we may need

315
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,300
a different a different structure a

316
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:19,099
different a different bill other expense

317
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,629
extension for a first specific one so

318
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:22,550
but that's we don't have to decide it

319
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,410
now because now we are closing based on

320
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:29,990
the current text that there is a current

321
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:33,640
called exit out there yeah so it sounds

322
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,620
like that

323
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,960
are we good if we just you know

324
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,879
acknowledge this to ourselves but don't

325
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,560
put that text in the draft describing

326
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,380
these things and think of current text

327
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,750
saying we only describe the case case we

328
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:51,440
do handle does it officially save us not

329
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,550
use if doing something weird I mean I

330
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,020
may be free marketing should explicitly

331
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,919
say must not use if you're doing

332
00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:01,340
something that doesn't match these

333
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:03,410
patterns but I don't think you have to

334
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,780
prohibit it it just won't be efficient

335
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:12,290
right it's not it won't blow up your

336
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:14,600
network of anything the worry is that

337
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,460
you know if your it depends what what

338
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,990
the wrong thing is yeah forward too much

339
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,640
stuff

340
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,120
it'll just waste bandwidth but you it

341
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,930
won't cause stuff not to render if you

342
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:33,949
don't forward the right stuff yes

343
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:38,550
to home right there so knows an audience

344
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:40,530
it's explicitly stated in that in that

345
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,620
skillet a structure section that it is

346
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,210
not recommended for other you know

347
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:55,860
complex or irregular scalability

348
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:58,760
structures I mean it's a the creator of

349
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,350
the structure knows better than we do

350
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,000
whether or not it would work with frame

351
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,790
markings so I think to actually prohibit

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,970
it and you would be the wrong thing you

353
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:11,399
know if I'm if I'm creating a complex

354
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,010
structure but I'm clever enough to make

355
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,560
it work the same as nested structures

356
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,870
then I should be prohibited from being

357
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:24,090
able to use the frame marking you know

358
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:25,469
approach but I could go either way and I

359
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,600
prefer to leave the text as is not

360
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,680
recommended but I was a little too

361
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,719
strong in the room not recommended

362
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,590
doesn't don't see any contradiction so

363
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,620
okay let's leave it as it is all right

364
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,030
so you dressed if anybody objects will

365
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,070
do it and working to west call all right

366
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,230
so yeah so I think probably whatever

367
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,179
there's like the week after will start

368
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,720
like the we got the Thanksgiving and

369
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:58,890
kill for two weeks all right great thank

370
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:02,460
you okay yeah so we so it depends on you

371
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,510
put them in your weaker my week we

372
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,200
should decide we said which of us is

373
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:12,510
issuing that oh okay all right so you

374
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,070
got to okay so we have I mean since we

375
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:17,790
were chopped still give them as an X

376
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:20,669
payload document so we have the G is G

377
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:25,080
TS visas they're still an open issue and

378
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:26,150
open discuss and of the relationship

379
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,220
today

380
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:35,310
ts visas document and we could be

381
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:38,730
addressed the ttml just this week they

382
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,320
put the in lieu 0-6 version which

383
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,170
addressed the comments and it's now

384
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,280
already was a also already to the RFC

385
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:49,860
Attica so this one is is finished it's

386
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,629
that it's nice G toy already will be in

387
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:58,889
the IFC editor it's me for this week at

388
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:01,830
the other work on the first one the

389
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:04,790
status there is where the author's are

390
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:08,010
waiting for the ad to respond correct

391
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,480
I'm not sure I think I think they that's

392
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,040
I'll have to look it because my

393
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,590
understanding is that there was the

394
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:18,240
issue about how it's related to to

395
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,820
internally into the text that's in the

396
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,870
TSA Vietnamese point for that is it a

397
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,000
normative reference information

398
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,350
informative what to do is it or to

399
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,420
include the text I think that's the

400
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,520
point that is open there right but I

401
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,130
think the elastics the last message was

402
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,400
from the author and it's waiting for an

403
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:37,320
ad response I think and if as I'll

404
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,270
double-check that and if it's so I will

405
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:43,860
I will beat on the idea this afternoon

406
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:46,920
okay the other the working with

407
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,929
documents we have that route the payload

408
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,550
was registered by group from Etsy to the

409
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:52,890
our cycle the auto submit to the zero

410
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:54,600
three version he's ready for a new plus

411
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,050
Cole I'll just check with the author's

412
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:03,510
and if they're okay then we will do last

413
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:05,010
call the JPEG X s there were common so

414
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:07,800
the least and the auto address that in

415
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,440
this new version we need more reviews I

416
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,480
will again ask on the list and ask them

417
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,220
also to get reviewers because sometimes

418
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,910
they're Jews are coming from outside our

419
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:22,320
regular community vp9 here we have to be

420
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:25,890
ok yeah so I did a minor refresh and I

421
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,080
think it was a one minor update but

422
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,640
there's still it's still basically

423
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,010
waiting on a bunch of informative texts

424
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,860
which I was hoping that my co-authors

425
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,700
would write and they haven't so it might

426
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:42,240
be that we need to find some other

427
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,160
volunteer to write that text just sort

428
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,740
of like an overview of how the vp9 codec

429
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,480
as a whole works I mean this has been

430
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,820
you know deployed in production for

431
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,040
a number several years now in the Chrome

432
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,649
browser so not as having this is an

433
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:02,730
individual as an ID is slightly

434
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:04,440
embarrassing so so I guess we should

435
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:08,640
probably so

436
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,550
look just III don't know but just

437
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,320
publish whatever you have yeah I don't

438
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:16,260
think you need to explain an explanatory

439
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,750
text about how a codec works when when

440
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,120
there is actually sample code that's in

441
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,820
production for years yeah I mean I can

442
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,830
just get that yeah my only concern is if

443
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,970
there's stuff in the in the payload

444
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,970
header which you actually need for

445
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,780
that's true so if you're if you're

446
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,640
fencing a document that include the

447
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,040
information you just point and say go

448
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,530
read there that's okay because if it's

449
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,899
mostly if it's informative if it's not

450
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:50,850
something that you need in order to to

451
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,310
use the payload or descend the payload

452
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,860
did not the payload the RTP payload okay

453
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,629
so let's just verify the fan if there's

454
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,379
no issues with that then we can do it

455
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:04,320
last call and finish with that okay so

456
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:07,890
that's okay is that yeah I guess I'll

457
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,120
just go probably go and I mean yes it'll

458
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,060
be a little sparse in terms of

459
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:17,159
descriptions of vp9 but you know better

460
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:18,870
than our perpetual ID so this was a

461
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,180
conversation not between the two chairs

462
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:24,989
but between the show and the video just

463
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:28,650
to be clear so the last word that

464
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:31,710
there's a new individual drop the RTP

465
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:35,690
pellets words for the PVC coating to

466
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,690
represent it later okay

467
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:42,030
we have to go back to the goals in

468
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:43,590
milestone and you think see that what to

469
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:48,450
need update but currently we have the

470
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:50,179
tetrarch's already passed you the RTP

471
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,040
header extension for video frame

472
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,080
hopefully we probably hopefully will

473
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,139
have it by January or February we'll be

474
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,720
able to send it for publication so we

475
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:06,450
need to update this this date

476
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:10,799
the that's the June 2019 that's the

477
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:12,030
draft for calling hopefully is done we

478
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,910
hear about it when he does this

479
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:17,070
presentation because we will ask why

480
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:20,720
it's not finished yet and it's mostly

481
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:25,860
because Colleen is trying to steal some

482
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,660
stomach texts to add to that vp9 we

483
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,709
discussed now will change the will

484
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:34,220
update the the milestone the JPEG X

485
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:37,710
still we still have time estate and the

486
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:46,980
TTL is already done so we have to just

487
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:49,710
change it to them anything anything else

488
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:56,549
on that before we start the individual

489
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:57,720
presentations CDC I guess because we're

490
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:01,559
still waiting on Collin to get back oh

491
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,960
wait sorry F this one oh it's Collins

492
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:22,860
here so we can have to be on Bosch this

493
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:25,530
week a nun - did you suck in so before

494
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,809
we go into the specific stuff I mean

495
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:31,230
unless anyone knows living in a cave I'm

496
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:33,899
sure there's a lot of energy around you

497
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:35,490
transport formats and potentially media

498
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,960
over those new transport formats and

499
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:42,210
whether or not it uses the same you know

500
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,980
formats as abt is defined or not is

501
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,750
still an open question so if anybody

502
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,130
here is not aware of that it's just a

503
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,540
strong suggest you follow like you know

504
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,820
the quick work and the rip work and all

505
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,470
that and figure out whether or not you

506
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,290
have some comments about it I understand

507
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:57,870
that Collin Jennings is planning to

508
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,129
create a mailing list for grip as soon

509
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,330
as he comes up with a better name for it

510
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,330
so he knows what it named Llanelli must

511
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,900
you will make sure that this won't be

512
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:07,980
kinda yeah I'll make sure I'm the code

513
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,230
that will make sure that when this is

514
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,250
announced with it's also announced on

515
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,250
the ABT balanced

516
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:19,389
okay hi I'm Colin Perkins I want to talk

517
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:23,230
about RTP congestion control feedback so

518
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,760
the draft content technical content has

519
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,880
not changed in the slightest in this

520
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,220
revision there have been precisely free

521
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,800
updates one of which is to fix my core

522
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:37,650
Mallos contact details one of which is

523
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:41,050
to mention the REM B format along with

524
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:43,300
my minds blanking timber and that sort

525
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:45,610
of thing the other is to add a paragraph

526
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,760
which discusses a relation with the

527
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:51,100
Hulman draft and essentially all this

528
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,620
points out is that you the home address

529
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,110
adds a night EP header extensions give a

530
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,909
packet sequence number and then reports

531
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,909
that as a sequence number for the

532
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,050
aggregates in the reports and this uses

533
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,360
the sequence numbers which are already

534
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,370
in the packets and reports the SSS here

535
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,780
in the per flow sequence numbers and it

536
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:09,070
just points out the obvious thing that

537
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,170
if you're adding a per packet sequence

538
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:13,419
number this adds you overhead per packet

539
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:14,980
but simplifies the reporting if what you

540
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,020
want to do is can get congestion control

541
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,210
the aggregate and the approach in this

542
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,830
mechanism and has less overhead per

543
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,900
packet but has slightly more complex

544
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,429
reporting and gives you makes it easier

545
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:28,570
to congestion control the individual

546
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:30,850
flows and perhaps also integrates better

547
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,879
with the rest of RTP which also reports

548
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:36,399
sequence numbers per SSRC so hopefully

549
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:40,030
this is a sufficiently neutral

550
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:43,150
description of the trade-offs and will

551
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:44,770
not cause great objections hopefully

552
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,270
that addresses the action item I had to

553
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,120
clarify the relation between these two

554
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:53,379
drafts with that I believe this draft is

555
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,239
ready for working group last call I see

556
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,140
some nods on that anybody disagree with

557
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,370
that you figure out the timing of this

558
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:07,570
so we're not running too many working

559
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:11,080
device calls at once but let's see yes

560
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:13,600
any problem one yeah basically I guess

561
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,010
we can do them both or I've been the

562
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,949
same considerations apply we want to

563
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:22,900
avoid you know the holiday season I

564
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:24,910
think but oh yeah well I must

565
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,500
I'm not unless we think we get about a

566
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,230
fortnight between holiday season

567
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,760
right yeah so so I guess but so probably

568
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,530
overlapping this with very marketing

569
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,900
it's fine I don't think it's neither of

570
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,240
them are terribly long so nothing either

571
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,100
of them will require yeah and this this

572
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,230
has been bashed upon quite a lot so I

573
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,649
think my guess is anyone who wishes to

574
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,810
comment has already done sir yeah so I

575
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:50,710
mean well I guess big make sure this

576
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:57,310
goes to our own cat as well as ATT for

577
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:59,560
yes on the prior note about the new

578
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:01,629
trance performance Thank You c'n for

579
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,850
writing all this up concisely because I

580
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,470
think this will be very informative for

581
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,480
people trying to design those new

582
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:09,150
formats and thinking about how feedback

583
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,190
and reliability and recovery work

584
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:14,170
because it helps to really distill what

585
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,250
is needed for a media application some

586
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,890
people that are reviewing those new

587
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:20,590
protocols should review calls draft in

588
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:23,320
parallel and understand what's missing

589
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,679
in the current transport drafts yeah

590
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,780
there's a companion draft which is in

591
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,520
our MCAT which needs work which talks

592
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,590
about the feedback rates and you have

593
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,180
heads or the different feedback rates so

594
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,850
which may be of interest to people as

595
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,140
well and now this is finished there you

596
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,520
know it would make sense to update that

597
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,150
one because it depends on the details of

598
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,530
this format

599
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,600
somehow do you think we should actually

600
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,120
I mean we should actually send this last

601
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,709
call to other working groups are just

602
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:54,129
hope they're paying attention to our

603
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:55,630
MCAT and apt III would greatly doubt

604
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,800
that those other groups are paying

605
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,630
attention to something like this because

606
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,220
media is kind of worked on their side

607
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,760
right now

608
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:07,780
so it wouldn't hurt to ask them to

609
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,580
consider it but I think specifically if

610
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,180
you ask the quick folks that are working

611
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,310
on the recovery draft to take a look at

612
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,950
this because recovery mechanisms and

613
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,820
reliability mechanisms and

614
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,940
acknowledgments and things like that are

615
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,639
are critical for media and they should

616
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,010
understand why and how they're critical

617
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,080
for media which this draft lays out but

618
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,270
I think that's more izi for information

619
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,129
here is something we we we believe we

620
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,810
need for doing media and you may wish to

621
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,030
consider it in your design decisions

622
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,870
rather than we once change it based on

623
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:43,450
what they're doing in

624
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:47,679
I usually provide this information in

625
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,930
the in the AK frame so it looks similar

626
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,180
I mean in terms of least information if

627
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,559
you've seen on I mean you can say but it

628
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,800
was mentioned to them that they're

629
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:59,170
similar working on cut for a long time

630
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,750
as I understand in the current quick

631
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,600
formats it's speaking entirely as an

632
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,640
individual and a somewhat uninformed one

633
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,559
the current quick act formats do not

634
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,559
actually have arrival timestamps just

635
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,678
just the counter is not the timestamp so

636
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,600
it might be something that we would need

637
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,070
to ask them to you know or not we but

638
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,419
media people would need to ask them to

639
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,428
put back sometime in the future for

640
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,500
media but yes that's not this working

641
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:27,760
groups problem directly and worse than

642
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,490
the timestamp there's also things like

643
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,100
you know recommendations that things

644
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:35,020
should not be act you know or delay

645
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,360
should be delayed or something which you

646
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,160
know what those media congestion

647
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,820
controllers that would pretty did lay

648
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,260
backs with this as well sometimes we're

649
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,210
not suggesting you back every packet

650
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:54,070
with this it was just in you AK every

651
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:56,410
frame every couple of frames well I do

652
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,300
like this idea of like educating others

653
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:01,090
like what we need for media and stuff

654
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,700
like that but it sharing this to this

655
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:05,850
last call to multiple working group

656
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,320
would I would like to make that decision

657
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:11,800
based on like what exactly this working

658
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,950
would like to get this input from if you

659
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:16,750
if you share it to some other working

660
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:20,230
group on this as though you do did this

661
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:22,600
change and all these impacts are is this

662
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:24,340
working or willing to take those I from

663
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,230
quick working group coming like okay you

664
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,659
need to change these and that rather

665
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:31,120
than I think it should be like working

666
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,890
last all in every arm cat and an

667
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,530
informational saying like guys were

668
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:42,790
happening but you make a specific like

669
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:46,678
this is for your information only yeah

670
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,678
he's probably good idea

671
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,060
I mostly agree with dread but um that

672
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,950
you know there's a few things that are

673
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,960
like we don't want conflicts between the

674
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,850
areas like I think that you know the

675
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,900
quick stuff says you know I w10

676
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,429
everywhere basically

677
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,130
I forget : whether or not your draft

678
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,450
says ah w10 is okay this dress there's

679
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,440
nothing about congestion control

680
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,240
whatsoever

681
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,950
it's just feedback that there are a

682
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,300
bunch of proposals in our a bunch of

683
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,980
congestion control candidates in our

684
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,760
MCATs but that's a different group and

685
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:18,639
most of them RFC's already yeah okay I

686
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,040
think we should be okay I mean I guess

687
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,679
the only thing would be like if they say

688
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,810
oh no you know millisecond level timing

689
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,429
is not nearly good enough we need you

690
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,320
know microsecond timing or something

691
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,770
like that but even that seems pretty

692
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:35,590
marginal yeah so yeah my inclination

693
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:37,360
would be to say I mean my suggestion

694
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,010
would be that we let's call this here in

695
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,480
film our MCAT that the last call is

696
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,950
happening since it came out of that and

697
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:48,280
directly relates to that group and then

698
00:34:41,949 --> 00:35:15,359
we're done okay yeah I agree with what

699
00:34:48,280 --> 00:35:15,360
do you say yeah oh no this one I think

700
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:27,640
sure Jo former chanson not sure if IHF

701
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,450
has offices for how to fill mercy to

702
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,930
first-time ITF presenters if we do

703
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:39,210
please to follow if we don't ask

704
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:47,440
question use your own gist question so

705
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:48,190
we pillow form it just really brief

706
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,760
instructions

707
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:53,950
what is BBC anything it's a just me some

708
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,650
of the key point she's one of the hybrid

709
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:59,919
video codecs similar to BBC TV see in

710
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:02,830
Tim targets finalization in the first

711
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,660
version which is July 2020 you know

712
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,430
similar has the pictures ammunition

713
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,649
makers of support mq sighs machine

714
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,859
precision approach inch event areas the

715
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:15,730
Mille Lacs HTV see so similar to

716
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:18,340
everyone and BBC has supported all

717
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:22,180
currency stability system Pro special I

718
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,520
say or it's also tablet II a similar

719
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,009
premise aircon seven and now here a

720
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:31,180
concept similar to the all these hybrid

721
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:33,760
codecs so our approach to really see

722
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:37,060
pillow format designs to really start

723
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,670
from the service of NIH most Peace Corps

724
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:42,220
is widely deployed in and generally

725
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,500
works even though there are some still

726
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:47,259
open issues and some stuff we should not

727
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,790
exercise at all but that's our starting

728
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:51,750
point

729
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:54,310
most apples to the changes in our header

730
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:57,610
our current first strapless doesn't

731
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:59,259
reflect the newest to change but we were

732
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:03,820
a petition wants the general meeting in

733
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:06,070
GV at 2020 so our design press was

734
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:09,940
really trying to remove as much

735
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:12,880
accomplished as we can base our studies

736
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:18,010
allows for things in cement now

737
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,410
is not applicable at all okay so that's

738
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,120
a way of trying to go for with a clean

739
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,549
design

740
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,770
so our first step is all to trying to do

741
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,060
B this transport player first right and

742
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,850
all the silicon is somebody gonna come

743
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,120
last it's not because we forgot it it

744
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,819
better

745
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,339
we'll do that later um so we targeted

746
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,200
this thing right after a baby see our

747
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:42,160
first version which is next to an Atari

748
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,359
after July you'll Ambridge so that's

749
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,060
pretty much the overview

750
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:51,250
really see if any questions just move

751
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:52,690
forward just so I understand currently

752
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,160
we're just putting the work it's still

753
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,900
time until we have to do it because

754
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,779
you're looking for the exact region yes

755
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:02,050
and another question will be a reference

756
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,580
in any of the really co2 66 to the RTP

757
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,500
payload format because in the past Mew

758
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:09,720
they needed the RFC number it was like a

759
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:14,770
situation is there some reference there

760
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:16,569
reference it's just for the the the ITU

761
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,210
is system layer standards are pretty

762
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,340
much dead so I don't expect that the

763
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,410
dependency we had in the past to 323 and

764
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,780
things like that well be an issue here

765
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,850
we're not on a time pressure not an

766
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:33,100
artificial time pressure there's

767
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:35,410
discussion over in 3gpp essay 4 - that's

768
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,940
actually in work item that they want to

769
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,490
perhaps reference that and they would

770
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,890
need it but you know and that's not so

771
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,930
that's not so they for the codec itself

772
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:46,120
is just for their the reference they

773
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,580
called it nd I'm talking about the

774
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:52,870
reference to the RTP payload for yeah so

775
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:57,340
in NSA for they may need that at some

776
00:38:52,870 --> 00:39:04,029
point but let's not worry about that one

777
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:11,830
I think on this one we we are not in a

778
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:14,230
brutal rush not like in the past so this

779
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:15,279
is to the overview were very over you

780
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:19,840
with the opening issues that we have

781
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,610
identified so far I have a a Celina for

782
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,440
each of them so I'm just gonna go

783
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,540
through what are we are concerning the

784
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,440
open issues the first was really

785
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,509
concerned

786
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:34,299
well concern is something we need to

787
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:36,039
discuss the two the transport mode Mrs T

788
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:38,799
and M are empty

789
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:40,930
then the second is really discussion was

790
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:43,420
we need for the pocket package anymore

791
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:47,230
ma BC which is defined in the semi semi

792
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:49,230
negate that they're otherwise really c4

793
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,750
we need this answer building support

794
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:55,930
coming from this dolly basis signaling

795
00:39:52,750 --> 00:40:01,359
for the incident supporting from 7/7 and

796
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:03,549
I ate the last one we hope you can leave

797
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,680
the two chairs if we can Japanese

798
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:09,970
working group draft and move forward to

799
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:12,578
sue so the first one is a the support

800
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:15,220
with a need for the air nor stom are

801
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:18,250
Machias or srst is simply everybody

802
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:20,529
knows it in is why deployed so ii would

803
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,930
say Mrs T but those of you who don't

804
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:26,039
know what is is very carry MOT

805
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:30,520
Portuguese stream is you know transport

806
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:33,099
the distance no7 I don't have any

807
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,650
signaling SST B similarly at all so

808
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:38,859
there's a long history to be back so

809
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,319
that's even longer than I a participant

810
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:44,940
a standard so I will leave that out but

811
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:48,460
that every settler to make the STP

812
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:52,720
signaling for Mrs T are useful in our

813
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:56,829
eta contacts right somebody in the RTP

814
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,109
in the RTC web group who we have a

815
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,930
source SRC much cleansing uses already

816
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:05,828
about a boost or instructional if that's

817
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:09,520
actually not about Microsoft

818
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,569
Mrs T is not easily incorporated within

819
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,210
web RTC

820
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:16,900
I either in the API soar in the STP

821
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:19,839
right so I I think the jury is out the

822
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:33,130
jury convicted it and it's it's pretty

823
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:39,490
much gone okay that's good to know

824
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:43,360
okay last was MRI TMR empty so as far we

825
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:47,799
that's actually more like academic

826
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:50,980
exercise at that point we don't know

827
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,090
it's really supported Oddity application

828
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:57,820
given earlier to casting

829
00:41:54,090 --> 00:42:00,310
so this miss Mona said Mrs T is never

830
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:03,880
being implemented and whatever so um I

831
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:05,350
saw the questions really I guess we

832
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:14,950
don't have to ask this question anymore

833
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:19,720
I so we I should be removed just now for

834
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:22,720
the first question mostly I think we can

835
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,750
safely omit and our entity I don't

836
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:31,990
believe anyone is interested and in that

837
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:34,600
I grapple and forget about what the

838
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:37,479
complications are with Mrs T I remember

839
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:41,470
the motivations were clear that you

840
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:44,770
could you could more seriously detect

841
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:46,089
losses and things like that because you

842
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,790
have separation of the layers and

843
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:51,250
therefore we have sequence numbering

844
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,779
independent for all of those layers but

845
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:56,770
I suppose that with something like frame

846
00:42:52,780 --> 00:43:00,250
marking maybe maybe the the ambiguities

847
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:06,820
that you get with with srst aren't as

848
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:08,680
bad as they used to be but I don't look

849
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,740
well completely shutting the bell on and

850
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,890
on for simplicity on floor eliminating

851
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,240
as many modes as we can I just wonder

852
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:17,410
whether there's anybody has actually

853
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,330
thought about are people actually

854
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,450
already doing the marsh team don't even

855
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:23,950
realize it certainly simulcast is going

856
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:25,660
across different RTP streams right

857
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:32,410
nobody's bundling all the simulcast

858
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:35,109
streams into one stream so I mean

859
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:39,009
Bernard Abell mic so we implemented Mrs

860
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:40,960
T for h.264 and one of the arguments is

861
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:43,030
you don't have to rewrite this sequence

862
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,030
numbers so there's a little bit of an

863
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:50,260
efficiency there but a lot of complexity

864
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:52,339
that you get out of doing it so I am not

865
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,029
aware of anybody doing that with a TV

866
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:58,190
see it is done with h.264 but still my

867
00:43:56,029 --> 00:44:00,969
please look that's all a summer research

868
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:05,299
I didn't see me

869
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:08,779
so today if someone is doing it with

870
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:13,670
h.265 with htpc then they are doing it

871
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:15,979
not in compliance with with 77 98 at

872
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:21,259
least not in full compliance the reason

873
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:26,689
is that the signalling defined in 77 98

874
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:29,930
does not support Mrs T and there's

875
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:34,489
actually a comment to that regard in in

876
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:37,219
there in 77 98 yeah so so this is an

877
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:39,739
this is an area that was under specified

878
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:43,400
because we wanted to ship this thing out

879
00:44:39,739 --> 00:44:45,589
of the door at the time for external

880
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,210
dependencies that were good and valid or

881
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,430
were thought to be good invalid at the

882
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:51,170
time so we left that open we had

883
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:53,749
references informative references to

884
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:55,999
drafts and stuff in there in the hope

885
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:59,118
that someone gets an act together ones

886
00:44:55,999 --> 00:45:02,118
one certain drafts from that were kind

887
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,049
of clocked over in RTC web once those

888
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:08,029
drafts were were were done that someone

889
00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:10,190
would get the act together and do abyss

890
00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:12,950
or something no one ever had the energy

891
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:15,529
no one no one cared yeah that's that's

892
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:18,410
not only because of the success or lack

893
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:22,819
thereof of HEV C and in the video

894
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:23,328
conferencing business but also no one

895
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:26,509
cared

896
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:29,089
right no one cared it I hate to have

897
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:31,150
stale text that but we read what

898
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:34,339
question one says should we do it now

899
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:36,799
should we wait for a companion document

900
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:40,430
to do it later if anyone cares

901
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:42,769
or should we person to be Papa do it the

902
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:46,879
same thing that we did with 711 98 and

903
00:45:42,769 --> 00:45:48,919
do it in abyss and both later options

904
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,009
are something which I'm kind of him

905
00:45:48,920 --> 00:46:00,589
maybe the first one I just say no we

906
00:45:52,009 --> 00:46:04,069
shouldn't write to support any stream

907
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:05,560
roads and nobody wants them so yeah I

908
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:09,130
mean

909
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:12,790
that's easier again my cherub does

910
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:15,850
anybody actually want to do the work

911
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:19,840
from all these three modes that sounds

912
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:22,720
like though we should yep great all

913
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,540
right so environment T is auto question

914
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:27,250
right so when we when with that and then

915
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:30,700
the last one so Bella the fourth noise

916
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:33,550
also come all right so I need four Paki

917
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:36,700
right history so I don't want to go

918
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:38,470
through the history again so the one of

919
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,640
the uses of the Paki extension is really

920
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:44,799
for chimp earlier structure in signal

921
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:47,410
they actually no other uses you may have

922
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,930
identified correct me if I'm wrong but

923
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:56,560
we would like to hear if there's any

924
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:59,589
other usage for Paki so this one is a

925
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,680
little bit different I do understand the

926
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:06,850
argument that some kind of RTP extension

927
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:11,950
is likely to be the way that that SF us

928
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:15,240
operate generically but you know the

929
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:17,710
thing is there there may be there are

930
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:21,189
situations in which SF use will parse

931
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:23,080
the bitstream and kind of prohibiting

932
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:25,060
that from working you know basically

933
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,890
requiring you to negotiate an arch at

934
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,710
the extension to function doesn't seem

935
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,299
quite right to me and there are also

936
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,820
other things in here I would say that

937
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,280
that can be supported as part of this

938
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,700
that may be valuable things like layer

939
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,590
drop indications again you could put it

940
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,049
in the RTP extension but it isn't in

941
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:45,880
frame marking and so you know if you

942
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,530
remove it from here there'll be

943
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,530
implications I think in some scenarios

944
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:54,839
okay different thing every funding to

945
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,779
this

946
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:04,360
so the my main point is and the thing

947
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:13,900
that's your said as well the the right

948
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:15,790
spot to put to put SF as a

949
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,130
information ever as a fuse would

950
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:22,300
typically need to do something smart to

951
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:24,550
a scalable bitstream I think is not the

952
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:28,300
payload header because the payload

953
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:31,510
header is encrypted the right spot is in

954
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:33,840
an extension to the frame marking Draft

955
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:38,920
right where that thing is not encrypted

956
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:44,110
right so the scope of that thing is only

957
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:47,620
the payload format and so far so so I

958
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:49,660
mean we we can we can volunteer please

959
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:52,299
ship this time frame marking draft

960
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:53,859
yesterday right dependent so let's get

961
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,200
that thing out of the door but I

962
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,640
officially volunteer here to think about

963
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,279
an extension mechanism of the frame

964
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:03,040
marking draft for generic stuff where we

965
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,710
can possibly make a be too happy if not

966
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,279
a be one where we can possibly make make

967
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:11,440
put what this type of stuff in but

968
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,150
throwing in a generic extension

969
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,740
mechanism of the payload header when we

970
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,330
don't have a single use case that makes

971
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,729
sense in today's world where media is

972
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:25,930
supposed to be encrypted I'm sorry I

973
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:29,110
don't at least the frame marking cells

974
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:31,299
has a section about future code okay lig

975
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,100
mapping and it says this should be part

976
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,720
of the new RTP payload format that's

977
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:41,470
what it says okay so so in other words

978
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:46,120
we may want to have in here a section

979
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:49,839
that says how to use the frame marking

980
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,490
draft for the absolutely agree thank you

981
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,100
very much for reminding me yeah that's

982
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:56,500
what we're going to do and we volunteer

983
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:59,170
to do some work there and a yeah go are

984
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:04,780
you online territory for you to grab

985
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:07,060
work to do next one yeah yeah go it's

986
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,890
muted okay yeah go well probably do it

987
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:13,080
hehe volunteer to do some work there he

988
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,080
wants to be involved so Yahoo can do it

989
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,099
person anyone fall

990
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:19,440
one on that thank you someone for

991
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:21,720
bringing up the distinction between

992
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:24,510
having things and payload headers versus

993
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,759
artsy headers like the reiterate that in

994
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:29,130
the new transport work all of his stuff

995
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,260
is going in an encrypted basically

996
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:34,710
tunnel and so we would lose the ability

997
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:37,859
to have authenticated but not encrypted

998
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:39,599
data as RTP hitters are today so people

999
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:41,520
that you know care about that should

1000
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,050
probably review the specs and figure out

1001
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,470
if that's something that's really

1002
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:59,130
necessary for for designs or not and and

1003
00:50:46,470 --> 00:51:05,520
how to solve it if it is hello

1004
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:07,349
so I I think more what's that some as

1005
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,720
write in that direction but I would

1006
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:11,820
think that the model more like what perk

1007
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,680
houses is actually what we're discussing

1008
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:17,040
is that yes you're gonna have now to

1009
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,750
encrypt the layer between the nodes in a

1010
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,940
centralized conferencing structure and

1011
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:23,730
things like that so you're really

1012
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,349
talking is is maybe more like in Prague

1013
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:29,130
how do you expose the information when

1014
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:31,050
you have the payload being encrypted and

1015
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:34,829
and then I mean really the media

1016
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:39,119
payloads so and I think if I remember

1017
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:42,240
correctly that would mean that you the

1018
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,010
payload part of RTP skarbek is enter and

1019
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,649
encrypted why not they had or extension

1020
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:48,720
students it's it's still in this booking

1021
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:51,500
good contact I think that's the the

1022
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:55,259
right way are thinking about this but I

1023
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:57,569
I wouldn't see a need for necessarily

1024
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:01,110
doing this in the in the base spec for

1025
00:51:57,569 --> 00:52:04,440
this payload format I got Magnus

1026
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:08,280
the highest runner case is his media

1027
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:09,720
nodes being able to access this but I

1028
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,130
think one of the other motivations for

1029
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,350
having our theatres and the clear was

1030
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:16,140
not necessarily a conference bridge but

1031
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:17,549
even on path elements to be able to see

1032
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,819
and do things intelligently with this

1033
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:22,950
and of course you lose that ability with

1034
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:25,830
work doesn't allow beyond bath elements

1035
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:28,080
to see you know anything about the

1036
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:29,910
header extensions if it's going really

1037
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,799
over DT less than that over RTP not

1038
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:33,799
ridiculous or to me if it's going

1039
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:42,750
miscibility yeah so it's really like you

1040
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:49,200
need some proxy there in your medium for

1041
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:51,480
doing that's not in this scope so it

1042
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,790
says you know it when we're if you join

1043
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,000
the whatever rip becomes mailing list

1044
00:52:53,790 --> 00:53:01,200
make sure that discuss it there so I

1045
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,050
have two comments one comment is that

1046
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,470
the typical lifetime of a video codec is

1047
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,240
about ten years we'll see whether we see

1048
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:11,520
initial deployment of all this modern

1049
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,160
stuff that more sites within the

1050
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,500
lifetime of this codec yeah I mean come

1051
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,540
on this we're not the fastest

1052
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,840
organization on the planet that's number

1053
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:29,340
one number two and that's probably more

1054
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:32,490
important the argument the the key

1055
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:37,560
argument for all this encryption stuff

1056
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:39,240
is or hey you know one of the key

1057
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:41,210
arguments for the frame marking draft

1058
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,950
has been as far as I understand it that

1059
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:46,080
the middle box that sits there in the

1060
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:49,439
middle of the network and is operated by

1061
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:52,590
someone else who is who is not supposed

1062
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:56,010
to see the traffic itself can act on it

1063
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:59,100
now when you have some super fancy new

1064
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:02,040
transport then you don't have to worry

1065
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:04,110
about the transport from your say

1066
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,020
sending endpoint to that middle box and

1067
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:08,640
you don't have to worry about the

1068
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:10,980
traffic from the middle box to the

1069
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,109
receiving end point but you still have

1070
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,609
to worry you still need to have some

1071
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:21,089
stuff

1072
00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:23,999
on one hand encrypted so that the metal

1073
00:54:21,089 --> 00:54:25,828
box can't see say the video signal the

1074
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:28,558
compressed media signal but on the other

1075
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:31,950
hand it has to see some controlled

1076
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:34,920
information like this right so so just

1077
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:37,799
putting them in in all in the same kind

1078
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:42,690
of giant bucket it's either encrypted or

1079
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:44,519
not in that scenario is wrong yeah so I

1080
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:46,799
think what we take out of this is that

1081
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:48,419
we have to be people who are interested

1082
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:50,489
in this work should follow what's

1083
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,680
happening in all this work that's trying

1084
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:54,329
to encrypt everything which would

1085
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:59,509
prevent so we are not living under that

1086
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:59,509
rock which Moorside that we are not

1087
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,940
because because just just as a reminder

1088
00:55:02,279 --> 00:55:07,619
we at the time we try to write it

1089
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,359
requirement for RTP under quick to

1090
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:11,549
address also to mention that there are

1091
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,410
issues with the article others that that

1092
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:16,980
are needed by the middle boxes you to

1093
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:20,190
see if you can address that right just

1094
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,200
kind of summarize I guess we are safe to

1095
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,480
say we are lean to frame working based

1096
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:33,359
solution for now how can we discuss that

1097
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:34,950
I think your question five is the

1098
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,558
question you want an answer to write

1099
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:40,410
generic payload header extension right

1100
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:43,859
so I have to do yeah yeah I think there

1101
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:46,319
is value to that I don't think it's has

1102
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:48,808
to be it may be distinct from frame

1103
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:52,430
marking but it's a generic I think he

1104
00:55:48,809 --> 00:55:52,430
means payload header extension inside

1105
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:15,089
yeah that's a yeah you think he answered

1106
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:15,930
a question five is yes you think it's

1107
00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:19,078
not okay

1108
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:22,288
it's formulated the answer to question

1109
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:26,369
five is no because we I don't think we

1110
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:27,599
need to extend the payload header itself

1111
00:56:26,369 --> 00:56:30,029
ever

1112
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:33,450
however there should be a question 5.5

1113
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:36,630
which is do we need a mapping of the

1114
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:39,058
mechanisms of the new BBC codec to the

1115
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:41,880
frame marking draft and the answer to

1116
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:43,349
that question is a resounding yes and

1117
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:46,019
then there is a third question whether

1118
00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:48,029
we need that in this document here and

1119
00:56:46,019 --> 00:56:57,348
the answer to that question is also

1120
00:56:48,029 --> 00:57:01,460
resounding yes good all right okay okay

1121
00:56:57,349 --> 00:57:03,960
all right so that will be the last ones

1122
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:06,299
we're thinking about removing the Donny

1123
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:10,529
based signaling for engineering support

1124
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:13,920
M so that's a better trend for the

1125
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:17,880
better codecs such as ABC ABC M also

1126
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,900
also HTML maybe see that we know the

1127
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:24,420
coup de selva is already good enough to

1128
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:27,930
know let's argue hole for the success

1129
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:30,989
for error concealment that's also the

1130
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:37,140
one of the question reached by Yago

1131
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:40,200
right so the question is really should

1132
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:44,700
we remove this county-based right siga

1133
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:46,558
knowledge for clean messages and to be

1134
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:51,808
even carrying a picture reversal is

1135
00:57:46,559 --> 00:58:00,450
right now no okay I guess that's a yes

1136
00:57:51,809 --> 00:58:02,579
yes great all right so that's it the

1137
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,899
question is does this group want to

1138
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:06,719
adopt this as a working group item

1139
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:09,960
that's clearly in scope yeah anybody

1140
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:12,029
object all right thank you very much

1141
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:14,069
so looking for looking for looking for

1142
00:58:12,029 --> 00:58:17,969
Mentalist

1143
00:58:14,069 --> 00:58:20,579
yeah whoo oh my lord so just fulfill

1144
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:22,079
trust for the milestone what what do you

1145
00:58:20,579 --> 00:58:26,609
think should we should have as a

1146
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:29,430
milestone date for that work after the

1147
00:58:26,609 --> 00:58:32,549
draft right after January turn Ettore

1148
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:35,609
and it's you know maybe so there's

1149
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:37,799
something there there's a newer now

1150
00:58:35,609 --> 00:58:40,259
header feature which will not include on

1151
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:44,589
the first draft

1152
00:58:40,259 --> 00:58:46,209
so so make it make it end of 2020 for

1153
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:48,609
the milestone with the understanding

1154
00:58:46,209 --> 00:58:52,779
that rarely a milestone is hid in this

1155
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:54,880
organization did you see TTML they were

1156
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:57,099
ahead because they wanted to finish that

1157
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:01,709
so that's depending again that's but

1158
00:58:57,099 --> 00:59:01,709
that's why I said rarely and not never

1159
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:41,399
hello you see you would not sure we hear

1160
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:44,380
you get can you talk we did not hear you

1161
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:47,380
know he sees the baby the médicos doing

1162
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:55,619
it for us they're paying attention and

1163
00:59:47,380 --> 01:00:01,989
we did not hear you still no okay good

1164
00:59:55,619 --> 01:00:05,889
so is it my time yes yeah so I am

1165
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:09,039
submitted good draft about the real

1166
01:00:05,889 --> 01:00:13,869
context media handling in multi-party

1167
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:17,469
conferences and made it with a music in

1168
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:20,919
the topic or in the name but it really

1169
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:29,649
affects many groups for example unity

1170
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:33,788
core next piece so what is real context

1171
01:00:29,649 --> 01:00:36,909
some basic facts it is to transmit text

1172
01:00:33,789 --> 01:00:40,719
while you create it so there is no

1173
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:42,819
special user action for sending it that

1174
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:45,369
provides tight interaction between the

1175
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:47,759
participants they don't need to wait for

1176
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:51,390
completed messages

1177
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,730
it is required now in many places for

1178
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:56,368
accessibility reasons but in fact it

1179
01:00:53,730 --> 01:01:00,540
should be it is useful for order to get

1180
01:00:56,369 --> 01:01:05,099
more live text interaction the

1181
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:08,359
presentation level is IQ tt 140 which is

1182
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:13,380
a simple standard for based on utf-8

1183
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:19,890
transmission and I ISO 6425 control

1184
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:23,700
codes we have transport for it by RTP in

1185
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:27,569
RFC 4103 where you have some robustness

1186
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:31,859
by redundancy and there is another draft

1187
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:35,700
for transport in web RTC now just in

1188
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:41,690
progress where we have the robustness or

1189
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:41,689
by the reliable type of data channel

1190
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:49,970
it's used it's specified in

1191
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:55,950
next-generation emergency services we do

1192
01:01:49,970 --> 01:02:00,890
- regular sip VoIP services and in relay

1193
01:01:55,950 --> 01:02:00,890
services so next slide please

1194
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:08,669
but the multi-party real context is not

1195
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:11,130
specified it's mentioned in many

1196
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:14,250
specifications that we need to do

1197
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:18,510
multi-party but it has never settled in

1198
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:20,849
any standards document it has been said

1199
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,550
that well you do you use regular ought

1200
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:26,760
to be mechanized but we need to settle

1201
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:31,680
it so everybody knows what is the best

1202
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:34,440
way to do it so that therefore the

1203
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:39,618
current user terminals only support to

1204
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:42,950
park a new of Vietnam text course

1205
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:47,250
therefore we need capability negotiation

1206
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:52,379
for telling that we have a capable

1207
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:56,100
multi-party capable terminal and we may

1208
01:02:52,380 --> 01:03:01,480
need to tell which one

1209
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:04,270
the other conference mechanised are

1210
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:07,540
based on centralized the servers where

1211
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:10,000
we have said that we need our turkey so

1212
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:17,620
therefore a centralized conference our

1213
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:20,980
mixing method is needed so what we need

1214
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:22,990
to go from two particular multi pocket

1215
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:27,070
is that we need to identify the source

1216
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:31,470
of text we need receiver to separate

1217
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:35,170
text from different sources and we don't

1218
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:39,750
allow we shouldn't delay the text

1219
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:42,910
presentation should still have the flow

1220
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:47,590
and since there are many implementations

1221
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:50,830
already after doing two party we need to

1222
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:54,310
have a fallback method for mixing when

1223
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:58,060
you have received that is not capable of

1224
01:03:54,310 --> 01:04:02,940
sorting out the receives three in two

1225
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:07,060
separate presentations it's possible

1226
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:11,230
then and there are a couple of different

1227
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:14,380
display types display styles that we

1228
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:18,880
need to have the receiving up to select

1229
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:24,310
between and so which is seen in next

1230
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:27,490
slide one way which I think is becoming

1231
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:32,080
the most common is a view like this

1232
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:36,220
where you labels in front of text chunks

1233
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:40,440
from different parties you see probably

1234
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:45,330
the three lowest icons here you have

1235
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:49,150
people typing so the text is going from

1236
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:51,640
multiple parties in the one you have

1237
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:56,020
completed something that can be called

1238
01:04:51,640 --> 01:05:01,900
the message you let it flow up in the in

1239
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:04,210
the next slide we have another way of

1240
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:07,130
displaying a real context that is to

1241
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:10,640
have a column for each user

1242
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:14,959
the stable place the text in some kind

1243
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:17,839
of relative time holder so lower text is

1244
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:24,578
later Senate's still there is a

1245
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:27,288
requirement to not put every character

1246
01:05:24,579 --> 01:05:29,900
exactly at the time it was displayed it

1247
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:31,880
is a requirement to have chunks of text

1248
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:35,869
readable together so there's no

1249
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:40,809
compromise between time display and the

1250
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:40,809
readability next slide is the

1251
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:49,549
requirements we have is for the

1252
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:52,430
real-time the multi-party you is that it

1253
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:55,400
should be applicable to the 3gpp for

1254
01:05:52,430 --> 01:06:01,479
general sip for engineering mergency

1255
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:05,769
services and services it should not

1256
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:08,868
delay display we have an overall that

1257
01:06:05,769 --> 01:06:15,049
display shouldn't happen not more than

1258
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:17,839
500 milliseconds after sending then we

1259
01:06:15,049 --> 01:06:21,979
also have a slight risk for text loss

1260
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:24,339
when we are redundant same use so and we

1261
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:27,558
have a standard saying how we shall

1262
01:06:24,339 --> 01:06:32,089
indicate that to the receiving user but

1263
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:37,430
the mark in the stream and we need to

1264
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:41,479
have that still available to mark then

1265
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:43,910
and we shall collect text from different

1266
01:06:41,479 --> 01:06:48,439
users so that it's readable and the

1267
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:52,430
source is identified we also support

1268
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:55,549
erasure and that complicates the display

1269
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:59,299
for the multi-party case even must not

1270
01:06:55,549 --> 01:07:06,640
let it erase other parties text for

1271
01:06:59,299 --> 01:07:09,469
example the win it what for security and

1272
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:12,259
we should not have something that is

1273
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:15,339
still complicated there is a some

1274
01:07:12,259 --> 01:07:19,700
urgency for getting this done so

1275
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:24,140
implementable in near future would

1276
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:26,660
current implementations and we need also

1277
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,600
to describe this for back method for

1278
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:35,649
cases when we only have a two-party

1279
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:35,650
capable of receiving terminal mix like

1280
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:57,230
next slide so in the draft I have had a

1281
01:07:53,030 --> 01:08:01,880
draft long time ago which I revived now

1282
01:07:57,230 --> 01:08:05,750
and I did a lot of stuff in then so here

1283
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:08,300
we have right now away is formed as a

1284
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:10,790
kind of discussion paper because there

1285
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:14,860
are many alternative methods that we can

1286
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:20,210
select from for coordination of OTP

1287
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:23,080
based oddity discussed them with pros

1288
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:31,310
and cons and the same thing for web RTC

1289
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:33,830
based streams and then there is a method

1290
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:40,420
be presented for conference unaware

1291
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:42,380
devices and since they're already

1292
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:45,200
implementations out we need to have a

1293
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:48,950
method for capability negotiation for

1294
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:52,639
the multi-party and there are a couple

1295
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:55,609
of methods to select from we need to

1296
01:08:52,640 --> 01:09:01,100
discuss how we identify the source we

1297
01:08:55,609 --> 01:09:03,740
have some presentational aspects we have

1298
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:06,410
the discussion of robustness and the

1299
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:10,250
indication of loss and performance and

1300
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:12,639
security and Ayana considerations next

1301
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:12,640
slide please

1302
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:20,779
so the goers now are to discuss the

1303
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:24,189
different alternative methods for stream

1304
01:09:20,779 --> 01:09:27,319
mixing and source identification and

1305
01:09:24,189 --> 01:09:31,158
grading on preferred methods and then

1306
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:41,080
make that clear in the draft

1307
01:09:31,158 --> 01:09:44,750
and same thing about about the

1308
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:47,870
capability negotiation how to describe

1309
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:50,899
that you have a party that is capable of

1310
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:55,639
this display and agree on preferred

1311
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:57,920
methods for that and then make sure that

1312
01:09:55,639 --> 01:10:03,290
we have a method support back method for

1313
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:07,400
unaware devices now they drove to

1314
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:10,519
touches topics of money working groups

1315
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:15,799
it's for some marketing aspects for a

1316
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:18,650
week or its notion ago she ation for her

1317
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:23,300
music it might be something Pacific or I

1318
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:27,440
don't know and so we need to arrange the

1319
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:29,030
discussions in a practical way I wanted

1320
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,580
to take advice on that

1321
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:34,759
so we have it in a music even if it

1322
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:39,070
touches every key topics or shall they

1323
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:49,880
distribute the discussions let's comment

1324
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:54,139
and that's like is so here are examples

1325
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:57,880
from the draft some discussion topic how

1326
01:10:54,139 --> 01:11:01,780
we coordinate RTP it's different

1327
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:07,550
marketing methods translator or mixer

1328
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:11,420
more have in the source indication in

1329
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:16,449
the stream or have a mesh mesh about the

1330
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:19,400
end points or even multiple RTP sessions

1331
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:22,909
and we also have the discussion on the

1332
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:28,580
conference on the web with agents or we

1333
01:11:22,909 --> 01:11:33,009
provide some sense of multi-party to

1334
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:33,010
them next night please

1335
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:40,650
another discussion topic in the draft is

1336
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:43,410
the capability negotiation where I have

1337
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:48,150
identified three possibilities one is to

1338
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:51,540
somehow make it implicit by saying that

1339
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:56,879
if you have a multi part of our device

1340
01:11:51,540 --> 01:12:01,680
acquiring text in the stream it must be

1341
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:05,730
of course speak markup a party where

1342
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:10,220
also for the text and you can start

1343
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:15,780
sending multi-party contents to it

1344
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:18,870
another is to a new media tag for

1345
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:24,179
declaring multi-party the paper lately

1346
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:27,390
and third one is to have STP media

1347
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:32,250
attribute now there are pros and cons

1348
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:37,490
for this three and mark the other ways

1349
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:42,330
to indicate capability next slide please

1350
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:45,030
so I think guy Jeff is the right place

1351
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:47,070
to do this because we have needs from

1352
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:51,139
different pockets we have Nina and we

1353
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:57,059
have three EPP dollars and they often

1354
01:12:51,140 --> 01:13:00,240
refer to our ITF currently I think it's

1355
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:06,170
a best current practice document should

1356
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:11,460
be produced might be some small

1357
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:19,680
registration of negotiation that needs

1358
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:24,060
to be in standard drop and it is a bit

1359
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:28,110
urgent to get this ready the urgency has

1360
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:31,500
been announced from Nina and the next

1361
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:35,150
generation emergency services so at

1362
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:40,710
least only 2021 that I want to see

1363
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:42,730
implementations running Ollie's and max

1364
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:47,090
like this

1365
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:48,919
which is lost I look forward to rapid

1366
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:52,750
progress on this and hope that we can

1367
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:55,340
get discussions going Thanks

1368
01:13:52,750 --> 01:14:02,000
don't you go any question for

1369
01:13:55,340 --> 01:14:04,400
clarification or anything okay so I

1370
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,410
think we'll have to go and discuss with

1371
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,059
the a dealer to progress it because I'm

1372
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:10,010
not even sure if it's him and music

1373
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:12,530
because it's like it has a spectrum

1374
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:15,770
shape like we said from c4n music and

1375
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:18,410
some abt so typically we do it through

1376
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:21,140
dispatch but then I'll consult with the

1377
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:23,870
with the ad about what to do and we'll

1378
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:25,969
come back and saying how to how we can

1379
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:27,860
progress it and whether it's well and

1380
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:31,179
then we'll have to decide afterwards how

1381
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:33,410
after we decide words it will be

1382
01:14:31,179 --> 01:14:35,210
progress then we'll have to decide then

1383
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:37,070
there will be decision within Swan

1384
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:38,890
document to document or whatever but

1385
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:47,139
first we have to find the home for that

1386
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:47,140
yeah okay I just started with an music

1387
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:56,360
let's see what we're to do it depends on

1388
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:58,989
what solution we do which makes it sort

1389
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,989
of a chicken-and-egg problem

1390
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:08,270
it has topics for a number different

1391
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,719
areas but yeah yeah that'll be no don't

1392
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:21,050
don't select area of the course of how

1393
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:22,820
we selected no it's the solutions okay

1394
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:25,810
this is Barry I wasn't gonna stand up

1395
01:15:22,820 --> 01:15:29,059
yet cuz the chairs had the right idea I

1396
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:32,179
think the abt core chairs near music

1397
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:33,429
chairs should chat first and then go

1398
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:35,960
from there

1399
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:37,820
taking dispatch is a reasonable thing

1400
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,350
but if there are two pretty clear

1401
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:41,509
working groups that it would go in one

1402
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:45,020
or the other and you should work that

1403
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:47,150
out first and if the answer is neither

1404
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:50,750
of them thinks it's the answer is clear

1405
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:52,370
then we'll take it to dispatch or I'll

1406
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:54,050
chat with Adam about it and we'll see

1407
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:55,870
where we go and Magnus obviously has

1408
01:15:54,050 --> 01:16:00,890
something to say so

1409
01:15:55,870 --> 01:16:02,599
so let's see what Magnus has to say so I

1410
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:05,960
actually have a question which I think

1411
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:08,570
defines part of the scope to goon r8 are

1412
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:11,590
you feeling that the multi-stream

1413
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:15,110
multi-part solution is clear for this

1414
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:17,030
that the current payload format UNS use

1415
01:16:15,110 --> 01:16:18,860
it for multi-party with when you

1416
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:21,380
actually have multiple offices are sees

1417
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:27,530
multiple RTP streams is that clear

1418
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:36,920
enough in the specifications sorry we

1419
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:39,230
even if we have so if I mean if I take

1420
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:41,290
the RTP mobile the obvious multi-party

1421
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:44,299
model for real-time text is that each

1422
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:45,950
each you shoulda tried something has its

1423
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:48,440
own as a source II the stream is forward

1424
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:51,590
the whole way to all receivers and and

1425
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:53,210
it becomes solely question of how do you

1426
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:56,540
display these users it's an

1427
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:59,270
implementation it's it static fully

1428
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:02,650
click the right assumption here for what

1429
01:16:59,270 --> 01:17:08,480
you would say be the right solution for

1430
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:10,250
updated users etc and that that would be

1431
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,940
the right and then it's the question of

1432
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:15,230
how do we deal with legacy

1433
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:18,080
implementations that's only assumes

1434
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:22,849
expect one single SSRC when it's deals

1435
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:27,190
with teleport know the my view is that

1436
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:34,850
that would be the ideal solution

1437
01:17:27,190 --> 01:17:41,379
theoretical one SSRC in in one RTP

1438
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:45,110
session one SSRC per sending user

1439
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:49,430
because then you can really identify

1440
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:53,630
where text was lost for example that is

1441
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:57,260
the main problem too if you merge it

1442
01:17:53,630 --> 01:18:03,170
into one stream to know who-who did we

1443
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:06,610
lose text from but I don't want to

1444
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:08,280
complicate implementation because

1445
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:14,240
multiples

1446
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:20,580
SSRC multiple streams seems to be not

1447
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:26,160
supported by STD there are multiple SSR

1448
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:27,960
systems in the same session a lot of

1449
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:30,240
people spective say I know I know the

1450
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:32,130
result is this we get into getting the

1451
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:34,290
whole bundle and multiple and all this

1452
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:37,530
you get a lot of em lines and and which

1453
01:18:34,290 --> 01:18:39,540
which is interesting in these cases

1454
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:43,380
where you have I would say large groups

1455
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:45,960
of conferencing etc and that is using

1456
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:50,130
and I think this is downside of the

1457
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:51,450
result all of so therefore it's an M in

1458
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:53,820
some sense let me use the question of

1459
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:57,000
the complications of using RTP as

1460
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:59,400
intended for this use cases is with Plan

1461
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,840
B in STP years that you get a lot of

1462
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:05,250
ambulance if you have a large number of

1463
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:07,190
potential users you know but okay thank

1464
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:09,360
you

1465
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:12,530
Magnus while you're there do you have a

1466
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:14,820
thought on no okay Magnus is going away

1467
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:27,990
do you have a thought on where it

1468
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:30,360
belongs I so I mean it's this is tough I

1469
01:19:27,990 --> 01:19:33,090
think because some of these solutions to

1470
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:35,370
these legacy problem is is in the space

1471
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:39,120
that you actually or define the internal

1472
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:41,550
of the text formats and and the rest is

1473
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:44,640
very much tingling I think for dealing

1474
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:46,380
with et cetera so it's it's I think

1475
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:50,790
there's a large part which is probably

1476
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:53,520
more Indian music country and then you

1477
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:55,920
have this specific media how to deal in

1478
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,350
media and that's section and I it might

1479
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,690
be that it's small enough and it's not

1480
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:03,630
really changing the RTP stuff anyway

1481
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:05,400
it's something that you could include

1482
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:08,550
their music document and they'll say ok

1483
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:13,740
here is our recommendation and cross lot

1484
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:16,700
working plus call it but that's assuming

1485
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:20,980
one set of implementations of include

1486
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:26,380
how to deal with the legacy cases

1487
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:29,599
for a music it's mainly the negotiation

1488
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:32,900
capability negotiation which way to go

1489
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:42,949
with that shall we add the STP attribute

1490
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:46,570
or is it good with the media her are all

1491
01:20:42,949 --> 01:20:53,678
strong just a word of warning

1492
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:58,540
this is generic multi-party chat service

1493
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,540
we have a long and glorious history

1494
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:07,850
starting with IRC going through XMPP and

1495
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:12,020
various other efforts the fact that this

1496
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:14,690
particular iteration tries to reuse STP

1497
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:16,699
an ar-15 it's more or less an

1498
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:19,428
implementation accident that you will

1499
01:21:16,699 --> 01:21:26,080
talk when the problems of multi-party

1500
01:21:19,429 --> 01:21:33,650
chats and you might want to take a step

1501
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:40,550
back or you might want to shut down the

1502
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:44,570
scope of you so that it's okay to first

1503
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:46,790
you a point solution that you can get to

1504
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:49,099
quickly because you don't consider

1505
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:53,900
consider either other requirements or

1506
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:56,960
other technologies but this is nifty

1507
01:21:53,900 --> 01:22:06,830
party chat it will have all the problems

1508
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:08,750
of trying to say on you had multiple

1509
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:11,059
artists solution architecture in the

1510
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:13,190
document and you have to figure out we

1511
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:15,560
have to figure out which one will be

1512
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:18,290
simple to implement and to start with

1513
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,600
that because I assume maybe when you

1514
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:23,449
having a conference and a conference of

1515
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:25,010
an MCU the does that may make it simple

1516
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:26,690
because signaling would be simple

1517
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:29,300
because like a point-to-point with

1518
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:31,129
handling all the mechanism we have today

1519
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:33,480
to do multiple conferencing like the

1520
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:37,260
focus the one to a defining sync so

1521
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:39,209
we better to look at all each cases and

1522
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:41,100
try to analyze what is needed to

1523
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:52,620
implement these cases whether it's

1524
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:54,240
already supported and we can do it what

1525
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:56,490
I wanted to ask is a qualifying question

1526
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:59,160
is and all of those deployments are they

1527
01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:01,440
real or just purely nothing but text

1528
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,750
well are you sometimes trying to mix the

1529
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,910
text with other media that would be the

1530
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:08,220
only rationale but I could see why you

1531
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:09,900
would go to any kind of Artemia solution

1532
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:12,090
if it's purely text than all these

1533
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:18,960
deployments and no other media type I

1534
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:21,870
think has to be a hack it's an accident

1535
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:28,010
worse than an accident it's a it's a

1536
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:31,320
giant mistake oh yeah I can respond yes

1537
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:39,470
most common is the combination of video

1538
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:39,469
audio and written training here himself

1539
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:52,700
limitations in 3gpp and that is what is

1540
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:52,700
required in the states at least

1541
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:59,760
mentioned video and closed captions as

1542
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:03,180
part of that so the text appears so big

1543
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:06,660
order presses closed caption now but

1544
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:11,060
this is real-time text you see it flows

1545
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:13,710
as no type juice

1546
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:16,260
this is Barry I also want you not to

1547
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:20,030
forget MLS yes which is going on in the

1548
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:20,030
security area right now so there's

1549
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:27,750
Bernard about myself a clarifying

1550
01:24:24,270 --> 01:24:30,360
question I believe this is part of the

1551
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:34,380
next gen 9 1 1 architecture is it not

1552
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:36,780
because as I yeah recall right you can

1553
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:38,310
have real-time text and audio and video

1554
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:40,940
and it can be conferenced that's how the

1555
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:44,640
recording works kind of go for a

1556
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:46,848
conversing so it tip it can include both

1557
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:49,849
audio video

1558
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:52,559
sometimes I understand it a lot of the

1559
01:24:49,849 --> 01:24:54,239
implementer community would net needs us

1560
01:24:52,559 --> 01:24:55,799
as participating in Rob it's that

1561
01:24:54,239 --> 01:25:00,419
correct so we probably should make sure

1562
01:24:55,799 --> 01:25:04,109
that Rama's in the loop for this that's

1563
01:25:00,419 --> 01:25:06,989
kind of a distinct but related scenario

1564
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:10,679
it may it may be the VRS or it may just

1565
01:25:06,989 --> 01:25:13,768
be a 9-1-1 call the point is that gets

1566
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:16,159
the the root of really user equipment is

1567
01:25:13,769 --> 01:25:18,419
probably also often going to be used for

1568
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:21,089
real-time text and one of the use cases

1569
01:25:18,419 --> 01:25:26,249
you need is a conference real-time text

1570
01:25:21,089 --> 01:25:29,729
to a from a row to a piece app yeah

1571
01:25:26,249 --> 01:25:33,119
right Ruby yeah yes and in that

1572
01:25:29,729 --> 01:25:36,929
situation it is because the piece app

1573
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:40,228
wants to conference in next party in

1574
01:25:36,929 --> 01:25:42,629
their code first the piece up handles

1575
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:44,789
the call and then they want to link in

1576
01:25:42,629 --> 01:25:46,559
another person but still be on the call

1577
01:25:44,789 --> 01:25:50,249
and therefore it gives the conference

1578
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:54,709
called a simple three party or in most

1579
01:25:50,249 --> 01:26:03,719
cases and the user part might be a

1580
01:25:54,709 --> 01:26:07,079
mobile terminal so IMS um yes I mean I

1581
01:26:03,719 --> 01:26:09,719
can just I mean which I guess that might

1582
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:12,659
quite there is that what's what

1583
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:16,409
implement solution spaces are likely to

1584
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:18,858
be easy for that community depends yeah

1585
01:26:16,409 --> 01:26:20,719
that effects what what we choose to do

1586
01:26:18,859 --> 01:26:25,079
yes

1587
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:26,669
yeah so I think it does sort of seem

1588
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:32,688
like people are feeling this is more in

1589
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:38,039
my scope with M music than here so I

1590
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:40,649
mean we should presumably talk music did

1591
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:48,719
meet this time that we have to talk

1592
01:26:40,649 --> 01:26:52,780
I did I didn't see them I mean I didn't

1593
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:56,590
see the chest the chairs are both

1594
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:58,300
Fleming angry yeah pretty sure he's not

1595
01:26:56,590 --> 01:27:00,429
not haven't seen bow around and I don't

1596
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:02,260
know whether he's not to also yeah so

1597
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:12,400
both of them are not here so we have to

1598
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:15,849
do it some mosquito kuzmic so we will

1599
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:17,920
connect also with the music chairs and I

1600
01:27:15,849 --> 01:27:19,989
think that the good thing what what you

1601
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:23,110
need to be done is to try to focus on

1602
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:26,289
what solution you really think will be

1603
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:29,860
the best fit for being able to progress

1604
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:32,230
it faster and try to try to see how to

1605
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:34,030
do them but from a standardization point

1606
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:36,730
of view and from something the

1607
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:37,800
implementation community can do without

1608
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:45,159
too much pain

1609
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:50,889
you know that's good summary thank you

1610
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:53,259
okay thank you thank you okay but so I

1611
01:27:50,889 --> 01:27:56,289
think like this we finished the agenda

1612
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:59,670
for today anybody have any other

1613
01:27:56,289 --> 01:28:02,949
business they wanted to bring up today

1614
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:05,800
otherwise this is the last session of

1615
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:10,629
the ITF so Wes you're an ad welcome to

1616
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:13,619
the end of the ITF otherwise and see you

1617
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:13,619
all in Vancouver
