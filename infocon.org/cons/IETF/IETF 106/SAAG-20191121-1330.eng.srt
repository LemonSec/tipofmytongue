1
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:11,240
well update him for the proceedings

2
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,850
hello everyone and welcome to sag

3
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,870
welcome back from lunch my name is Roman

4
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,510
Jeanne Leo and I am Ben Caidic and we

5
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:42,120
should try that not be throwing things

6
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,829
and hitting each other so we got the

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,370
blue sheets going around and Roman

8
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:53,370
already got us the jabber scribe and the

9
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:55,468
minute taker so we will get started this

10
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,550
is no well he's noted well if you have

11
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,399
not already noted it well not too much

12
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,390
on the agenda today just the usual weird

13
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,850
reports and then the open mic the slides

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,829
we have are made as of 119 this

15
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,630
afternoon so 11 minutes ago so if you

16
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,070
have sent something in the last 11

17
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:21,658
minutes it will not be reflected in

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:24,630
these slides so I guess we should just

19
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,039
page through these slowly and if someone

20
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,939
has further comments that they want to

21
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:32,119
mention we can just bring those up to

22
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,119
Mike

23
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:47,540
lamps we get a report for lamps

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:06,570
so I have my co-chair said he would send

25
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:09,630
this surprised the group is moving along

26
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,570
pretty quickly we have I think three or

27
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,370
four documents with the isg right now we

28
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,640
have a recharter that should be on the

29
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,800
next LH at if that happens then we have

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:27,390
a whole bunch work that will be up for

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:32,780
adoption anything exciting going on for

32
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,779
MLS I'll just see you on Friday

33
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:45,390
anything you say about the first meeting

34
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:47,910
of OAuth happened okay

35
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,589
so I can add an OAuth we had the related

36
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,350
TX off both which we're going to talk

37
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,000
about and then there has been talk about

38
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:56,000
something dumped off 2.1

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,180
anything happened in TLS before lunch uh

40
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,400
yeah we there were presentations on some

41
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,960
ongoing working group documents delegate

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,850
credentials exported authenticators and

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,470
then we had some new work on batch

44
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,700
signing compact II uh since I'm he said

45
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,820
act if you helmet and I just sent the

46
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,899
report they're just good to go so and

47
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,630
then we're gonna be talking about yes

48
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,540
Annihilator today so yeah we had a lot

49
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:43,359
of talk about external PS case as well

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:46,120
no yes thank you so we had two baths in

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,380
the security area we had math math mesh

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,670
and we also have TX auth so folks want

53
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,340
to say anything relative to the math

54
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,989
mesh Baath the kind of the summary was

55
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,700
we heard about a broad area of

56
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,880
technologies we heard about one

57
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,709
particular application domain there was

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,359
not a lot of excitement about that

59
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,640
particular application domain but we

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,040
talked about others and there was

61
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,750
interest in following up on some of the

62
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,920
specific kind of technology issues and

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:21,100
that was the next step coming out of

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:24,510
that loss so TX off do teachers want to

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,510
say anything since there was no report

66
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:37,020
actually did send out a report but

67
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:39,760
anyway so we had a presentation of all

68
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,169
like protocol which is not

69
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:48,370
backward-compatible with oauth2 and

70
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:51,120
addresses a few more use cases and has a

71
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:55,420
different flow than today's all still

72
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,780
there was agreement over all across the

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:02,980
room about the problems

74
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:06,609
there's no no agreement on a way forward

75
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:09,490
yet as you mentioned there's discussion

76
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,130
at the same time about an oath to

77
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:17,380
rewrite tentatively named their two

78
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:21,280
point one as well as this O three

79
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:23,080
this is being hashed out as we speak so

80
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,840
I think there also may be a few side

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:31,289
meanings in this general space did

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,289
anyone go to those that is here

83
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:44,020
look excites I was at a off-site meeting

84
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:46,540
that mostly disgusts off 2.1 or

85
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,060
continued the discussion of off to that

86
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,030
one from the ORS

87
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,180
first off meeting was it mostly just

88
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,690
discussion or any any good conclusions

89
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:01,440
well someone volunteered to do some work

90
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:05,110
but I can't recall the name right now

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,630
Aram I could could be but that let him

92
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:17,169
confirm that's hopefully they remember

93
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:19,180
that they signed up to do the work okay

94
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,310
so there is a lot of other security work

95
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,960
that's happening across the IETF we have

96
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,330
a scattershot of some of them both in

97
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,840
the working groups in the IRT F in the

98
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,240
IAB

99
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,619
and through liaison activities so if

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,990
anyone wants to come up to the mic now

101
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:44,620
to describe some of that please please

102
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:49,860
do so I guess when we're making the

103
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:52,510
slides I put him up here we've got some

104
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,500
some cootie related work going on there

105
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:58,630
talking about like the autonomic network

106
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,970
infrastructure and the security

107
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,770
protocols and security secure

108
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,800
communications mesh for that and so they

109
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,419
want to use x.509 certificates to

110
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,640
authenticate all the nodes in the sort

111
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,930
of autonomic network and I've been

112
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,390
having a little bit of a back-and-forth

113
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,310
with the authors about how exactly

114
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,650
they're going to use the x.509

115
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,030
certificates because they have some

116
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,159
information that they want to put in the

117
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,299
RFC 82 name field of the certificate and

118
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,710
I'm not I'm having a hard time

119
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,240
convincing myself that this is like

120
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,159
within the spirit of

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,789
x.509 so I've I think I've talked to a

122
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,800
few people in person about this but

123
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:39,610
they've got in addition to like IP

124
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,460
address in string form they have the

125
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,770
sort of name of the acp domain in the

126
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,780
you know domain part of the a 22 name

127
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,560
but then there's some some other stuff

128
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:53,440
as well including like a arbitrary

129
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,840
subdomain name and a whole form or

130
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,219
extensions and it's it's a little bit

131
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,530
weird to be constructing your own

132
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:03,400
structured name within the constraints

133
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:07,599
of the a.22 name at least to me so

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,698
anybody who is interested in thinking

135
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,759
about this a bit more I'd be happy to

136
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:16,180
talk to you at some point not

137
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,409
necessarily now and get a actual

138
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:23,440
resolution for them because I don't want

139
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:27,460
to keep holding a discus forever thank

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,319
you for the open mic yeah all right so

141
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,649
um

142
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:36,579
you asked about possible stuff in the

143
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:39,339
security area so the UT a working group

144
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:43,598
hasn't met for awhile and there is like

145
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:45,130
the old stuff to clear up but we had a

146
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,200
couple of a couple of us had a

147
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:54,189
discussion in a break whether it's time

148
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,790
to do a BCP on deployment experience

149
00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:00,700
from 103 or if it's too soon is there

150
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,520
stuff you know that should get out there

151
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,470
in terms of like that kind of the kind

152
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,380
of stuff that we put in in the BCP for

153
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,050
1.2 that's an open question for the

154
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,850
community yeah I think I'd started

155
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,459
talking to the TLS chairs a little bit

156
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,720
about that and you know there's maybe

157
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:21,689
some work to do in the space about

158
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:25,660
updating our recommendations like a

159
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:30,339
cretin is a PCP 210 195 I don't remember

160
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:33,850
the RSC 75252 you include to us we're

161
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:37,810
not three in those recommendations but I

162
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,100
think we and you Chris and Joe and Shawn

163
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,800
you can correct me if I'm wrong but I

164
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,760
think we decided that we will

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,729
but more to get a little bit more

166
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,029
deployment experience maybe some more

167
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,709
specific experience with Xero RTT before

168
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:52,180
we start doing that right that was gonna

169
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,979
be my photo of question whether that's

170
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,410
gonna be the focus maybe it may be it

171
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,110
will be right but anyway I guess the

172
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,569
working group will hibernate for a while

173
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,010
and you know see if some something else

174
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,459
turns up I don't think so but I think

175
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:08,019
we'll wait for for you guys to tell us

176
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:10,930
when it's time to wake up and do some

177
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:15,399
work okay or we could like close and

178
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:18,069
retire it depending on Bob Moss would

179
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:22,029
say she consulting you have TMR ID up

180
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:24,910
there the decision seems to be to move

181
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,560
forward to a working group for TMR d

182
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,260
we're now we're here in the scope of the

183
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,029
other charter of interest to the stag

184
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:37,269
group would be Graf Whitaker tiem Rd I'm

185
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:39,850
off and Adam has an interesting spelling

186
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,769
of Whitaker so I suggest you look at the

187
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,510
boss information to get the proper

188
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:46,300
spelling to find the draft the reason I

189
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,970
mention it is that one of the things

190
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,719
that we have to struggle with is

191
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,570
authenticating these really short

192
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,360
messages previously sent which we hash

193
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:58,170
and then include the hashes in the auth

194
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,329
message which is then signed so

195
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,279
discussion on what we have created there

196
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,979
the first set of thoughts we have on

197
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,500
that we're really open to other ideas

198
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,540
and thoughts are working this extremely

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,520
constrained environment and how to

200
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:17,529
authenticate 25 byte messages and and to

201
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,529
prove the owner of which actually you a

202
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,270
sent those messages by hashing them and

203
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:26,050
including them in the much longer auth

204
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:28,540
message so a bunch of other eyes on that

205
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,630
draft are greatly appreciated the draft

206
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,719
is really rough right now but really

207
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:38,019
appreciate assistance on that one and

208
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,490
Bob do you know maybe send that to the

209
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:44,890
email lists as well I will send that to

210
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:47,130
the sackless yes just a quick note since

211
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:50,350
you do have NTP up there we did submit

212
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:53,620
NTS to the is G so hopefully that's

213
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,240
almost done and we have adopted two

214
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,950
additional drafts that are

215
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,770
related to security one on rough time

216
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,750
and one on Chronos so those are security

217
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,180
related items that are going on in the

218
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,560
NTP working group thank you

219
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,540
I also put up there the IAB not program

220
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,729
so just IAB activity for the threat

221
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,899
model discussion I know Stephen or yari

222
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,899
do you want to say anything about that

223
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:40,910
yah react so there's been some amount of

224
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:42,829
activity on that so we Stephen I emerged

225
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,379
our draft we're still working on through

226
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:48,290
the other feedback that we've gotten and

227
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:50,449
at this idea we had a site meeting 22

228
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,949
people attended and it seems like there

229
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:56,618
was quite a bit of interest and some set

230
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:00,769
of people willing to contribute

231
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:03,980
different aspects of the topic and so

232
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:06,649
we're cranking away I think and gets the

233
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,139
overall plan is that we will provide

234
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:11,259
some documentation and rationale for you

235
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:15,439
know why why are we in this situation

236
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:16,999
essentially I guess because we've made

237
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,849
some progress in terms of communication

238
00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:20,989
security and now some of the threats our

239
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,629
that we have to worry about are the

240
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:27,199
remaining ones and that's why the focus

241
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:28,730
has has changed and you know isn't this

242
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,639
sort of supporting documentation we'd

243
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,230
like to get sort of one pager that that

244
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,980
is you know this is how we would like to

245
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:39,709
change our see 3552 it's uh at least my

246
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,779
interpretation of the of the situation

247
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:44,118
but war continues yeah I think that was

248
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:46,669
my interpretation as well that we if

249
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:49,989
everything goes well end up with like a

250
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:52,069
one page update to 3552 for the

251
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:53,299
broadened scope of things that we have

252
00:13:52,069 --> 00:14:02,179
to think about because we've been doing

253
00:13:53,299 --> 00:14:05,419
so well encrypting everything okay other

254
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:09,019
security updates from other working

255
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:12,249
groups inside and outside the idea going

256
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:15,259
once twice

257
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:17,360
okay so with that we're gonna open up

258
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:20,049
the mic line is there anything someone

259
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,049
would like to talk about

260
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,100
we could have had a longer lunch I guess

261
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,620
all right well we're not gonna wait for

262
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:49,040
them okay going once going twice

263
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,540
anyone want to come up to the mic all

264
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,079
right in that case we're gonna call it

265
