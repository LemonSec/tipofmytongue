bit on the late side of things the room

8
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,460
is in a hard place to find so we're

9
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,460

okay let's us that is get started

14
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:39,479
welcome to BFD i'm jeff has Rashad is

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,889
unable to co-chair for this session

16
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,919
because he is unable to make it the

17
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:46,260

[Music]

22
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:56,460
Shaw Amin has agreed to take notes so

23
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,840
that I can pay attention to the session

24
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,909
as you notice I have a few things

25
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:05,549
operate here we have four sessions today

26
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:19,320
you know covering this of course the

27
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:20,669
guys on me screen okay so quick agenda

28
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,680
we're going to go through a chairs

29
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:27,000
update got to go through BFD 4vx LAN EFT

30
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,410
for large packets both of these have

31
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,169
been through we're can go at group last

32
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:35,070
call and we were supposed to have a

33
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:37,830
presentation on one-armed BFD is there

34
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:43,159
one of the document authors in the room

35
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:43,159
to present that okay thank you

36
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,039
so document status

37
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,130
BFD 4vx LAN had a working group last

38
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,500
call it created a lot of discussion over

39
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:59,190
300 messages which is very unusual for

40
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,919
DFT hopefully we got over the majority

41
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,880
the the discussion I believe it is Greg

42
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,609
that will actually be giving the

43
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,900
presentation on the current status of

44
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,270
things second item is we also try to

45
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,580
work in group last calling VFD for large

46
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,490
packets this actually prompted some

47
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,979
discussion that had been stalled out and

48
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:23,310
we need to get some revisions for that

49
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:26,789
I'll be covering that without wearing my

50
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,490
chairs had to uh for this purpose as

51
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:32,190
part of working on BFD unsolicited a

52
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:35,160
minor change was discovered to be needed

53
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:39,479
made at the last second in the BFD yang

54
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,159
module Rashad has asked the RFC editor

55
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,810
for procedure for taking care of that

56
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,110
and that should actually be in

57
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,260
progress once we clear that point that

58
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,450
will clear a yang dr. comment on the VFD

59
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,099
unsolicited draft and I believe that

60
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,880
will be finished with working group last

61
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,950
call we have a little bit of an

62
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,650
interesting situation for the VFD

63
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,169
authentication documents it's a series

64
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,310
of three of them one of them has IPR on

65
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:11,010
them that has generated some discussion

66
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,900
during IETF 105 you know we put forth to

67
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,180
the group that we believe the documents

68
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,870
are at this point in a technically

69
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,360
viable and the complete standpoint no

70
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,650
further technical commentary was given

71
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,060
on them we also asked if they this

72
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,150
working group would be willing to allow

73
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,460
these to proceed it is perfectly

74
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,209
allowable for IETF to have documents

75
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:40,289
that have IPR in them the IPR holder in

76
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:44,839
this case Siena noted that their IPR is

77
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:47,490
no more restrictive than other IETF BFD

78
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:51,900
IPR including my employer juniper who

79
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:57,300
which is at IPR an RFC 58 84 BFD itself

80
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:59,520
I spend a little bit time in the working

81
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,020
group discussion there was a small

82
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:06,180
amount of show for taking the documents

83
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,670
forward it was not a huge list of the

84
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,969
group so we have some small support I

85
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,650
believe Greg's objections still stand so

86
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,730
that's at least no one public no

87
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,860
requests not to I've been spending a

88
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,870
little bit of a ITF trying to discuss

89
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:27,180
with the people about our consensus

90
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:29,459
process with regard to this the general

91
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,459
outcome of that discussion is that the

92
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,640
main consideration ITF has for

93
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:38,339
intellectual property restrictions and

94
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,580
documents is there implement ability so

95
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,320
if the IPR would prevent somebody from

96
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,880
actually being able to implement it

97
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,900
that's the main consideration this sense

98
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,670
that has been given from the

99
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,829
intellectual property holders is that

100
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,339
they would offer licensing for it

101
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,050
and that it could be carried forward

102
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,120
they declined to state to know whether

103
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,219
if he may actually be judged though so

104
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,319
implementations such as Linux which need

105
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,110
to be open source and free may

106
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:09,349
potentially be encumbered so this

107
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:13,139
remains somewhat of an open discussion

108
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:18,689
based on what my process discussions and

109
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:20,430
then we have no weak but positive force

110
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:23,009
to actually take the documents and

111
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,029
submit them to RFC that we'll be

112
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,519
spending the next several days

113
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,290
concluding discussions with people is G

114
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:31,050
and otherwise to see what the process

115
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,998
looks like and I will take back to the

116
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:40,139
mailing list what the process looks like

117
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:43,589
for that the FT v2 and other extending

118
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:46,290
DFT discussions the ITF 105 discussion

119
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,749
was actually very positive we did have a

120
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,969
number of people working on various

121
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:55,050
timing things especially from the IPP

122
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:57,540
I'm a related group group documents they

123
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,899
did that personally find PFD a good fit

124
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,759
for encapsulating their stuff the

125
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,240
general feel of the discussion had been

126
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,490
to not overload BFD v1 which is you know

127
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,670
gotten significant traction within the

128
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,649
industry for providing connectivity

129
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:15,689
verification and that you don't overload

130
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:19,439
it make it more difficult for it to do

131
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:21,800
its core job was there room to leverage

132
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:24,509
BF PPD use and procedure which is the

133
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,680
motivation we seem to be seeing for

134
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:31,910
putting additional information in to BFD

135
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,290
for different things including Oh a.m.

136
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,689
there seems to be some level of positive

137
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,929
discussion on that I need to find a way

138
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:43,079
to generate a discussion with enough of

139
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:46,920
the isg to figure out how we want to

140
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,628
target such a thing if at all because by

141
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,699
expanding the scope of what it carries

142
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:53,759
and who gets to use it we potentially

143
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:55,079
have this work leaf BFD as being the

144
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,160
working group we're effectively giving

145
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:01,290
IETF a gift of a state machine and past

146
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,050
that point how ITF chooses the use it is

147
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,699
part of the Charter discussion martin

148
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:09,279
did you care to say anything on this at

149
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:11,139
this point or okay

150
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,110
okay so well we'll continue this

151
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,490
discussion with the IHG offline and

152
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,410
hopefully we'll have some level of

153
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,660
traction on this point now for the

154
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,660
upcoming IETF 107

155
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:50,750
is Greg I think and the clicker as usual

156
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:58,140
does not seem to be working okay so as

157
00:12:50,750 --> 00:13:04,470
Jeff explained this captures the updates

158
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:08,790
that were applied from the last meeting

159
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:12,090
to before this meeting resulting from

160
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:14,490
addressing some of the Directorate

161
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,940
comments and the discussion that we had

162
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,990
from only with experts in vehicle and so

163
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:26,280
the discussion were more related to VX

164
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:30,180
LAN environment and what is allowed and

165
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:36,720
how VX them is used rather than just to

166
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:42,150
base B of the machinery one of the

167
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,580
questions comments that we received in

168
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,850
the working group or just past working

169
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,510
group or school was the question of why

170
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,480
and whether there was sufficient

171
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:56,370
discussion of the working group of

172
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,890
making the statement in the document

173
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:05,220
that if the echo is outside the scope of

174
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:09,540
this specification so the chairs made

175
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:15,839
another call to the working group asking

176
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:17,459
for consideration and comments and to

177
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,260
the best of my recollection there were

178
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:24,870
no comments so I believe that based on

179
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,410
where the Cho's concluded that working

180
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,740
group is agreeing with a statement that

181
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:34,079
B of the echo is outside the scope so

182
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:37,760
which means that if somebody wants to do

183
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,589
that there will be another specification

184
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,850
but this specification does not address

185
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,579
any aspects of

186
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,309
using beef da commode over the excellent

187
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:50,709
though yes technically that's pro that's

188
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:56,410
possible because it's considered to be a

189
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:59,018
single IP hop we had a lot of discussion

190
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,049
on selection and use of destination mac

191
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:06,509
in the inner Ethernet header and IP

192
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:06,509
destination address in the inner

193
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:15,758
encapsulation you know your IP header

194
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:19,329
also we discussed their number of DVDs

195
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:26,829
sessions between the pair of this two V

196
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:30,160
tabs and what what is management via ni

197
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:34,319
and how it can be used for BFD over the

198
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:38,079
X line next

199
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:40,719
so yes the destination MAC address

200
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:47,909
question was raised in routing

201
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:55,439
directorate review and it suggested that

202
00:15:47,909 --> 00:16:00,669
use of some MAC address is intrusion on

203
00:15:55,439 --> 00:16:05,799
tenants MAC address space and thus it's

204
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:09,579
not allowed in the X lab but we did

205
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:13,619
receive actually we had a proposal

206
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:17,529
originally at some point is that to use

207
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:20,259
allocated by Jana MAC address so since

208
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,159
then in a discussion we decided now we

209
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:30,579
leave this out we will move this from

210
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:33,399
the document we formulated this

211
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:35,709
following text and this is a quote from

212
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:39,220
their current version of the document

213
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:41,439
mr. nation Mac this must not be one of

214
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,539
the tenants MAC addresses the

215
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:46,059
destination MAC address may be the

216
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:48,819
address associated with a destination V

217
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:51,509
tab the MAC address may be configured or

218
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:54,128
it may be learned the control plane

219
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:56,209
protocol details of how the MAC address

220
00:16:54,129 --> 00:17:03,350
is obtained outside the scope of the

221
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:08,119
document further and this discussion is

222
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:12,049
not yet closed because we Furr recommend

223
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:16,010
to use loopback one of the loopback IP

224
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:23,720
addresses whether for ipv4 range or v6

225
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:27,230
and we leave MAC address for this

226
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,049
destination IP address basically

227
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:35,110
pointing to this text so we had a we

228
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:38,570
have unresolved common proposal to use

229
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,969
to define some default MAC address that

230
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:45,350
will be used if the destination IP

231
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:48,830
addresses it look back in my opinion and

232
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:53,449
I talked with Santosh about it so like

233
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:57,168
an active editors of the draft that it

234
00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:00,320
still goes back to the dedicated MAC

235
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:03,529
address even to the more limited scope

236
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:08,529
applicability so which probably we don't

237
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:12,020
want to do yes problems some

238
00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:15,950
implementations of VX LAN that look only

239
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,918
at their destination MAC address of an

240
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:23,980
inner header and then might not look an

241
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,980
IT payload there might be a problem

242
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:27,760
so I

243
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:37,489
heard from the author of this proposal

244
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:39,710
that he is okay with the current text so

245
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,020
in my opinion this proposal still stands

246
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:48,820
and I think that it's up to the working

247
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:52,220
group to decide how to handle it further

248
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:56,270
so what we are stating is and again this

249
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,190
quote from the current version we

250
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,040
thought must validate the packet in the

251
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,080
destination mac a of the inner internet

252
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,720
frame matches one of the MAC addresses

253
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,780
associated with the Vita the packet must

254
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,179
be processed further if the destination

255
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,940
MAC of the inner Ethernet frame does not

256
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:15,440
match of the he taps MAC addresses then

257
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,150
the processing of the receive a

258
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,130
excellent packet must follow the

259
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,630
procedures described in a vehicle and

260
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:26,380
RFC if the B of this session is using

261
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,750
the management vni and we have

262
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,970
discussion in a section 6 a Big D

263
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,690
control packet with unknown MAC address

264
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:41,620
might not be must not before we go to VM

265
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:44,540
because just it's not bomb procedure I

266
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,760
think that there is agreement with this

267
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:54,530
text there is no common statistics okay

268
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:57,440
next please now on IP address because we

269
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,330
had a lot of good input from people from

270
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,650
you know with existing implementations

271
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:06,919
of the FD over VX LAN the following

272
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:10,340
statement users should not must even

273
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:15,380
though elders of the document were quite

274
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:18,949
inclined to use must here so you can see

275
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:23,900
it says should use one of the loopback

276
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:27,650
I knew that will happen should will use

277
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:30,800
one of the loop addresses and again that

278
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:34,250
is because we were told that there are

279
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:38,629
implementations that hard-coded using

280
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,130
different than that and will not told

281
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,880
that they can be configured for

282
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,880
something else

283
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,380
so Matthew Bakke Nokia so in the past

284
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:52,070
when we've sort of tunnel to BFD we've

285
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:56,049
always said it - unto serpents - I would

286
00:20:52,070 --> 00:21:01,780
say even more generic when we do any IP

287
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:05,900
or a.m. over the tunnel we use look back

288
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:08,510
and it's sweeping or and BFD actually

289
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,110
BFD followed the same because the first

290
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:15,320
one it was

291
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:19,158
RFC 43 79 which changed the new back in

292
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,928
another FC thing 1122 and that was for a

293
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,789
pretty good reason I think with

294
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:25,100
something to do with if it gets

295
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,289
extracted at the wrong part along the

296
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,908
place or own path so don't forward it so

297
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:31,730
you can't use it as an attack vector and

298
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:33,860
right absolutely yes I mean yeah

299
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,900
and we've also I've also come across

300
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,520
sort of interoperability issues with

301
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:41,780
things like early implementations of

302
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,030
seamless BFD and LSP PFD where people

303
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:47,870
have sort of some implementations will

304
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:50,210
check for one to 7/8 some won't and some

305
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:54,080
will discard if it's not one to 7/8 and

306
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,870
I'm just worried that if you're if

307
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,820
you're implementing this on a box that's

308
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,850
also doing all sorts of other flavors of

309
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,710
BFD they're going to run into issues if

310
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:09,799
you allow anything other than one - 7/8

311
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:13,809
again my understanding is that this is

312
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,809
something that working group can decide

313
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,720
so speaking personally rather than as a

314
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,950
chair I think we all agree that if

315
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,559
you're writing this from scratch and you

316
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,799
had a clean implementation the procedure

317
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,080
here is the right thing to do and the

318
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,820
proper thing likely to do is an industry

319
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,830
is just simply to pressure people to

320
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,689
conform with this certainly you know you

321
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:37,399
as an implementer have that choice

322
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,659
simply by making sure that your stuff

323
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:45,500
doesn't interoperate with things you

324
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:47,860
consider broken I don't know if there's

325
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,860
some way of

326
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:01,060
Matthew you're suggesting that we should

327
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:07,260
have must in place of the ocean

328
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:07,260
Oh personally I'd rather do that yeah

329
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:15,010
could you at least write down so not

330
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:17,200
envy you're speaking sorry could you at

331
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:22,270
least write down what on the risk of not

332
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:24,190
respecting that truth are you asking him

333
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,870
to basically rewrite the reason why

334
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,410
forty three seventy nine says did not do

335
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,120
this yeah may be appropriate to put a

336
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:36,220
reference and as to why for you three

337
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:38,290
something I did okay that'll be easy

338
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:42,610
maybe in the security consideration

339
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:47,889
section right something to say I think I

340
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:52,360
think that we had more extended text why

341
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:53,290
we said T Tier one but yeah that would

342
00:23:52,360 --> 00:24:03,370
be not a problem

343
00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:05,680
absolutely okay so should we take it as

344
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,699
a working of decision or it will go to

345
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,470
the mailing list

346
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,840
I think documenting the security

347
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:15,220
considerations just yeah no but changing

348
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:18,340
to must because I think that yeah

349
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,740
documenting its informational part but I

350
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,679
think that more important is changing

351
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,780
shoot the most is the implementer that

352
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,740
does this willing to identify themselves

353
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:31,960
I can dig through the email but we can

354
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:36,010
just announce it and just wait for

355
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:39,250
people to scream yeah so the motivation

356
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,660
to force the change you know just simply

357
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,670
say you know you have to be compliant is

358
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,010
that we want to make them do things as

359
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,410
best I remember the working group

360
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,420
discussion we have currently two parties

361
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,800
that actually implement this so we have

362
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:52,600
enough that verify that people can

363
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,110
actually do things in an interoperable

364
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,730
fashion the problem with taking your the

365
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,000
implementations is people are taking the

366
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,440
risks to help refine the technology and

367
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,700
you know there's some expectation that

368
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,970
they eventually become conformer at the

369
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,970
documents but there's all

370
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,919
so a desire in their part that by our

371
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,419
taking of the process we don't force

372
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,169
them in the position that they regret

373
00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:16,190
actually doing things early so the

374
00:25:15,169 --> 00:25:18,020
question becomes what level of

375
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,970
disincentive are we providing might know

376
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:23,000
making them an informant and then you

377
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,090
know documenting that we're gonna break

378
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,669
their inter up by Fiat I think it

379
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,370
depends how widely deployed though

380
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:32,809
that's my question so let me stick an

381
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,289
arbitrary name in there that I do not

382
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:37,730
believe is the party but no FEX LAN is

383
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:40,220
VMware is actually one that did this and

384
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,440
you tell them well you can't do that and

385
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,909
they're not conformant how many people

386
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,830
you think are good right implementations

387
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:48,260
that actually no take care then yeah

388
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:52,879
actually since we have one of the

389
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:56,030
editors familiar with their what they

390
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,480
concern are the appeal the explain is

391
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,730
not their concern anymore because they

392
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:07,010
transition to another and gets a overlay

393
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:09,429
protocol but they still allows out there

394
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,929
it's gonna ever e ones gonna have to

395
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:14,690
accept packets that have been on one to

396
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:16,700
seven /i yeah typically the way we see

397
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,409
most of these implementations behaving

398
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,720
is people will throw in a knob to turn

399
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,460
on non compliant mode for Reuters and as

400
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,260
long as the default discovered by the

401
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,000
should you know it takes care both the

402
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,679
security considerations and now you

403
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,919
basically have an implementation knob of

404
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:35,270
last resort it's ugly

405
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:38,450
it's just what's common practice its

406
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:45,770
ugly in a headache and that development

407
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:48,350
and testing and okay yeah I think they

408
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:53,090
know what if our normative dictionary

409
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:56,959
does not have strongly recommend for so

410
00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:00,408
we have on me must and shed which is

411
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,549
recommend where should not yes but its I

412
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:08,480
should not rather must not be yeah we or

413
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:11,900
we can do double negative so what we're

414
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,710
gonna do it at this point so we forget

415
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:17,780
about existing we ignore their pain or

416
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,760
we'll just

417
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,550
I I think the discussion that we've had

418
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,020
you know across that 300 messages I

419
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:27,950
think that was almost so many of the

420
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,510
messages yeah and my feeling of the

421
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,660
consensus for the conversation is the

422
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:34,220
should gets the feature out there it

423
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,550
encourages people to do the right thing

424
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,380
and implementers that choose not to

425
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:43,270
interoperate with them have the option

426
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:46,250
to do so okay okay so then we just add

427
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:48,800
text to security consideration

428
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:53,060
explaining the choice and probably

429
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:56,389
pretty much cut and paste text from for

430
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:58,040
the first 79 or 80 delicious tonight yes

431
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,920
and if we wish to be religious in there

432
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,409
we could also add in a sentence saying

433
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,180
that implementations that previously did

434
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,900
this for early deployment purposes

435
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:11,290
really should capital and I said Shane

436
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,290
yes

437
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:17,440
tell people to do the right thing okay

438
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:20,389
these sessions in management via night

439
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,230
so the current version stress is that in

440
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:26,930
most use cases single this session

441
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:29,540
between two V taps is sufficient to

442
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:34,640
monitor continuity of their V excellent

443
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:37,820
uh no but we do recognize that there

444
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:44,330
might be cases when operator would like

445
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:51,620
to do monitoring via nine and then there

446
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:57,350
are free to choose that also what we

447
00:28:51,620 --> 00:29:00,320
introduced is that operator may

448
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:04,030
designate one of the vni that doesn't

449
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,580
have any tenant as management CNI and

450
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:10,790
then use this via an eye to monitor we

451
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,970
excellent tunnel we refer to this as a

452
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:17,889
management via nice similar to

453
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:23,900
management VLAN but we do not specify

454
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:27,890
which then I number should be used

455
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:30,130
we just indicate that we use V ni number

456
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,050
one

457
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,710
we had some discussion some people

458
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:38,889
suggested to use VMI number zero but we

459
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:41,830
were informed that there are some cargo

460
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:47,580
and some other considerations that might

461
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:52,600
limit the use of va0 so we decided to

462
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:55,840
not recommend semillas remain as a

463
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,600
default value for management which

464
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,179
actually elders discussion led me to

465
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,139
think and something that probably we

466
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:08,110
should can discuss with the NGO 3 group

467
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:11,290
is do we want to have for the sake of

468
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:14,050
Geneva document as well the document

469
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:23,020
which discusses use of management via

470
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:24,430
NIU extent I think yes for sure I mean

471
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,260
this is you know end up being very

472
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:30,400
similar I would think between yes

473
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:33,070
because that was again I kind of can see

474
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,570
this same discussion like this same text

475
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:38,129
being repeated so probably better to

476
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:43,300
have some document which makes it more

477
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:45,110
deterministic okay so we probably will

478
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,379
get to that later

479
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,149
[Music]

480
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:54,130
open ish questions yes we do have some

481
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:58,960
open questions and again as I mentioned

482
00:30:54,130 --> 00:31:02,260
already earlier we do have proposal to

483
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,350
have some default value for the MAC

484
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:11,290
address in case that management Vienna

485
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:14,980
is used for BFD session so in a small

486
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:20,770
text underneath if you see that yes they

487
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:25,870
say it simplifies configuration but at

488
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:29,800
the same time in my opinion it goes back

489
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,300
to their allocated number so my

490
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,940
impression from the text is that we go

491
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:39,010
back to an IETF allocated number here

492
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:41,230
and this almost is a request to mvo 3 to

493
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,710
designate this number in that new

494
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,500
management dock

495
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,000
management instance document that this

496
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,409
is the MAC address that it should get by

497
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,520
default if it doesn't otherwise choose

498
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:56,409
one is that a valid interpretation there

499
00:31:52,520 --> 00:32:03,049
was no suggestion because actually

500
00:31:56,409 --> 00:32:05,799
future work on management document we

501
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:08,059
haven't got any further rather than

502
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:14,929
realization that yeah and then might be

503
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:18,020
a good community service so again I

504
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:22,159
understand their interest and rationale

505
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:26,570
of having some well-known default Mecca

506
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,240
address here again it's limited because

507
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:36,439
the proposal is that to use this number

508
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:44,559
only if its management via ni but at the

509
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:49,429
same time so it's the same whether it's

510
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,500
anyway can intrude on a tenant space so

511
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:56,029
because what guarantees that tenants

512
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:59,539
would not allocate something randomly so

513
00:32:56,029 --> 00:33:04,190
my personal impression for this is that

514
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:06,860
we likely should not ask IANA for a

515
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,770
specific address that it is reasonable

516
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:12,229
for this current version of the document

517
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:15,770
that we're trying to RFC to say that a

518
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:20,140
number should be used supplied by the

519
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:23,899
user if we do actually end up with a

520
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:28,490
management instance document for mvo 3

521
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:31,279
it is not unreasonable to ask that

522
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,919
document to potentially update this RFC

523
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,659
does imply this as a default so this is

524
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,179
sort of a backdoor way to maybe add it

525
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:41,299
at a later point if this is a thing that

526
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:42,590
nvo three wishes to do but if you don't

527
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,360
have a well known MAC address aren't you

528
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,918
asking every implemented a configurable

529
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,620
knob for the foreign MAC address

530
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,940
absolutely mm-hmm and if it does make it

531
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:54,889
very clumsy because I

532
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,750
I can't I think we had discussions

533
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,330
similar to this with some other forms of

534
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,880
REM in MPLS TP and and people just push

535
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,060
back and push back and said we do really

536
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,410
don't have that sort of configuration

537
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:14,029
well it could be configuration with the

538
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:17,570
control plane this is a closed control

539
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:20,000
plane this is yeah this is a kind of

540
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:22,070
discussion for a PFD we're defining the

541
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,199
protocol mechanism the bootstrapping of

542
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:26,420
this is going to probably go on top of

543
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:30,290
something else

544
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:34,940
actually I do favor proposal that Jeff

545
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:38,600
made because the document which is more

546
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:43,520
generic and will address the management

547
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:47,239
vni for all overlay protocols and will

548
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:50,300
set for all other protocols rather than

549
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,770
BFD so if we define it here that will be

550
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,050
the wrong place because it will be a

551
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:56,330
limited or might be viewed only as

552
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:59,030
applicable to BFD I think it should be

553
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:03,980
applicable to all communication between

554
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:07,730
V taps because management Vee and I is a

555
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:10,730
control and signaling channel between V

556
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:15,380
taps so any communication between them

557
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:18,250
over this channel should be using if we

558
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:27,770
decide should be using this MAC address

559
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:34,130
including Beauty okay so let's take that

560
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:36,800
forward so okay then the proposal or

561
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:43,070
this okay is a proposal decision that

562
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:47,300
will not address this request in this

563
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:49,130
document that I think that is the

564
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,900
reasonable thing to do that's the

565
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,020
consensus we currently have from the

566
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,510
mail discussion we provided a possible

567
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:58,520
path that allows us to add it after the

568
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,740
fact updating other RFC's is a

569
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,210
reasonable thing to do and this means

570
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,560
that we can unblock this document

571
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,660
through the RFC Q and

572
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,910
depending on exactly how much work there

573
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,950
is to do in nvo 3 for such a management

574
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:15,839
document maybe that comes out much

575
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:19,649
faster than this okay let's let's make a

576
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,680
chase ah fine strong the normative for

577
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:30,930
the years of Vietnam 1 so basically a

578
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:33,240
change from May to recommendation again

579
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:36,569
this is open question to their working

580
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:44,669
group many pointed out that the fact

581
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:48,180
that VLAN 1 is my understanding defect a

582
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:51,720
standard management real and again I

583
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:55,009
couldn't find any normative reference to

584
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,350
the deal and one being management VLAN

585
00:36:55,010 --> 00:37:04,500
but in my firm my experiences yes that's

586
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:08,339
usually what being configured so I as an

587
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:14,310
editor or with a Santosh too so we think

588
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:20,760
that the current text is reasonable so

589
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:25,470
again no action here ok good

590
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,820
and last actually it was question almost

591
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:31,709
at the 11th hour from Santosh himself so

592
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,010
the main mode is not mentioned in a

593
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:36,990
document explicitly and is it indication

594
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:41,490
that it's outside the scope of the draft

595
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:43,859
and if it's outside the scope the draft

596
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:47,520
should we have the same statement

597
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,940
similar to in regard to be of the eco

598
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,940
mode so for PFD eco mode the

599
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,640
consideration is traffic that needs to

600
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,110
be encapsulated outside the protocol so

601
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,440
that's the reason why it has to be

602
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:02,640
explicitly set outside because we have

603
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,280
to have the discussion but the fording

604
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,020
for such echo packets would look like

605
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:11,280
for demand mode being on top of a sink

606
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:15,030
it's a bass note that band is part of 58

607
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,920
80 this core feature it unless there is

608
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,240
a reason we think that it breaks for

609
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,910
some strange reason

610
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,169
in this environment then we don't need

611
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:26,660
to mention it because it's just a

612
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,660
supported feature okay

613
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:35,900
okay being pedantic do you think that we

614
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:39,480
need to have some clarification to that

615
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,700
along the line that you just reaction

616
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:46,080
you just leave it as is just leave it as

617
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:51,899
is okay perfect okay

618
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:55,650
and with that I think that we have one

619
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:59,310
action point to the editors at the text

620
00:38:55,650 --> 00:39:01,140
which is pretty clear and then for the

621
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:04,140
working group chairs to decide what we

622
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,589
do Thanks so we've completed working

623
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:09,690
group last call we've gotten substantial

624
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,520
feedback the amount of text change as

625
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,040
part of the feedback has been relatively

626
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,190
small so what that means is because they

627
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,140
converge on those points mostly talked

628
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:22,140
you know we achieve consensus which is

629
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:24,660
all we can do so once you've added the

630
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:26,580
other item we can each take a quick

631
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,368
editor editors pass through things but

632
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:31,890
the written request call has concluded

633
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:36,090
and once we have the new version we all

634
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:41,430
advanced it to the ISG okay when we have

635
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:50,880
a game review and comments asking I'm

636
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:53,250
not asking okay so okay in the meantime

637
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,740
so we'll get to our action point and

638
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,800
we'll report when it's ready okay thank

639
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,799
you

640
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:09,730
so this will be a very brief update and

641
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:13,419
BFD for large packets and I'm speaking

642
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:19,480
in the context of a contributor rather

643
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:22,660
than his grip and grip chair so a very

644
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,790
very brief update your requested working

645
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,629
group last call for version 1 because we

646
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,490
thought it was done

647
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,800
didn't no see any additional things need

648
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,990
to be added and as is often the case

649
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,869
than IETF this scared people into

650
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:40,089
looking at the draft we've got a lot of

651
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:41,859
feedback I think less ginsberg the

652
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:44,140
points that we addressed from that

653
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:46,420
feedback in draft oh - which is

654
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,310
currently published is there's more

655
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,070
operational discussion about detecting

656
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:53,529
MTU mismatches there's more discussion

657
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:57,240
about ecmp impacts that when I think

658
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:57,240
particular came from Robert rush book

659
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,970
one of the open items have text written

660
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:06,040
is still discussion about how this

661
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:08,740
operates with regards to SPF t

662
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,900
procedures where the reflector basically

663
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:13,060
is a passive entity in most cases do we

664
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,520
want to make sure that it reflects a

665
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:18,190
specific MTU or no could be choose to

666
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,520
screeners that each so we're going to

667
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,020
address that as part of oh three we did

668
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,480
not specifically make any protocol

669
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:28,690
changes as part of the o2 considerations

670
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,030
notice mostly operational ones the o3

671
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:34,089
ones will be minor protocol discussions

672
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:38,589
for SPF D but again the main procedures

673
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:39,940
themselves shall not be altered so since

674
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:42,549
we believe that we may have addressed

675
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:46,510
all the operational considerations that

676
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:47,950
were brought up will request that the

677
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:51,250
working group last call you know be

678
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:53,529
reviewed for the o3 version and then

679
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:56,079
we'll see about advancing that based on

680
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:59,170
that as mentioned in Prior presentations

681
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,349
we do have Interop between doe juniper

682
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:06,970
equipment and some software beta stacks

683
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:09,480
and seems to work perfectly fine any

684
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,480
questions

685
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:22,400
okay our next presentation is and the

686
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:25,700
one-armed PFD use case so who has not

687
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,240
signed the blue sheets everybody assign

688
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:33,200
the blue sheets yes okay please advance

689
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:36,310
blue sheets the middle of the room if

690
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:39,169
you could take the microphone here

691
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:41,180
please I know who you are

692
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:45,230
yeah that's thinking maybe five minutes

693
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,910
is enough and then this is a very sorry

694
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:51,680
would you please stay for the microphone

695
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:56,270
your name how about this you know your

696
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,759
valium who are you okay okay so good

697
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:04,190
afternoon my name is a we charge him

698
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:12,650
from China Mobile and this use case we

699
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:20,090
just we just use it in our data center

700
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:23,150
network you know next page okay okay so

701
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:27,890
the application scenario is very simple

702
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:33,740
because when we deploy is a data center

703
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:37,700
maybe we did not open PFD but in some

704
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:43,549
applicants now such as if we want to use

705
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:46,730
data center for our telecom we life that

706
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:50,030
means something like that we call the

707
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:57,020
telecom craft at that appears general we

708
00:43:50,030 --> 00:44:03,140
need improve the availability of the

709
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:09,590
data center so we hope to rise PFD

710
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:13,910
between the Gateway and the NIC over the

711
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:17,720
V at that applicants narrow because of

712
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:21,379
you know it's very hard for the neke to

713
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:27,399
support the PFD protocol so we won

714
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:33,160
to use something like the ico motor to

715
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:40,880
run the PFD functions in the it wayside

716
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:45,950
we run the PFD protocol and give the

717
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:51,500
destination MAC address to the NIC but

718
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:57,919
as the IP address to itself you know

719
00:44:51,500 --> 00:45:04,010
that is overly network and the the axle

720
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:08,420
I'm will for the PFD packet to the NIC

721
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:13,660
directly and when the NIC received the

722
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:19,960
packet eight got the IP address and

723
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:26,569
rotated back to the Gateway so that in

724
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:30,650
the the this application scenario no PFD

725
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:36,020
Reister unique and the we still can use

726
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:42,650
PFD to monitor the link is quality so

727
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:48,080
next page so we compile in this opinion

728
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:50,780
scenario and the function to the current

729
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:55,840
a PFD I've seen we found the a ttle the

730
00:45:50,780 --> 00:46:00,950
IQ function is used on two systems that

731
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:04,730
deployed of PFD but our applicant

732
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:06,950
scenario as I just mentioned in the

733
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:13,280
other side there's no PFD riced

734
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:20,960
and the next page we also see the PPF a

735
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:27,190
TR 146 and it gives some description I

736
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:32,030
think it's a similar to the current FC

737
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:34,079
so it's also not gives a clear

738
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:39,799
description

739
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:45,660
if the post cited the system need a

740
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:48,569
recipe FD together can next page so the

741
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:51,808
the the the question for us is that has

742
00:46:48,569 --> 00:46:55,410
does echo function require remote peer

743
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:58,950
note to support PFD protocol it seems

744
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:03,980
like it's not a clear in current I've

745
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:08,520
seen as well as the current PB -

746
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:11,880
document so the other question is that

747
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:16,440
whether that's something else needed to

748
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:23,480
be considered with ICO dinero's such as

749
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:29,970
a PFD armado so our next step our

750
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:36,089
proposed is that it might be modify the

751
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:41,299
current I've seen to clarify the PFD I

752
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:45,078
call functions oh maybe we can give an

753
00:47:41,299 --> 00:47:52,079
informational drafter to describe the

754
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:55,319
PFD functions at the scenario I just

755
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,619
mentioned so that's how thank you okay

756
00:47:55,319 --> 00:48:05,040
so I will start speaking if I'm too fast

757
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:07,380
feel free to ask me to slow down about

758
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,900
four years ago I think maybe a little

759
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,900
bit longer I started receiving strange

760
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:15,839
emails at work asking about running PFD

761
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:19,049
with echo without actually having the

762
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:22,650
EFD protocol adduce know this seemed

763
00:48:19,049 --> 00:48:25,259
like a very strange sinner to me and i

764
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:29,849
couldn't figure out what the request

765
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:32,160
actually was when you look at what was

766
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:35,430
actually requested for support from the

767
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,368
routers and from the hosts really they

768
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:41,089
asked for packet loopback for if the

769
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:44,220
echo port to actually be enabled and

770
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:46,609
it's like okay I understand this is not

771
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:50,509
a bad way to test whether

772
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:54,109
not you have remote connectivity but

773
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:56,210
when there is no BFT protocol involved

774
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:58,578
there is nothing for me FTE necessarily

775
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:02,660
to standardize so I didn't understand

776
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:06,289
the nature of the question and then a

777
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:09,890
little over a year ago somebody may be

778
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:13,130
aware of the broadband forum PR 146

779
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:15,940
document and this gave me why people are

780
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:19,339
asking about it it was because another

781
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,470
standards organization had decided that

782
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:24,410
they were going to try to make use of a

783
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:30,319
small piece of our functionality but in

784
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:32,899
a way that was not well specified there

785
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:38,509
their document has errors in it this is

786
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:42,109
an understood thing and it is as you say

787
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:45,619
one-sided or one-armed you know that the

788
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:48,259
protocol literally is from if these

789
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:50,779
perspective shut off you know what we

790
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:52,670
have is effectively some switch that we

791
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:55,130
turn on you know the echo functioning

792
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:58,700
regardless of whether or not BFD has

793
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:01,549
been negotiated so we're sort of using a

794
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:04,848
piece of the VFD machinery and we

795
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:09,099
certainly could use the piece of a VFD

796
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:12,319
echo implementation that understands no

797
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:15,259
interruptions to loop that things are up

798
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,769
or things are down and report it to a

799
00:50:15,259 --> 00:50:22,400
client protocol so certainly somebody's

800
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:24,618
BFD implementation could be let's call

801
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,210
it broken in this way so that this

802
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:31,670
functionality was took effect where the

803
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:34,039
discussion is interesting so you're

804
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:39,529
you're the first to bring this to IETF

805
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:41,569
to ask about this BBF has not come to a

806
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:44,660
TF I found out about this completely by

807
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:48,529
accident and as I mentioned their

808
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:52,609
document is not quite right and one of

809
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:55,430
junipers members of BBF has said that

810
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:57,578
they may write a updated version of the

811
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:59,009
document at a later point in time

812
00:50:57,579 --> 00:51:02,460
where this lis

813
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:06,360
us is an interesting position of ITF

814
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:08,940
does not describe this behavior ebf has

815
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:12,150
some description of the behavior but

816
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:16,380
it's not correctly described the

817
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:19,080
functionality is useful but EFT as a

818
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,570
protocol itself is not actually active

819
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:24,450
on this session so to some extent we're

820
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:30,180
describing how a broken BFD could be

821
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:33,710
used so our problem is IETF is do we

822
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:36,569
wish to put a document together that

823
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:39,360
effectively republishes the scenario

824
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:46,410
from BB F maybe with Corrections and at

825
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:49,290
the IETF context part of that is having

826
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:52,020
a discussion with Martin or ad to figure

827
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:55,350
out if this fits into the Charter part

828
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:57,330
of the discussion is discussion with you

829
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:59,100
know any of the Hazen's we may have with

830
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,509
broadband form to figure out you know

831
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,930
why did you use our protocol in the

832
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:06,420
first place without talking to us but

833
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:08,430
but I think that the point you're

834
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,460
bringing to the working group and thank

835
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:15,029
you for the presentation is that this is

836
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:17,160
a helpful piece of functionality and you

837
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:20,520
also gave an example of could we maybe

838
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:24,440
extend yang to cover this behavior so

839
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:28,009
that such things could be configured so

840
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:30,150
there is possibility for the work

841
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:32,460
certainly if you wish to be one of the

842
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:35,490
authors on the document towards IETF

843
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,740
that can be done but there are many

844
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:41,850
process discussions that have to happen

845
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:44,160
first no problem I think it's a will be

846
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:47,430
very useful because the currently a lot

847
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:52,319
of overly networking is a deployment

848
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:56,520
that deployed that not only within data

849
00:52:52,320 --> 00:53:01,320
centers such as the vxy as well as you

850
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:05,070
know one system in sd1 especially for

851
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:08,460
some industry in tonight so maybe the

852
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:11,380
scanner function can be used in more

853
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:14,440
application scenario so that's useful

854
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,720
and we have I think two open questions

855
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:21,520
that make this potentially a little more

856
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:24,520
difficult no the first observation is

857
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,200
that ITF has sometimes republished

858
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,350
another doc and other working groups

859
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:32,740
sorry another standards bodies document

860
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:34,420
in an IETF context is narf see sometimes

861
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:37,140
that's actually a handover where we take

862
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,760
over a maintenance of work for them

863
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:42,879
the issue that we do have to verify

864
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,420
before we can start to progress is since

865
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,300
BBF is a standards body do they have an

866
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,810
intellectual property restriction on

867
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:54,850
their proposal so even if we wanted to

868
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:57,040
do work on this we would have to figure

869
00:53:54,850 --> 00:54:02,350
out the status of that the start yeah

870
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:07,620
but that I think a BFD rised up by ppi

871
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:12,310
the IDF and as you could IDF is a host

872
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:16,150
observe the FDA so I personally agree

873
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:19,090
with you however lawyers do not have a

874
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:23,080
larger question I think yeah okay that's

875
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:25,840
Wes Ginsburg I just this is kind of

876
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:28,569
interesting the what I'm wondering about

877
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,780
the interactions with the various forms

878
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:35,890
of strictmode I think that would be

879
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:37,810
problematic cuz millions actually have a

880
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:42,640
BFD session and particularly you don't

881
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:44,710
have BFD at all on the pier yeah the

882
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,190
sort of weird observation I've made as

883
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:50,440
this has come up yeah my job over the

884
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:53,020
prior years is that they're using the

885
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,000
FDA echo packets through the job and if

886
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:57,190
I have to take a guess as an engineer

887
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,260
there's probably some sort of no

888
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,600
commodities silicon vendor that happens

889
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:02,800
to have the FDA code loopback programmed

890
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,220
into their hardware that makes this

891
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:10,270
cheap and easy and people are just using

892
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:12,250
that but this could be ping you know

893
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:14,140
literally any mechanism could be used

894
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:17,740
that tests the remote connectivity and

895
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:21,390
you know the DFT state machinery for

896
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:24,368
clients could be used echo it back

897
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:29,890
actually

898
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:34,460
thanks to bringing this Terra 146

899
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:39,259
attention I was not aware of it and when

900
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:42,730
I read it I believe they do use not only

901
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:47,440
beef the echo the use a combination of

902
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:51,890
pole sequence to communicate diagonals

903
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:55,540
and and actually that's where I found mo

904
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:58,460
more mistakes and error misconceptions

905
00:55:55,540 --> 00:56:01,730
and no reference to the final for

906
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:04,670
example they just say we send a reply

907
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:07,010
which is not accurate terminal it is

908
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:10,630
terminology I can understand what they

909
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:18,500
mean but the technology as well so I

910
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:21,260
think that again we have this week

911
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:24,319
David Sinha crop so if we want to

912
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:28,280
communicate something to be there that

913
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:31,279
he can put on the liaison head and we

914
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:35,900
can use that and actually the good thing

915
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,869
is that PDF member meeting is one week

916
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:41,240
from this week I believe it was David

917
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:43,700
that brought 146 to my attention the

918
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,649
first time okay actually I would be

919
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:51,339
surprised because when I mentioned to

920
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:55,640
him he gave me this stare look that okay

921
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:59,480
might be at some time back he knew about

922
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:01,730
it it was either David or one of

923
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:05,660
Jennifers internal people well could

924
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:09,040
have been David Dave Allen yes yes

925
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:18,348
because actually it's out of his in the

926
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:21,170
old working area okay so Martin from

927
00:57:18,349 --> 00:57:23,510
hobby so I think this idea is very

928
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:26,510
interesting as in it's very useful offer

929
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:29,869
some scenario in my personal opinion I

930
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:32,720
think there may be some protocol work

931
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:36,079
need to be defined in this little girl

932
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,450
because for the traditional BFD session

933
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,440
we need to set

934
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:43,990
to set it I only need to set our my

935
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,530
discriminators right which we use

936
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:51,368
particle tuner this come in turn off the

937
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,790
remote side but for this one called one

938
00:57:51,369 --> 00:57:55,510
arm

939
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:59,250
VFP we need to suppose so there may be

940
00:57:55,510 --> 00:58:02,200
some different some different work

941
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:05,170
particle process need to be done for

942
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:07,509
this solution so based on my

943
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:10,859
understanding talking to people who seem

944
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:13,690
to have some flavor that's implemented

945
00:58:10,859 --> 00:58:16,900
the whole issue here is that they don't

946
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:18,760
want to put any BFD machinery into the

947
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,320
effectively it's a host device at the

948
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,750
other site like a media gateway for

949
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,720
cable networks that sort of thing very

950
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:28,000
dumb boxes and they're relying on the

951
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:31,689
packet loop to simply fulfill the need

952
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,910
so this is very bad from the working

953
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:38,320
groups perspective because we don't have

954
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:41,740
any negotiation that can help the BFD

955
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:45,119
sender figure out what's no packet speed

956
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:47,890
the receiver actually wants to get so

957
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,660
this this is probably okay for the

958
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,549
people who did this work because for

959
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,810
their environment they knew what speed

960
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:55,030
they're willing to support it's either

961
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:57,670
very slow or they they know how fast

962
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:59,290
they can safely know do things you're

963
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:01,599
absolutely correct that if you're trying

964
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:04,029
to do this in a safe fashion you would

965
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:06,700
be using a full BFD implementation that

966
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:08,650
it's only purpose is to say I'm not

967
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,230
willing to do fast they sink I'm gonna

968
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:13,780
go into demand mode immediately feel

969
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:15,970
free to use echo you would get the same

970
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:17,650
profile but to do so you would actually

971
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,430
need to have enough of a PFD

972
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:25,750
implementation from the state machine

973
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:27,879
yeah I think yeah yeah for that attacked

974
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:30,160
I think a great weights you know need

975
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,230
some particle extinction because the

976
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,819
local site and remote side but for the

977
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:38,109
local process and based on current

978
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:39,700
precision I think her name is some

979
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:41,980
modification to the current process into

980
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:45,339
you know how to handle this you know

981
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:47,980
have the same discriminate no maybe

982
00:59:45,339 --> 00:59:50,650
no no discriminators remember this is

983
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:57,730
echo and it's literally just IP packets

984
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:59,769
this is a very dumb mechanism yeah kind

985
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:01,119
of echoing yourself in a way I mean the

986
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:03,220
thing that springs to mind with this is

987
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,769
there's another power mechanism could

988
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,538
LSP self ping where you just root you

989
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:09,399
just flip the packet you just address a

990
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:15,039
packet yourself and send it into an LSP

991
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:17,349
and it comes back yeah kind of yeah so

992
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,579
I'm wondering about the the negotiation

993
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:20,319
you're talking about is really you know

994
01:00:18,579 --> 01:00:23,589
negotiating with yourself because it's

995
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,279
just a rout yeah you're just a syndicate

996
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:27,130
our turn

997
01:00:24,279 --> 01:00:33,279
you know because of the remote side and

998
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:36,670
that cannot that is very weak system and

999
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:39,390
that but it can rot back as a packet so

1000
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:44,170
maybe we can use a priority lose speed

1001
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:47,249
be a fanny pack a treat but we can check

1002
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:50,470
the linkers quality that's enough and

1003
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:53,589
then calling it a DFT packet is a little

1004
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:56,410
misleading it's if the echo packets are

1005
01:00:53,589 --> 01:01:01,509
just data it just happens to be to a

1006
01:00:56,410 --> 01:01:05,049
well known port Lewis Chan one direction

1007
01:01:01,509 --> 01:01:06,609
maybe from the echo sigh is Marie now

1008
01:01:05,049 --> 01:01:07,630
actually do not be quite a coup start to

1009
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:10,150
do anything right

1010
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:12,160
so therefore actually for

1011
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:14,769
troubleshooting I also thought some

1012
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,649
other statistic collections right we may

1013
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:20,738
specify the format so that the echo size

1014
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:23,440
can optionally okay turn on to get the

1015
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:25,269
statistics so that the troubleshoot to

1016
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,700
look at what happened in the networks

1017
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:30,189
and look how many sections we adapt ish

1018
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,839
so those whole thing may be useful in

1019
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:33,609
some places actually

1020
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,349
but we need to identify who are the

1021
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:37,210
sender I think that is the important

1022
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:38,890
which is the exterminator always knows

1023
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:42,880
information and that another packet

1024
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:46,299
itself actually I think that this

1025
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:49,799
exchange brings for a good question that

1026
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:52,779
was somewhere in the back of my mind is

1027
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:55,779
would be good in this document even when

1028
01:01:52,779 --> 01:02:00,009
we write it that explain what exactly

1029
01:01:55,779 --> 01:02:02,550
can be verified and monitored using this

1030
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:05,820
technique so

1031
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:09,300
that to have right expectations and I

1032
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:13,050
want to point out that echo works on the

1033
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:16,650
over single hop you know okay so it

1034
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:20,130
could be at uh no so but you're still

1035
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:22,320
crossing single hawk right yeah

1036
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:25,530
and relaying a question from Robert

1037
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,540
Russia and Jabbar was a spoofy

1038
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:31,050
projection spoofing protection

1039
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:32,820
considered in this Eco mode and you know

1040
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:35,400
Greg you just answered a portion of the

1041
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,900
question which is that it's single hop

1042
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:41,490
only you know whether it's a tunnel or

1043
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:44,910
not but beyond that this is just a echo

1044
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:47,609
functionality and you know the remote

1045
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:50,520
side exercises no protocol behaviors at

1046
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:52,800
all so it is up to the sender to put

1047
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:56,180
something into the packet that they

1048
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:59,960
would recognize

1049
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:02,120
you know the BFD 58 80 spec does not

1050
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,830
talk about that at all it's my

1051
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:06,529
impression from having talked to other

1052
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:08,330
implementers that sometimes they'll put

1053
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:11,120
their proprietary stuff in there that

1054
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:12,529
does attempt to look for it they're not

1055
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,990
going to publicly say what they do

1056
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:16,970
that's that you can fire up tcp dump and

1057
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:20,750
no look at it and you'll probably give a

1058
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:23,060
guess on it you know okay thank you

1059
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:25,010
thank you so I think the actions for the

1060
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:27,170
working group is no rules continued

1061
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:29,360
discussion the mailing list will discuss

1062
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,950
things with the BBF and figure out how

1063
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:34,810
to take this forward okay

1064
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:37,339
thank you and that concludes our content

1065
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:40,759
we will probably be meeting is

1066
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:45,070
competitive upcoming IETF and you know

1067
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:45,070
thank you for coming to IETF for 1:06

1068
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:09,250
they never describe why they call the

1069
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:12,730
DFT

1070
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:12,730
but 46 5
