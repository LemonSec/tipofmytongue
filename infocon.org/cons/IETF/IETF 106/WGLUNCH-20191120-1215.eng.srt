1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:14,480
excuse me hello hey I was just trying to

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:22,250
get folks at

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:23,990
sorry alright it is twelve sixteen so it

4
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,579
is time to start the working group tears

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,150
you want to go back to the top just to

6
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:31,670
do the oh yeah okay that one you don't

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,620
need the next one no well this is still

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,690
IETF so we do need to pay attention to

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:40,540
that the next one is the agenda for

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:42,949
today we might be doing a tiny bit of

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,960
shuffling oh no we're not going to

12
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:47,329
shuffle the agenda so this is the agenda

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,059
that we have for today the most

14
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:55,090
important part is the session on the

15
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:58,339
consensus so that is where we will go we

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,840
do have a jabber room sometimes it's a

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,250
little bit confusing whether we do or

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,320
not but we do actually have a jabber

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,710
room it's WT chairs and with that we

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,639
will move

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:12,020
is there any agenda bashing nope okay

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,990
excellent so the first thing I'd like to

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:35,419
do is to have Jay introduce himself come

24
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:38,889
on up hello everybody so my name is Jay

25
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,209
Daly I'm the new ITF executive director

26
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,369
I've been in the job about four weeks

27
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:46,640
now so apologies if I don't know all of

28
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:48,590
your names yet I'll be making that same

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,619
apology in about two years time I'm sure

30
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,539
but if there's any of you that I can

31
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:58,369
continue to say hello to please just

32
00:01:53,539 --> 00:02:02,149
wave and I'll come and meet the as you

33
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:05,780
know the I work for the ITF LLC which is

34
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:07,940
a reasonably new construct and my role

35
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,788
is new as well so I'm still working out

36
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,290
exactly what I meant to do if any of you

37
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:14,690
can help me on that then I very much

38
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,310
appreciate it plenty of people are

39
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,349
willing to tell me what I can't do but

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:25,069
in things that I can do I'd love to hear

41
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:27,890
about so I'm here I think as certainly

42
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,140
to manage certain aspects such as Khan

43
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,790
tracts and fundraising and other things

44
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,708
and I've just sent out an announcement

45
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,480
now about another contract we've signed

46
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,100
but there are plenty and other broader

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,450
things I think we'll be looking at as

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,920
well so if you want to find me then you

49
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,970
have my email addresses please let me

50
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,179
know

51
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,709
I live in possibly the furthest country

52
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,690
in the world from any of the rest of you

53
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,700
in New Zealand so if you're on your way

54
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,800
to Antarctica you can always stop in and

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,280
say hello but it's generally friendly

56
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,930
time hours for many people so I'm here

57
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,300
I'm available please get in touch if you

58
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,070
don't like speak about anything any

59
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,070
questions or anything now otherwise

60
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:17,660
great thank you Thank You Jay all right

61
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,820
so next up on the agenda is is Pete I

62
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,549
have also been informed that the jabber

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,579
room that's pointed to from data tracker

64
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,070
is actually the edge you jabber room but

65
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,390
there is a WG chairs one so I would use

66
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:34,010
that one if you don't mind being a team

67
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:38,350
instead of a working group always means

68
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,350
that the data trackers a little bit odd

69
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:52,070
hi oh so this is a work in progress I

70
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,950
hope we can do this more than once and

71
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:59,120
add to it and that the conversation

72
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,700
helps with this so up front these are my

73
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,140
opinions not IETF dictum as if we ever

74
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,600
have anything like that but RFC 72 82 is

75
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:13,880
a consensus document - albeit

76
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:15,320
informational and not BCP and a lot of

77
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,779
the stuff that I'm going to be talking

78
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,539
about has been quite effective chairing

79
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,640
and useful so I hope it's useful to you

80
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,789
as well

81
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:31,159
Wow doing this with bifocals is really

82
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:34,729
interesting also note that this is part

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:40,400
of sort of a bigger picture project on

84
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:41,760
helping chairs do their jobs so most of

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,320
us are engineers not

86
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:49,349
by trade managing volunteers isn't even

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,820
like managing folks in corporate

88
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,940
settings so it's even more complicated

89
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:55,890
than that and I know that Alissa has

90
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,950
been looking for different ways to get

91
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:00,570
chairs training on dealing with working

92
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,159
groups and and so we should be seeing

93
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:06,270
more of that going forward this is just

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,370
a piece so let's talk about consensus

95
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,940
just at the top level by the way just so

96
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,920
we get nice arm exercise in who has read

97
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,300
and feels like they get a you know

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:22,830
general picture from 70 to 80 - oh good

99
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:25,050
that's nice to see okay so remember

100
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,800
consensus is a means to an end we don't

101
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,840
do consensus just cause it's fun to hum

102
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,270
what we're doing here is technical work

103
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,599
and it is in fact the case that some

104
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,180
choices are worse than others so we want

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,670
to make sure that we hear all voices in

106
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,590
the room or all voices on the mailing

107
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,720
list because it might be the case that

108
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,940
one person has the right answer and we

109
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,360
all go oh man of course that's the right

110
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,390
answer

111
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,040
and just doing a vote isn't a helpful

112
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:58,979
way to find that out we also want to

113
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,590
minimize some of the bad things that can

114
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:04,320
happen in standards organizations by way

115
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,270
of politicking so packing votes with

116
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,670
people who don't know what's going on

117
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,310
making bad compromises all of those

118
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,220
things and 70 to 80 to talks a bit about

119
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:18,180
all those bad outcomes and why doing

120
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,520
consensus helps avoid those things rough

121
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,920
consensus doing rough consensus instead

122
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,080
of full consensus is so that we can deal

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,830
with the fact of actual engineering

124
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,169
compromises full consensus can go on

125
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,020
forever you should ask John Levine for

126
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:37,800
interesting stories I believe his

127
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:40,200
partner is a member of the the friends

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,880
Society and how they can go on for years

129
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,450
and years with single decisions it's

130
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,100
loads of fun for engineering we need

131
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,700
things to complete in finite time that

132
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:53,880
would be good engineering is never going

133
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,500
to be a perfect choice we do need to

134
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,840
make compromises we do need

135
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,030
to balance risks and rewards with

136
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,500
certain engineering choices and so

137
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:06,780
sometimes a desire of one person is

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,020
going to be superseded by we got to get

139
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,330
this done and we got to make a choice

140
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,969
finally we eventually do need to say

141
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,550
yeah we get it but we're gonna take that

142
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,200
risk and go in a different direction and

143
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:24,870
rough consensus allows us to do that so

144
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,849
that all out of the way one of the

145
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,970
things that I've been pushing is that

146
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:33,600
doing rough consensus means that chairs

147
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:37,070
need to take responsibility chairs ADEs

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,919
whoever's in leadership you have a real

149
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:44,099
serious responsibility that you've got

150
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,289
to take up in that position as a chair

151
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,840
you've got to be able to decide that

152
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:51,810
somebody's in the rough you've got to

153
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,289
make the call that yeah I've heard it

154
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:58,140
I've heard the room and yeah we get that

155
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:03,020
you object but you're in the rough part

156
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:06,240
of that consensus you need to be able to

157
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,430
notice when people are just coming in

158
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,870
the room to pack the vote and aren't

159
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,990
bringing anything additional to the

160
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,660
table that whole section at the end of

161
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,890
70 to 80 to about five people four and a

162
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,850
hundred people against could be

163
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:23,450
consensus or could be rough consensus

164
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:27,840
exceedingly controversial and it's

165
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:30,570
absolutely the most absurd example of

166
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,059
what could happen but it's theoretically

167
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,429
one of the things we're trying to avoid

168
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,739
is packing the room with a bunch of

169
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:41,489
people just to say no doesn't mean no

170
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,360
and it's a good tool to make sure that

171
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,620
we're making a good engineering choice

172
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,750
so you've got to be able to identify

173
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,910
that and got to be able to push back on

174
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,280
that and if it really was five four and

175
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:56,459
a hundred against I doubt any of us us

176
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,740
in this room could actually pull off the

177
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,200
the task of saying look the five people

178
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:05,400
get it but you should be aware that

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,890
that's a tool that's available you've

180
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,329
got to be able to for purposes of

181
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,619
discussion put your own

182
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:16,859
an aside you've gotta be to the room to

183
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:20,489
your working group a neutral arbiter

184
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,529
that doesn't mean that anybody expects

185
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:24,480
you to be tabula rasa I was just talking

186
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:26,670
to someone earlier today that we do this

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,610
thing of with my hat on with my hat off

188
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,878
and with my hat off doesn't mean I'm not

189
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:36,259
taking that into account it can't you

190
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,879
are that person what it means is I'm

191
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,249
admitting that I've got this bias but

192
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:45,269
I'm going to try my best not to engage

193
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:47,850
in it okay you're not saying that you

194
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:52,589
have removed your brain you're just

195
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:55,949
saying that I'm gonna try and do my best

196
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:58,920
to be neutral and that includes and this

197
00:09:55,949 --> 00:10:03,238
is incredibly hard some of the time your

198
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,488
ability to say I am in the rough yes I

199
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:07,470
disagree with you yes I think this is

200
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,809
the stupidest choice you could possibly

201
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,389
make but the room is going against me

202
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:15,238
I'm on the rough end of this consensus

203
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:19,619
and you need is a chair to be able to do

204
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:22,259
that the flip side of that coin is you

205
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:25,910
need to be able to use good technical

206
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:28,980
judgment and this sounds contradictory

207
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,189
but you need to be able to hear what the

208
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:37,319
room is saying and say wait a minute you

209
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:39,799
know mary has this claim that this

210
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:42,689
protocol is gonna fall apart and

211
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,449
disaster is going to occur if we go

212
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:49,349
ahead in this method and you know what

213
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:51,269
that sounds right I can't figure out how

214
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,569
you people who are saying no no it's

215
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:57,899
gonna be fine are correct because I'm

216
00:10:54,569 --> 00:11:00,719
using my technical judgment to say that

217
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,610
is a real problem so you've got to have

218
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,589
the ability and this is why we put

219
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,660
engineers in these roles you've got to

220
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:11,480
have the ability to evaluate the

221
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:14,910
technical claims and make that judgment

222
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,040
balancing that with putting your own

223
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,139
opinion aside is hard but you have to do

224
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,129
that

225
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,939
um this one you've got to be willing to

226
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:26,759
take the heat

227
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:29,969
even if important people say that you're

228
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:34,699
wrong you've got to be able to stand up

229
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:37,049
there even if the person who is an ad

230
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:39,269
speaking in their capacity as just a

231
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:42,089
participant says no no you're out of

232
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:45,179
your mind and if you hear that the

233
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,889
consensus is against that person or that

234
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,779
person's just not making any sense you

235
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:55,709
got to be able to say sorry you're in

236
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:59,970
the rough that's sometimes hard one sub

237
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:02,040
point of that is there is I know this is

238
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,369
painful nothing wrong with getting

239
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,269
appealed part of the reason we have this

240
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:11,549
structure of you know we've got chairs

241
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:15,209
and they report to a DS and they rip it

242
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:18,059
and the a DS listen to the whole IAS G

243
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:19,888
and then the IAB is because you're

244
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:22,709
supposed to use your technical judgement

245
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:26,369
make the call but we have these backup

246
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:29,638
plans if you screw it up be confident in

247
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:31,889
making those technical calls and then

248
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,199
let the back-up plan kick in if it

249
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:36,540
doesn't that back-up plan starts with

250
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:38,878
someone comes up to you and says I think

251
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,360
you screwed up let's talk this through

252
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:45,269
cept you know offline and if they can't

253
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,249
convince you tell them it's cool if you

254
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,079
go to the ad convince the ad that I've

255
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:51,689
screwed up and let them come back and

256
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:55,488
explain to me that I've screwed up that

257
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:58,649
should be an okay thing to have happen

258
00:12:55,489 --> 00:13:02,189
the other piece of chairing and and this

259
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:04,589
is where I kind of at IRA not ironically

260
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:07,079
want to interact and and start the

261
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,989
discussion is that I think an important

262
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:12,179
part of chairing is following the

263
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:15,600
discussion on the list in the room and

264
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:18,569
doing both on the list and in the room

265
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,749
active listening what do I mean by that

266
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:24,899
I don't mean it in the you know kind of

267
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:29,119
psychology you know social worker way of

268
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:32,039
active listening the whole purpose of

269
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:32,279
having these discussions is to move the

270
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,810
dist

271
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,939
gushin to a conclusion right we want to

272
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,768
come up with this is what's going in the

273
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:45,899
document this is what we're gonna do

274
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:47,730
as the discussion moves along you are us

275
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,620
chair are the person who's calling the

276
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,790
consensus you're the one who is saying

277
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,459
here's what we've decided you need to

278
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,790
say out loud whether on the list or in

279
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:01,859
the room what you're thinking saying

280
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,660
things like it sounds to me like the

281
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,480
only objection is such and so

282
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:11,339
and that sounds answered so we're moving

283
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,249
along is really important because if you

284
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,079
make that statement and you've gotten it

285
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,670
wrong someone will then have the

286
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,469
opportunity to come up and say well oh

287
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,759
no no no no that's not the only

288
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:27,420
objection um I believe X is in the rough

289
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,309
will make hopefully the people who

290
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,800
support X come up to the mic and say

291
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:34,620
it's not just X and here's the reason

292
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,019
why that point is very important so you

293
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:42,350
want to drive discussion make sure

294
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:47,250
people are engaging if you don't know

295
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:50,220
where you are if you don't say here's

296
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,500
what's going on people will continue to

297
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:57,809
get up to microphone and say thing after

298
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:01,230
thing after thing and I know that we

299
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:03,779
love well I say this later on shouting

300
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,699
into the void people like to get up to

301
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,949
the microphone and say their thing and

302
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:09,599
not be responsive to either the last

303
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:12,149
person who spoke or the point that's

304
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:17,009
going on in the room what you want to

305
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:19,829
drive people toward is okay I heard Joe

306
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:22,949
say this thing does anybody have

307
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:24,388
anything that disagrees with Joe or are

308
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:26,849
you just standing at the mic to repeat

309
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,189
the same thing get the people who are

310
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,709
saying something different up there let

311
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:34,139
there be an interaction not just I'm

312
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:37,319
going to say this important thing that's

313
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:39,179
been said 20 times already if you're not

314
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,639
sure what someone is saying if you're

315
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:45,029
not sure what the import is ask the

316
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,980
question ask wait a minute okay so you

317
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:49,520
went through all

318
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:52,190
but what do you think of that do you

319
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,189
want this thing in the protocol or don't

320
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,170
you ask the question make sure that

321
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,010
you're getting people to state what

322
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:04,459
their position is and you'll get to the

323
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:06,890
outcome quicker that way if you haven't

324
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,750
heard a response to a point yet put that

325
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:13,430
to the room I haven't heard anybody

326
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:15,770
reply to this make people engage in the

327
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:18,439
discussion not just stand in the queue

328
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,860
to say their thing and you're at a loss

329
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,260
for where you're at your purpose as

330
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,410
chair is not just to listen to everybody

331
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:30,050
speak it's to understand what decision

332
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,329
the room is making and say that out loud

333
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,270
so that there is a decision on the floor

334
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:37,550
yeah finally

335
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:42,650
don't ask questions that you already

336
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:46,849
know the answer to what that tends to do

337
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:49,819
is move discussion away from conclusion

338
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,800
because people will get up and and try

339
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,240
and reinforce or try to speak against if

340
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,790
you know that there are only two people

341
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,910
in the room who are going on about this

342
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,620
one particular point and everybody else

343
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,399
really is convinced that nope they they

344
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,819
they don't have a point you know that

345
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:13,550
there's no need to continue saying okay

346
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:20,389
so which way are we gonna go yeah so

347
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:23,720
this brings us to the humming issue what

348
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:28,520
we're trying to do with the hum is avoid

349
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,140
having it come to a vote right we're

350
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,690
trying to get a sense of the room

351
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:37,820
without it being a vote and the majority

352
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:39,110
wins and the reason we want that is

353
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,290
because if one person's got the

354
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:45,639
showstopper or the obvious solution we

355
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:50,240
want them to be heard independent of

356
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:54,070
whether they're in the majority some

357
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,910
hums that we do are just anonymous votes

358
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,669
right we're

359
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,710
just doing a how loud is the hum okay

360
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:04,070
the quieter one loses the louder one

361
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,930
wins there's no point in that again

362
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,939
going back to if you already know the

363
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:12,080
answer why are you asking the question

364
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,300
if you need a multi option hum okay so

365
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,939
choice one is this choice two is this

366
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:20,000
choice three and by the way uh if you

367
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:25,040
want this one but not this one only hum

368
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,440
you're doing it wrong right so what

369
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,240
happens if you get a few quiet homes for

370
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,790
choice number two and choice number 63

371
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,210
what does that mean what is the meaning

372
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:37,159
of quiet homes quiet hums could mean

373
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,770
that the two people are going I've been

374
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,320
trying to tell you that this is just

375
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:45,080
screw ball and you know the the whole

376
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,169
thing is gonna collapse but you're not

377
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,720
hearing it are just humming quietly cuz

378
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:54,640
they're done you want to make sure the

379
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,490
points come out not just the hum um and

380
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,030
I've got a big issue with the feel good

381
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,910
hums right get everybody to hum together

382
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:08,540
on this one important thing the problem

383
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,070
with them is that it trains people that

384
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,710
if you can get everybody in the room

385
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:16,220
humming in the same direction that we

386
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:19,940
can bully out of order the people who

387
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,910
are humming quietly and so what you want

388
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:26,480
to do is get people in the discussion

389
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:31,550
not just humming - for the sake of

390
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:35,240
humming Brian I'm gonna push back a

391
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:37,220
little bit on that we we have a problem

392
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,740
in the ITF that we have people with

393
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,080
technical knowledge and with opinions we

394
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,690
want to hear who are afraid to talk they

395
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,580
don't come up to the mic what a hum does

396
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,260
sometimes is get those people to at

397
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,210
least acknowledge that they don't agree

398
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,280
with what has been said if you don't

399
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,820
hold it you don't know that's going on I

400
00:19:52,280 --> 00:20:00,820
I tend to agree with you there and and

401
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:02,720
I've seen a different technique used to

402
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,710
accomplish that and you can do it with a

403
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,510
hum as well which is ask the

404
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,200
contrapositive right instead of saying

405
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,129
who

406
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:17,720
say who wants not a start with the are

407
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,639
there any objections to a just do that

408
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,340
home don't even ask the opposite

409
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:25,279
question if you get a few hums if you

410
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,230
get silence than you're golden but if

411
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,779
you really suspect that maybe there are

412
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,289
some people out there who are objecting

413
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:34,639
who are just being a little shy about it

414
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:36,500
what you want to do is do things that

415
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:39,289
encourage them to come to the mic and

416
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,200
one of the things that I've seen is if

417
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:45,049
the first question is who wants a and

418
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,970
the whole room hums loudly that actually

419
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:47,450
discourages exactly who you're looking

420
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,500
for

421
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,169
so reversing the hum or asking it simply

422
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,820
as it does anybody in here I suspect

423
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:59,000
there are people in here who think this

424
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:02,510
is bull can you get up and tell me that

425
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,570
or do the hum that way I think is is

426
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:08,389
fine and and I don't want to object to

427
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,220
that right I I think having that home to

428
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:13,250
get those people to at least make some

429
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,049
noise and then start asking more pointed

430
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,260
questions why is that why are people

431
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:23,539
still having issues to encourage them

432
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:25,309
might be good push back I do on the

433
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:27,379
don't ask questions you know the answer

434
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:28,519
to is if you know the answer to it but

435
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,559
you don't know it's not clear to

436
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:32,269
everybody in the room knows obviously

437
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,279
it's the situation is everybody in the

438
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,600
room thinks X but not but that everybody

439
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:38,330
the room knows that everybody else

440
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,250
thinks X yes and so they all are coming

441
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,600
up in vehemently saying X X X is the

442
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,830
microphone for an hour and a half you

443
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,570
need to let everybody know that

444
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:47,720
everybody agrees with a good

445
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:50,928
clarification and actually um you know I

446
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:55,580
generally do that by way of saying what

447
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:57,860
I'm hearing is X I I don't hear anybody

448
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,070
in the room saying not X does anybody

449
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,620
think not X I think that's a that's a

450
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:07,700
great way to do it what I was more

451
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:10,100
pointing to was the idea of asking does

452
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,929
anybody think X because then people

453
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,149
think it's their responsibility to get

454
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,769
up and restate what you already know is

455
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:21,428
going on in the room so yeah good

456
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:22,770
clarification anything else on that

457
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:28,950
cool

458
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:35,309
um last bit and I don't know quite what

459
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:39,630
to do about this so I really hate this

460
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:41,190
idea of calling for consensus okay well

461
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,010
we've had this discussion now let's have

462
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:47,070
a call for consensus or on the list it's

463
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,440
time for a call for consensus the whole

464
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,000
discussion is meant to achieve consensus

465
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,870
you're supposed to be listening as you

466
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,140
go along and building consensus and it

467
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,760
makes it sound to me when people do this

468
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,700
like okay we've had the discussion now

469
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,280
it's time to vote and and that's not

470
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,010
what we're trying to do I mean it's good

471
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,110
to confirm that everybody's on board

472
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:14,640
with something and and I'm okay with

473
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:17,189
that but it this is more about trying to

474
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,800
get people's heads in the right space I

475
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:22,650
tend to like to at the end if there's a

476
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,510
question ask for objections ask for

477
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,850
people who you know state what you think

478
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:29,100
you the discussion is resulted in and

479
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:31,559
see if people disagree rather than

480
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,449
saying okay now it's time for everybody

481
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,100
to state their opinion they should have

482
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:41,190
been stating their opinion all along

483
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:42,870
Michael Michael Richards and so on so it

484
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,420
sounds to me like you're discouraging

485
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,520
chairs to get closure on an issue by

486
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,429
having a consent and well yeah that's

487
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,000
not what I want to do so help me here so

488
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:56,850
so what I'm trying is what I've asked

489
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,800
for a consensus it could contentious

490
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:04,530
issues or sometimes just you know we we

491
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,909
want to advance the document okay but

492
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,250
this is not a working group last call

493
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,679
this is a we think we got the art this

494
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:14,070
part right okay so I want to have a

495
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,929
consensus call on the list to do this so

496
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,909
what you're saying is that I think is

497
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:22,170
you're asking for the chair to say on

498
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:24,780
the list um do you have objections to

499
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:27,300
the architecture as bla bla bla and

500
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,460
specific sections for right I mean what

501
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:32,399
I what I think that's right I think what

502
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:35,130
I want is the formulation of it to be

503
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,160
even I don't I mean the calling it of

504
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,640
consensus

505
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,590
all whatever I I even have that in 2026

506
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,770
we even have that that word consensus

507
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:47,980
call don't we I don't think so or 2418

508
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:50,530
someone can check me on it but yeah I

509
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,380
mean what I want is the confirmation to

510
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,180
be clearly a confirmation and for people

511
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,940
not to get the idea that we're

512
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,680
relitigated the right right so that's

513
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,840
why we should ask for objections not

514
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,600
plus ones and I hate the plus ones are

515
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,810
useless yeah I think so too I think so

516
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,209
too

517
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:11,530
lower lo Anderson I think we have the

518
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,960
consensus call somewhere in some

519
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:16,870
document I tend to remember that it's

520
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,630
probably historical now or obsoleted or

521
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:23,679
something but I think you're using it

522
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:26,350
the wrong way a consensus call is when I

523
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,130
share tell the working group what the

524
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:33,159
outcome or discussion is and then period

525
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:36,520
right and it's good and and if it's that

526
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,410
formulation then I think thumbs up

527
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,750
there's too many times where I don't

528
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:43,560
hear that formulation where I hear the

529
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,700
consensus call as okay here's the issue

530
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,860
now there's a consensus call what do

531
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,950
people think and and that one always

532
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:54,459
strikes me as strange so yeah I agree

533
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,260
with you lower then so this may be a bit

534
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,540
of nitpicking but when we do the

535
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,740
situation where we have a sense of the

536
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,620
room and we want to confirm that

537
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,360
consensus on the list and I agree it

538
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,739
makes sense I'm noticing a pattern

539
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,510
almost all of the things you're looking

540
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,570
for looking for dissent not for

541
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,860
agreement but then I like that idea of

542
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:13,480
going to the list and say here's what

543
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,370
we're doing does anyone object however

544
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,230
sometimes it's really hard to tell the

545
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,870
difference between I'm not paying

546
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,830
attention and I agree right so we have

547
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,270
been known to say you know even if you

548
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,770
all you want to say is I've read this

549
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,060
and I agree please say it basically so

550
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,770
we want to know that people have read it

551
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,679
and agreed and so these seem a little

552
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:34,510
bit in tension yeah and and this is a

553
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,860
good point to add I think to the

554
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:41,530
presentation is the the problem of

555
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,850
silence be as agreement or as nobody's

556
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:46,600
read the thing and you can't tell the

557
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:49,689
difference I think is probably a failure

558
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,860
of the earlier discussion

559
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:54,429
that we've got to figure out a way to

560
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:55,870
start engaging people and and you know

561
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:58,870
so that they're actually saying things

562
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:01,059
upfront and that we have enough support

563
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,039
as the discussions going along and I

564
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,360
don't have a good answer for that and I

565
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,100
wanted to go on to say usually when I

566
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,019
see us do that it's in a working group

567
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,820
last call it might mean more sense then

568
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:13,419
than it does when you're just confirming

569
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,769
a consensus on a point yeah and by the

570
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:22,559
way I'm Ben Campbell I forgot to say

571
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:25,389
that Bryan yeah sorry and I'm Ben Caidic

572
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,668
so sort of falling off on that a little

573
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:29,889
bit I had some further thoughts or

574
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,960
insights about the emphasis on saying

575
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:36,158
you know doesn't even think X is a bad

576
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,080
idea or well who supports not X because

577
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,350
that's sort of getting back into the

578
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,220
role of the chair in terms of

579
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,990
understanding the consensus

580
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,029
understanding the technical facts like

581
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,669
it's sort of the presumption that you as

582
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:51,669
chair understand what's going on and

583
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:54,580
have a sense of things and so the call

584
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:56,200
here is more of like did I screw up it's

585
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,449
it's akin to the like the appeal process

586
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,220
you the chair think you know what's

587
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,230
going on think you understand the best

588
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,080
solution and it's sort of confirming

589
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:08,070
that you didn't miss something right and

590
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,879
and that's you know exactly go into this

591
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:15,158
second bullet of you know as chair it's

592
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:18,370
more important for you to be expressing

593
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:21,460
to call the consensus to say here is

594
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:24,070
what I'm hearing here is what I see the

595
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,289
consensus as and allow people to say

596
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:30,639
nope you blew it

597
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:32,230
and we do have a tendency both as chairs

598
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:34,269
talking to a DS as working group members

599
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:38,740
talking to chairs not to want to say you

600
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:40,870
blew it but that should be okay we

601
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,870
sometimes need to come up with nice ways

602
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:47,139
to say that and not say you idiot you

603
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:49,928
screw it up some of us like to say those

604
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:52,779
things but we do need to be able to say

605
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:54,629
I think you made a mistake here and and

606
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:57,629
get those gross so yeah absolutely

607
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:57,629
absolutely

608
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:05,799
or born gemser from gondwana often it's

609
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:07,149
not a choice between this is awful and

610
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,940
will destroy the world it's a choice

611
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:11,830
between x and y which are both 90

612
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,120
percent good and there's there's slight

613
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,580
differences and it will be a matter of

614
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,139
wearing the working group down to two

615
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,520
which is better they'll often still be a

616
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,559
lot of people in the room who like well

617
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,620
I think Y would be a little bit better

618
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,539
but I can live with X that's the tricky

619
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,580
thing to answer when it's this is going

620
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:31,000
to break the world it's easier to get a

621
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:35,230
real consensus on that you know is

622
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,510
Suresh in the room for those who don't

623
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,850
know the story and I don't remember the

624
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,190
working group if someone does you can

625
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,860
soft wires and I thought this was just

626
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,570
brilliant so it seemed like they had

627
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:51,490
this big contentious thing of multiple

628
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:52,840
choices and eventually what Suresh did

629
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,440
which I thought was just brilliant he

630
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,658
said okay we're gonna do a coin flip

631
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,370
now everybody did a little bike shedding

632
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,679
on the form of the coin flip and what

633
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,389
all the rules were but actually that was

634
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,299
good because it sort of distracted

635
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,940
people for a while and it turned out

636
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:13,110
once they did the coin flip everybody

637
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:17,710
said oh yeah that's okay

638
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:20,260
sometimes it takes the chair cutting the

639
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,059
baby in half for the working group to

640
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,750
actually decide oh yeah that that choice

641
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:29,200
is fine and and so it's a perfectly

642
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:30,909
acceptable mode so long as us chair and

643
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,950
sort of the working group in the back of

644
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:35,230
their mind understand that what's being

645
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,940
done is just introducing a forcing

646
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:42,090
function to get the working group to get

647
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:45,100
off its butt yeah Wes her to career is a

648
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:49,240
so I'm looking for advice on determining

649
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:51,250
consensus in difficult situations where

650
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,750
so as you said sometimes you you

651
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,820
shouldn't even need to call for a hum

652
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,370
because you should already know

653
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,809
consensus though the one issue that I

654
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,529
have with that and I watched it at least

655
00:30:58,809 --> 00:31:04,120
twice this week

656
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:06,309
is that IETF participants tend to be

657
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,590
kind of negative and want to tear apart

658
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:10,570
ideas more than they want to admit that

659
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,490
they like some elements or they're

660
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,490
willing to fix ideas often doesn't even

661
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,990
come up right there's

662
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,740
rarely an offer to fix stuff there's an

663
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,870
offer to to find your holes and there's

664
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,460
often a couple of loud voices sometimes

665
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,919
they repeat themselves at the microphone

666
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:27,679
and it becomes very very difficult in

667
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,750
those situations to determine consensus

668
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,040
especially in things like boss words

669
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,150
you're sort of like presenting a new

670
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,690
idea and you're inviting people to come

671
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:37,280
you know tear it to shreds I've watched

672
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,720
that happen at least twice this week

673
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,190
that I can think of off the top of my

674
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,990
head and it's probably happened at every

675
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,050
IETF and every meeting to a large extent

676
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:55,280
so what can I do

677
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:59,720
yeah I I like the mode of asking those

678
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,850
folks okay and you know as soon as they

679
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:07,820
finished their pitch of why this is just

680
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:12,320
horrible okay so this is a showstopper

681
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,879
and we simply can't do this or is this

682
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,290
something that needs to be fixed and

683
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,809
therefore you're going to give me

684
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:23,090
something to fix it to push those people

685
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:25,220
there are especially if you suspect that

686
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,500
the answer is this is something that can

687
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,410
be fixed or it's an objection but it's

688
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,700
not a showstopper doing that push helps

689
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:36,830
I can a very present example in my head

690
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,900
where I tried to do something along

691
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:42,830
those lines and what I got back was no

692
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:46,580
it's broken it's fully showstopper dead

693
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,840
you're wrong Pete and at that point you

694
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,120
have to go back to the working group and

695
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,699
say okay that you know this is presented

696
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,830
as a showstopper can someone obviously

697
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:58,309
folks in here don't think it is can you

698
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:01,970
come up and explain why it's not what

699
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:04,730
you're looking for I think is in the end

700
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:07,190
it assuming you actually have enough

701
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,960
information you want ammunition to be

702
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:12,429
able to say that the persons in the

703
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,380
rough if that's what it is and so and

704
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:17,240
and sometimes I agree it's hard if the

705
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,580
person is very strong voice and

706
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:23,749
everybody else is kind of

707
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:25,580
I don't when I watch them yeah yeah the

708
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:28,149
other the other besides just being a

709
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,309
loud voice sometimes the market dominant

710
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:32,928
force you know can can sort of dictate

711
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,190
the entire phrase for this one they say

712
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:36,320
I'm not going to implement and it

713
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,379
doesn't matter if two smaller you know

714
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,369
vendors say well I will and so we run

715
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:46,009
into that issue too

716
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:49,699
yeah and look when I described those

717
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:51,919
cases in seventy to eighty two when you

718
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,470
know the room does really get packed or

719
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,070
the important person does say you know

720
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:59,899
no this is wrong

721
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:02,418
we this organization makes bad choices

722
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:05,508
because of those things sometimes and

723
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:11,589
I'm not sure there's any way perfectly

724
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:17,599
out of it but if you see it coming I

725
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:21,078
have absolutely no qualms about helping

726
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,879
yourself as chair by especially on the

727
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,649
mailing list in the room is a trickier

728
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,029
business but on the mailing list off

729
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:31,909
list saying come on you know this is

730
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:34,549
bull help me out here and say it

731
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:38,599
publicly so that we can at least have a

732
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:42,349
rational discussion I I mean that sounds

733
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:43,849
sneaky but what you're in effect doing

734
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:46,399
is encouraging discussion and I don't

735
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:48,589
think there's any downside to that um I

736
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,558
mean obviously if you're doing it with

737
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:53,449
your biases that's that's bogus because

738
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:56,540
then you're just trying to support your

739
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:58,430
position but if you are honest with

740
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,609
yourself and doing it as chair and you

741
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,960
know look someone out there has an

742
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:04,759
answer to this and they're just not

743
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,030
saying it and I know who those people

744
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,040
are kick their butts into actually

745
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:15,410
participating in the discussion and that

746
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:18,558
that's part of your job as chair yeah hi

747
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:20,720
Boyd I found this very useful I have a

748
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:24,170
question earlier on in your presentation

749
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,868
you mentioned that it is okay to screw

750
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,750
up and let people will appeal to the ad

751
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:32,540
yes please I especially like that part

752
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,390
is there a formal appeal process or

753
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,990
should I just

754
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:41,578
no contact babies um so 2026 describes

755
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:44,788
something relatively formal um I there

756
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:48,119
was one case where I made a decision as

757
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:50,819
chair and I knew there is going to be

758
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:53,730
one person in particular I'm not going

759
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:58,259
to name names who thought that I had it

760
00:35:53,730 --> 00:36:00,930
was just a bogus decision and you know I

761
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,859
made the consensus call and there it was

762
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:08,160
and I said look write it up I mean

763
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:11,069
literally write up point by point where

764
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:16,529
I screwed up and let's get back to the

765
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:20,819
ad and and let the call be made and the

766
00:36:16,529 --> 00:36:22,589
act of doing that actually helped to a

767
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:25,619
certain extent that person feel better

768
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:29,279
but also to make sure that we got the

769
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:31,740
right answer so you can I mean the first

770
00:36:29,279 --> 00:36:34,349
few steps in 2026 about appeals are

771
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,200
pretty informal go to the ad and talk to

772
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:40,529
them but make it as formal or informal

773
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,609
as as helps your particular situation I

774
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:47,369
also decided it helps to have this ad

775
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:49,529
office hours so chairs can provide a

776
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:51,809
little bit of a heads-up of what they

777
00:36:49,529 --> 00:36:57,299
can expect is coming so perhaps that

778
00:36:51,809 --> 00:37:11,910
that's another tool we can use he gave

779
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:14,670
up on me Richard so an on ietf of you

780
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:16,578
too okay well since there's nobody in

781
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,910
the queue yeah we could wrap this up

782
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:20,160
everybody good

783
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,839
so if you have comments on the

784
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,109
presentation things that you think I

785
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,750
should add please email me um because we

786
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:30,480
do want to build this up and you know do

787
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:34,079
a more expansive and every so often that

788
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,720
would be helpful um my suggestion Pete

789
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,019
before he run away with them about what

790
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,720
else we could do is I would think I

791
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,720
think it would be useful if we actually

792
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,220
either put on a play or something in

793
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,290
Sunday morning or something

794
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,848
and maybe involve chairs but in the

795
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,310
audience-participation kind of things

796
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:57,000
where we where we actually went through

797
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:00,240
the processes that you talked about okay

798
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,310
because one of the problems with

799
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,290
particularly big scheduling conflicts

800
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:06,210
and is is that some chairs just never

801
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:10,050
actually get to see the interesting

802
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:15,630
stuff like what happened in spring okay

803
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:17,849
happen okay and and experiencing it okay

804
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,569
I think would help them apply it

805
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:20,940
elsewhere

806
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:23,670
okay I think you might need better

807
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,710
actors than me but okay well well you

808
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,069
know you you can you can direct or

809
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:32,250
produce or something right you know but

810
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:34,050
and actually um I like it

811
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,020
in the sense that we the other thing we

812
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:40,109
can do is we do have all these meet echo

813
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,000
recordings yes so even if all you did

814
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:45,328
was collect a bunch of recordings

815
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,490
together into a 15 minute you know thing

816
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:49,230
and with the pause button like let's

817
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,359
talk about what happened that would be

818
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,250
also useful I promise with permission of

819
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,900
those people who are chairing I I swear

820
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,880
every woman and of course you could

821
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,040
record that part and then we could

822
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,560
become new working group chair training

823
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,859
material riesling yeah I like that thank

824
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,560
you

825
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:09,930
all right thanks all right Thank You

826
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:13,828
Pete all right Greg are you I know you

827
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:15,390
were here there you are so you all will

828
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:17,280
have seen a couple emails from Greg

829
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:20,759
about gathering feedback on the website

830
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:35,430
and he is here to talk a little bit more

831
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:38,760
about that my name is Greg would I do

832
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:41,098
ITF comms I work for Ice Hawk and I want

833
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,930
to first of all say thanks to everybody

834
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:43,859
he's already provided feedback I'm just

835
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:48,210
going to run through a little bit of

836
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:52,190
what we're trying to do here and maybe

837
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:52,190
get some more feedback see if this works

838
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,599
No

839
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:04,160
excellent so a couple days ago I put out

840
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,489
a note to the working of chairs list

841
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,609
asking for feedback on how people use

842
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:15,709
the ietf website specifically dub dub

843
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:17,209
dub DTS org and this is sort of a couple

844
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:19,219
years after we rolled out the new

845
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:23,448
version of the website which is not so

846
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:26,059
new anymore and in particular interested

847
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:28,630
in how different people use it so

848
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:30,559
workgroup chairs are super important and

849
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,890
I've already gotten some really good

850
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:36,999
feedback so thank you very much one of

851
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,379
the pieces of feedback we got was this

852
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:41,089
drop-down menu in the upper right corner

853
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,809
we can do anything else we wanted to the

854
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:47,449
website but don't change that which is

855
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:49,130
great because as we were developing the

856
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:51,109
site one of the things we heard was we

857
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:53,630
need we need quick access to these kinds

858
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:55,130
of things so it turns out people are

859
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,119
using them and finding them valuable so

860
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,660
we're not we're not going to change that

861
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,969
for sure

862
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:04,279
and one of those links on that drop down

863
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:06,319
menu leads to this page one of the

864
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:09,680
pieces of feedback we got about this

865
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,259
page was its needs refreshing generally

866
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,598
and so that's definitely a task we're

867
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:18,799
going to do I see people at the queue

868
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:21,410
already which is great and can I just do

869
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:22,819
them one last slide I have and then okay

870
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,949
Fred wants to say something right away

871
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:32,150
so we're probably gonna say the same

872
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:36,739
thing about your typos yeah so read the

873
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:39,729
top line of IETF 1:06 live we have the

874
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:42,199
next line got it okay thank you

875
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:43,999
so people so people saw the drop down

876
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:46,609
menu and they were so focused on that

877
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:51,890
they didn't until now read the no but

878
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:53,989
thank you very much we'll fix that yeah

879
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,249
so so we heard the people are using this

880
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:56,680
page but it needs to be updated so

881
00:41:55,249 --> 00:42:02,448
that's definitely a task that we're

882
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:06,198
taking on wrong way there we go

883
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:07,640
but then we also have heard some or I

884
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:09,859
also received them feedback that

885
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,859
sometimes the boundary between data

886
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:13,230
tracker and eye

887
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,450
is not always well-defined which

888
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,980
actually I take to be good news that

889
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:21,859
people can move across these two

890
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:25,650
different sites and use both of them but

891
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:27,720
it's it's not exactly clear how to

892
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,390
provide feedback in a really easy way so

893
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,290
that the right people hear it and things

894
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:37,410
get fixed so we'll work on that as well

895
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:40,110
I already talked about how some of the

896
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:43,410
specific pages need to be updated to

897
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:47,400
working on that and another great piece

898
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:50,339
of input we got or implicit I've seen so

899
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,840
far is that a really useful thing to do

900
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,190
would be to consider consider some

901
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,730
typical workflows that working group

902
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:01,470
chairs face and to understand how well

903
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:02,520
those work which is also a great

904
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:05,509
feedback and something we're definitely

905
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,040
going to do and those are all my slides

906
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,050
that I guess I would end with the

907
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,270
request to say if you have other

908
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:15,090
feedback that you haven't seen me

909
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:16,500
summarize here please make sure to send

910
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:20,490
it to me either by email or just

911
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,110
stopping me in the halls and in

912
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,549
particular if you have some specific

913
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,170
workflows that you think ought to be

914
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:28,470
considered some tasks that you do on a

915
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,970
regular basis that either work well or

916
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,669
that you run into obstacles and getting

917
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:34,020
done that kind of specific feedback

918
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:37,770
would be super super helpful because

919
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:41,820
then we can optimize for that and that's

920
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:49,320
that's my talk all right did anybody

921
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:53,160
have any additional feedback Dave

922
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:55,170
altameyer so so one thing one of the

923
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,480
things I've always found helpful in like

924
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:01,700
working out a website or multiple

925
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:05,730
websites is you know what what is the

926
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:07,230
the audience of of the site right and it

927
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,120
seems like we have a very interesting

928
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,460
challenge with regards to the IETF

929
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:14,009
website and the data tracker right

930
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,050
because the ITF what's website is

931
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:18,780
intended for people who might be novices

932
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:22,110
for the IETF to find out about what you

933
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:24,839
know the IETF is all about and what work

934
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,789
we're doing you know how we meet how

935
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:29,670
you know interact and that sort of thing

936
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:31,799
and then there's the data tracker which

937
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:34,559
is much more about the business of the

938
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:38,210
IETF right and so folks that might be

939
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,739
somewhat knowledgeable about how to

940
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,539
interact with the IETF would probably go

941
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:44,700
to the data tracker it's a you know to

942
00:44:42,539 --> 00:44:47,069
do their work I think the challenge is

943
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,019
like figuring out how to convert the

944
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:51,359
first group of people into the second

945
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,609
group of people right and how to bridge

946
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:58,308
the gap between the two the two websites

947
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:58,308
have you have you put any thought into

948
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,579
into how to serve those different

949
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,519
constituencies have you gotten any

950
00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:09,150
feedback so far is there any way that we

951
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:11,848
can help in helping to you know I did to

952
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,829
solve that problem any thoughts yeah

953
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:15,539
well I those are those are excellent

954
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:18,119
points it's certainly something that we

955
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:20,549
explicitly considered in terms of

956
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,489
defining the audiences when we did the

957
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:24,900
initial website revamp in addition to

958
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:28,200
asking working group chairs we're also

959
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,269
asking ITF newcomers what they have

960
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,328
found useful how for what could be

961
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:38,669
improved and we're also asking people

962
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:40,140
who don't necessarily work in the ITF or

963
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:43,410
won't work in the idea but still need to

964
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:47,118
know that the IDF is important to try

965
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:50,879
understand how well things work for them

966
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:54,180
but tier fatir I guess I would kind of

967
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,769
turn to Karen maybe or rich I mean the

968
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,509
question that I take is the most

969
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:59,578
interesting one anyway is how do you

970
00:45:57,509 --> 00:46:02,700
convert potential participants or

971
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:04,289
newcomer participants into like regular

972
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,460
participants or you know eventually

973
00:46:04,289 --> 00:46:08,519
working group chairs or something like

974
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:11,940
that that is a question that certainly

975
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:15,689
the website ought to be a part of but

976
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:20,309
it's not the only only that's not where

977
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:21,479
the whole answer lies is that yeah so we

978
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:22,440
took into account the audiences

979
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:25,229
definitely the different kinds of

980
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,880
audiences and it's definitely something

981
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:28,649
that we're asking for feedback from from

982
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,609
those audiences to understand how things

983
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:34,559
work and it's an important it's a

984
00:46:32,609 --> 00:46:37,339
generally important question that

985
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,079
probably extends beyond the website

986
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:43,308
to start for that is to try to figure

987
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,989
out you know for different for different

988
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:47,239
parts of the site what are the audience

989
00:46:44,989 --> 00:46:48,950
that we're trying to reach and then you

990
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:51,349
know working backwards you know from

991
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,269
from there it's possible that like

992
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:55,400
different parts of the data tracker will

993
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:57,229
have you know different audiences you

994
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,509
know we've talked today about you know

995
00:46:57,229 --> 00:47:01,879
reaching chairs versus reaching you know

996
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:03,499
general participants so I think it's

997
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,900
important to identify those different

998
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:08,058
user groups and then consider that as

999
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,349
far as the workflows are concerned right

1000
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:12,469
because it's the workflows that are

1001
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:14,539
gonna bridge the difference I think um I

1002
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:16,969
would make a couple observations first

1003
00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:18,529
of all I've heard Greg over the course

1004
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:21,349
of the last year to use the term

1005
00:47:18,529 --> 00:47:24,710
workflows many many times when

1006
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:27,380
associated with this website as far as

1007
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,359
transitioning people I think there's

1008
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:31,700
there's a package be on the website of

1009
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,920
how do people interact with the IETF and

1010
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,899
what information do they get where and

1011
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,239
how effective it is and we are going to

1012
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,759
try and collect better data on that and

1013
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:44,299
get get more feedback I mean we already

1014
00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:45,319
try to you know we have a newcomers

1015
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:47,809
feedback session and one of the

1016
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:49,549
questions we ask them is you know did

1017
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:51,140
you come to the website you know what

1018
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:53,960
what did you find useful what did you

1019
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,739
not find useful I think doing a more

1020
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,210
systematic analysis is something that

1021
00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:00,589
we're hoping to get some help with have

1022
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,359
you asked the question like what were

1023
00:48:00,589 --> 00:48:07,339
you looking for when you came to the

1024
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:11,869
website yeah yeah yeah for sure that's

1025
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:13,489
part of the prompts hi room engineer you

1026
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,019
search a ad on a thread I would just

1027
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:18,950
like to remind everyone we went through

1028
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:20,499
a spirited discussion on how to do a lot

1029
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:22,609
of this thinking we're doing from a

1030
00:48:20,499 --> 00:48:24,558
empirically driven approach and the key

1031
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:26,089
element of that is doing web analytics

1032
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,069
on the site so we have a better sense of

1033
00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:29,690
who's using it in what ways they're

1034
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:32,329
using it what's popular kind of what's

1035
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:34,849
not and from my conversations with Greg

1036
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:36,680
I mean we see this as a key driver to

1037
00:48:34,849 --> 00:48:37,700
kind of inform what we do next and we

1038
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,489
hope to be able to share that with the

1039
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,489
community all right thank you Greg

1040
00:48:47,769 --> 00:48:52,279
well I'm gonna switch hats slightly

1041
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:53,569
briefly so the next thing on the agenda

1042
00:48:52,279 --> 00:48:56,599
was just I was going to talk very

1043
00:48:53,569 --> 00:49:03,079
briefly about the status of some edgy

1044
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:09,559
activities and where you're right about

1045
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:12,259
the bifocal thing it seems worse than

1046
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:17,259
some of the others I know it's not for

1047
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:19,519
the weak of heart so anyway there is

1048
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:24,650
there is a whole set of activities

1049
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:26,689
around education targeted at newcomers

1050
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:28,689
targeted at working group chairs and

1051
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:32,239
then general technical information

1052
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:34,939
there's also an overarching set of

1053
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,829
newcomer activities that looks at the

1054
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:40,629
education again it looks at mentoring

1055
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:43,869
and outreach it looks at other ways the

1056
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:49,099
that the you know the website materials

1057
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:51,019
so there is going to be a a in the side

1058
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:53,119
meeting on Friday Society fried meeting

1059
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:55,218
on Saturday side meeting on Friday

1060
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,249
morning there's going to be a session on

1061
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:59,630
sort of brainstorming about some of the

1062
00:49:58,249 --> 00:50:01,368
activities that we're doing there how to

1063
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,779
get them more better organized how to

1064
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:04,640
get more resources and how to prioritize

1065
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:06,319
them anybody that's interested in that

1066
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,499
could come along and the other thing

1067
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:11,150
that I need to post the edgy mailing

1068
00:50:09,499 --> 00:50:12,738
list has historically been a closed

1069
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:14,859
mailing list and we have opened it up

1070
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:17,390
but I haven't seen a rush of new people

1071
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:19,038
subscribing so I'm going to post again

1072
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,499
that this is actually a public mailing

1073
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:26,150
list and anybody that's interested in a

1074
00:50:21,499 --> 00:50:27,259
Jew a qts is free to join that so that

1075
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,059
was all I really wanted to say about

1076
00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:31,729
edgy activities I expect that maybe in

1077
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:33,170
the March timeframe if we might come

1078
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:34,698
back with a little bit more information

1079
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,539
about all of the various things that

1080
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,189
we're doing and where we could

1081
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:38,809
specifically use help but there are a

1082
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:41,359
number of opportunities for you all who

1083
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:42,619
would like to do additional would like

1084
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:45,949
to help in some of the various areas

1085
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:47,059
here one of the ones in particular I

1086
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:49,160
would point out is if there are

1087
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:52,579
technical topics that you're interested

1088
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:54,379
in we we've sort of left it at this

1089
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:56,449
point for folks to volunteer to do

1090
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,039
technical topics I know that Stewart

1091
00:50:56,449 --> 00:50:59,580
Cheshire did an excellent one on service

1092
00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:00,930
discovery on Sunday

1093
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:03,600
I think there are a number of things

1094
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:05,220
that would be useful but it requires a

1095
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:09,509
folks in the community to volunteer to

1096
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:10,919
do that and so now it is 107 and give an

1097
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,550
email that I sent recently to the

1098
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,670
mailing list

1099
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:16,320
I can't dare run over so you have about

1100
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,670
six minutes for open mic is there

1101
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:35,570
anything else anybody wants to bring

1102
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:38,460
forward any suggestions or thoughts so

1103
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:42,990
this is something I brought up with

1104
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:45,300
Alisa so it's not something I think is

1105
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:47,129
unique to our working group I think I

1106
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:52,369
would think other working groups would

1107
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:57,300
be impacted so the situation is we have

1108
00:51:52,369 --> 00:52:00,869
people from a certain company and you

1109
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:04,800
can guess pretty much and they have

1110
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:10,850
certain restrictions of interacting with

1111
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:13,770
other people in other companies and we

1112
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:16,380
Mia's Vyas workgroup chairs are trying

1113
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:18,420
to help them but I think one of the

1114
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:23,850
requirements for them is they have to do

1115
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:26,369
this on a public mailing list the only

1116
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:28,799
public mailing list that I can suggest

1117
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:31,830
as well use the working group mailing

1118
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:34,109
list for all your so called almost

1119
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:37,069
private discussions just to figure out

1120
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:39,440
how to move forward on the document so

1121
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:42,450
what I mean I guess I'm opening up to

1122
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,970
this group is to ask as if anyone has

1123
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:49,040
encountered that situation and if they

1124
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:49,040
have any suggestions on how to deal with

1125
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,230
lists Alisa

1126
00:52:56,539 --> 00:53:02,209
elissa Cooper so I think there's a bunch

1127
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,819
of working groups and author groups that

1128
00:53:02,209 --> 00:53:07,129
have essentially formed design teams and

1129
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:08,989
created a design team man lists for

1130
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,239
themselves Melling lists are cheap to

1131
00:53:08,989 --> 00:53:14,089
create so if anybody needs a mailing

1132
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:16,969
list for this purpose you can contact

1133
00:53:14,089 --> 00:53:18,380
your responsible ad and it should be

1134
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:21,049
pretty straightforward I know there's

1135
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,489
other people who are just collaborating

1136
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:23,929
on github or they're using a Google

1137
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:26,509
group or something else that which is

1138
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:29,329
which they can make public but if you if

1139
