00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:34,238
live so we have a very tight agenda

7
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,030

00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,619
will ask the presenters to really stick

9
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,069
to the time and if you are willing to

10
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:46,330
make comments please be to the point and

11
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:48,789
try to be short so goals of the IGF the

12
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,440
IGF conducts research it is not a

13
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,899
standards development organization

14
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,209
this is a sort of message reminder that

15
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,800
we are putting in research groups to

16
00:01:55,209 --> 00:02:01,810
highlight the difference between rhf and

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:05,039
IETF nevertheless IETF follows IETF

18
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,390
policies and so this is the note well

19
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,090
reminder on the IHF policies in effect

20
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,680
on various topics such as patents or

21
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,629
code of conduct so please be aware of

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,700
those policies and comply to them so

23
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:20,349
this we can skip we already have thanks

24
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,359

please bring it back so that we can also

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,310
circulate them during the meeting

34
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,150
a quick glance on what will be left this

35
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,530
week so we already close to the end of

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,480
the meeting but today we have our first

37
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,150
session which will be concentrated on

38
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,819
intern base networking and tomorrow we

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,590
have also a second session with two main

40
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,859
topic discuss a bit of the rich

41
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,890
authoring process and a synthesis of the

42
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,380
different activity on network artificial

43
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,299
intelligence as I said we have two full

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,650
agenda so please stick to your time and

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:13,450
be concise in your comments this is the

46
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,819
agenda of the first session so we are

47
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,829
currently in the introduction after that

48
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:20,530
we will make a quick report on the

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,049
interim meeting in October in rabaa that

50
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,650
was focusing on in practical aspect of

51
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:28,480
IBM then we have a couple of technical

52
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,340
presentation on the active internet

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,899
draft for the group intern

54
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,780
classification from all there that will

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,660
be removed and Alex which will make an

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,120
update on the IBM concept draft and then

57
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,120
the final sort of today we have a set of

58
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,600
technical presentations I will not go

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,040
through that but this is covering a

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,450
different set of topics and also new

61
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,170
proposals anybody has something to add

62
00:03:52,450 --> 00:04:00,130
or change to the agenda

63
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,470
squit for you so a bit of overview of

64
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,570
the status of the research group there

65
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,970
is an ongoing revision of the Charter we

66
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:10,090
have sent email yesterday to the group

67
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,859
and also to the IETF chair we think we

68
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,480
have a stable version of the revision

69
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:16,000
but it's welcome we welcome your

70
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,940
comments and we'd use on this new

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,380
charter so you have the link to the

72
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,969
Charter and on the mailing list you have

73
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,350
also links to the comparison between the

74
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,229
document and the first version of the

75
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,660
Charter so the idea is to have a kind of

76
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:31,240
umbrella text covering describing

77
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,510
quickly the main research direction of

78
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,490
the group and the relationship and also

79
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,039
to highlight a more detailed word plan

80
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,960
on the intern by topic which is the main

81
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,530
topic the working group the research

82
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,690
group is working on so far

83
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,849
we aim to approve the new charter by the

84
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,190
end of this year and of course your

85
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,659
comments and feedback are most welcome

86
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,850
we will have a bit more time to go

87
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,920
through the recharter ring tomorrow

88
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:03,590
but in the meantime you can either look

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:06,290
at this and send us your comments we

90
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,830
have also sent to the group and discuss

91
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,840
about a proposal for procedure of

92
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,330
adopting research group documents there

93
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,840
is no formal process in the ITF for the

94
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,280
research group how to approve in to move

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,560
internal documents to research group

96
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,179
documents this is on purpose we don't we

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,940
are not a working group so this is not a

98
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,710
formal process but still we want it 12

99
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,390
to document a clear process so that

100
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:31,190
everyone is willing to move towards

101
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,870
research group documents and can know

102
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,380
how be the criteria we will use as a

103
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,120
research group chair to to validate or

104
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:43,010
not the progress towards research group

105
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:45,530
documents so work as usual zero

106
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,409
precondition so update your individual

107
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,400
draft taking track on the comments

108
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,250
discuss the issues on the meaning list

109
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,340
so keep dating your document this is a

110
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,520
good sign that this document is alive

111
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,400
then for the adoption first check that

112
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,380
you validate a set of criteria do you

113
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,419
have a precise scope of the draft needs

114
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,430
to be clear and hopefully will not

115
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,950
change once the research group document

116
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,690
is adopted we are looking for we are

117
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,479
doing research we are looking for good

118
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,880
scientific quality and we expect a good

119
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,219
impact also in the community so it needs

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,870
to be a rigorous scientific base and the

121
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,430
current contents must be mature enough

122
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,710
we are not looking for finalized

123
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:30,200
document but still we need to have not

124
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,200
mature enough technical contents in the

125
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,680
document we need to also have indication

126
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,120
how you plan to continue the efforts the

127
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,940
content of the draft evolution of the

128
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,400
document must be already player if you

129
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,430
can have also an indication of work plan

130
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,469
on milestone this is even better and to

131
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,300
know a bit more we will work on the

132
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,010
draft so this is we hope commitment from

133
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,330
the authors but also in the group if you

134
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,039
have indication of people willing to

135
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,750
review or if you are willing to join the

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,580
effort this is also important indicators

137
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,660
to know that this is of importance to

138
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,979
the research group and that it will be

139
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,780
progressed I need to speed okay and then

140
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,669
request for adoption so you can ask it

141
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,700
on the meet during the meeting on the

142
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,310
mailing list and also the

143
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,930
research group chair we also forward the

144
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,090
the the call for adoption on the meaning

145
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:19,050
list to let anyone a chance to to

146
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,849
comment an overview a few projects that

147
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,400
we have inside the research group so

148
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,950
idea and resource a project this is an

149
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,650
idea to create a place website to get

150
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,300
whatever the form we have not said yet

151
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,099
which will be open to all and to a user

152
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,720
for an interface to collect external

153
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,700
resources on intern base networking

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,440
technologies article standards

155
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,210
documentation on product whatever it

156
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,500
could be useful for the community to

157
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:46,560
have in one place we're also working on

158
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,690
a participation to Akutan we have a

159
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,510
target a bit in the future July next

160
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,430
year in Madrid we would like to grow the

161
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,280
idæan activity on practical aspects with

162
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,770
development of tools demonstration of

163
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,539
proof of concepts so the idea is to also

164
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,549
work theoretically in the research group

165
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,990
but also make some implementations and

166
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,810
we want to leverage the European

167
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,000
location also to invite different teams

168
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,970
European or white teams but also in EU

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,340
funded projects and so we have made

170
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,410
first steps at this hackathon to connect

171
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,919
and you will hear more in the coming

172
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:22,770
weeks we also need network AI challenge

173
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,960
project as your home will make synthesis

174
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,210
of that tomorrow

175
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,549
different aspects were working on

176
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,690
definition of the use cases

177
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,240
identification of datasets oil relation

178
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:37,919
platforms and publication aspect of the

179
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:40,320
challenge meeting plans for next year so

180
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,478
this is tentative there is a lot of

181
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,180
things that are still open but we plan

182
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,240
to meet in the difference i HAF meetings

183
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:51,000
we also plan to have a few internal

184
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,520
meeting face to face co-located for

185
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,700
instance with IM noms to 2020 in

186
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,550
budapest as we used to do we are also

187
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,290
looking to have ensuring either in tokyo

188
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,829
with the IPOP conference or in a

189
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,630
brazilian with SPRC conference this is

190
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,020
still being discussed with the local

191
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:13,230
organizations and we have also monthly

192
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,090
virtual meetings so we will see if we

193
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,950
need one in december but at least next

194
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,950
one will be surely in mid-january

195
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,700
was it for the research group status any

196
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:33,240
question on the research group before I

197
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:35,519
move to the report if not okay so this

198
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,610
is a quick report on the interim meeting

199
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,700
we had in October in Roma and co-located

200
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,709
with the network of future conference

201
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,570
the focus of this interim meeting was

202
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:49,079
practical aspect of intern business

203
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,399
working we have invited for a joint demo

204
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:53,849
session with the conference and we

205
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,910
received four papers three demos and

206
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,010
invited invited torch to make

207
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,779
demonstration on IBM technologies and

208
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,500
also discuss we have two days of

209
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,939
sessions discuss a bit more the

210
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
practical aspects of intern base

211
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,060
networking technology we wrote a report

212
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,620
of this event so this is currently

213
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,930
available on the data tracker you have

214
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,120
the link here but this user will also be

215
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:21,120
published as part of the Proceedings of

216
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,220
the conference so you have you can find

217
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,170
it on an ultra poly Explorer and also

218
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,279
the the demo papers were part of the

219
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,829
conference and they will be published

220
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,689
with the proceedings

221
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:32,880
we thought this was a very useful and

222
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,589
kind of different meeting that we have

223
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,070
here that we used to work with virtual

224
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,540
meeting order interim we have a lot we

225
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,240
learn a lot from the implementations

226
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,180
they had to make decisions on the format

227
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,370
of intent the infrastructure to support

228
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,199
it the transformation of intensive it

229
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,649
was really useful to compare different

230
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:54,390
choices and also to confront theory and

231
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:57,029
practice because in the group we had

232
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:58,410
several drafts but this is a theoretical

233
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,750
design and then in the implementation

234
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,199
this was not to report on implementation

235
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:07,260
choices and it's also it was also

236
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:09,060
helpful to generate further ideas for

237
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,529
for instance the akhaten project and

238
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,500
collaboration between different teams

239
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:15,360
working on those tools again the idea is

240
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,910
not to go into a full report if you want

241
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,089
to read a bit more there is a four six

242
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,760
pages reports available you can also

243
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,019
come to us it's very synthetic very

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,000
quick to read you have all the

245
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,839
information on the demos the links and

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,949
all the materials also available on the

247
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,949
the interim meeting page

248
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,380
we have also identified a few further

249
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:42,450
directions out of this meeting so to

250
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,060
create a code repository for the tools

251
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,490
and the demos and with insert

252
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,609
installation guides and installation and

253
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,940
user guides this is still in our to-do

254
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,589
list we have also defined a Ibn tool

255
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,860
data sheets to describe the different

256
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:01,470
experiments so the participants of the

257
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,660
meeting committed to describe their

258
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,010
tools using these data sheet you think

259
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,230
it will be useful also to have these

260
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,800
data sheets so that people can know a

261
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,589
bit more what are the the tool is doing

262
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,630
and also provide a bit of documentation

263
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:17,579
we work with we're also proposing to

264
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:19,709
have a kind of mapping table mapping

265
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:22,229
table is to make the bridge with the

266
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:23,910
draft on intend classification so in the

267
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:26,040
demo they have made choices of the

268
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,230
environment the intern format so the

269
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,170
idea was to use the mapping table to see

270
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,940
where it fits in the classification so

271
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,670
maintains and updates of your overall

272
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,970
IBM told you so this is this kind of

273
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:41,550
this is the true review so we have a

274
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,829
draft intent lifecycle and we try to map

275
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,149
the component of the different demos to

276
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,489
the different stages of the lifecycle

277
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,320
the different functions so this was a

278
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,750
work in progress during the the meeting

279
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,060
and we want to keep updating this table

280
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,529
and use it to understand if we are

281
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,390
missing something in the life cycle if

282
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,790
some fortune ality are well designed or

283
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,040
we need to split them etc so this is -

284
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:07,380
to use this as a tool to understand a

285
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,939
bit more the the entire life cycle we

286
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,279
have follow-up interactions there have

287
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,260
been point to points between the teams

288
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,910
say ok what you have done can also be

289
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,170
used in my demo we can interconnect so

290
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,490
they will we expect that there will be

291
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,349
more exchange between the different

292
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,500
teams and to have also follow-up

293
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:24,660
meetings on particle aspects and as I

294
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,579
said we are developing a project to

295
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,310
participate in the a cotton in IETF one

296
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:32,089
write in Madrid next year and we are

297
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,109
working with your home to make a kind of

298
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:39,390
presentation of what we have to do there

299
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:41,910
and and connect with a set of teams so

300
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:45,949
that's it for the report some questions

301
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,949
on this meeting and perhaps

302
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,050
so if not we will switch to the next

303
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,050
presentation

304
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,160

319
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,649
screen sorry for this I'm really sorry I

320

I'll try to be quick because I took a

322
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,610
few minutes of your time

323
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,309
so what I'll what I'll present today is

324
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:59,280
the version 2 of our intent

325
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:02,730
classification draft and and here is the

326
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:09,450
list of contributors through version 0 0

327
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:12,210
0 1 & 0 2 so next slide for those of you

who sorry the previous for those of you

329
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:18,330
who were not who are not familiar with

330
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:21,240
this draft our goal was to achieve

331
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:24,840
agreed terminology related to intense

332
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,480
and to propose a classification approach

333
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,049
for different types of intends for our

334
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,679
group but also to guide other groups in

335
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:37,410
ITF ITF and even other standards so

336
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,460
folks of this draft is the user intense

337
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:44,730
and to define and classify those intense

338
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,669
the scope was you know relevant for any

339
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:50,100
system or node that expects interaction

340
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:52,590
with human user in the int and River

341
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,770
networks and that human user besides

342
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,290
being operator administrator and use a

343
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,690
customer is also the application

344
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:04,100
developer who is building applications

345
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:07,799
on top of the intent interface and

346
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:12,600
intend driven approach is applicable to

347
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:15,000
both autonomic networks and and networks

348
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,309
the new future networks it machine

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,590
learning and AI as well as the

350
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:21,980
traditional networks where it can intent

351
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:25,020
could be used on top of the existing

352
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:29,159
controllers and management systems etc

353
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:32,629
our classification approach was based on

354
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:33,900
different solutions users their purpose

355
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,450
lifecycle

356
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,090
judgment requirements scope in the

357
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:42,360
network scope network function scope etc

358
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,280
and also abstraction for the interns

359
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,340
whether they're technical with technical

360
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:51,740
feedback or not so and we have different

361
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:54,840
intent examples next slide please so

362
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:58,410
this is the these are the milestones for

363
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,689
draft as you can see version zero one

364
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,930
and we are here now in November 2000 and

365
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:06,740
nineteen we are proposing version two to

366
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:10,650
be adapted and then we are looking at

367
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:12,900
potentially at March 2020 for the

368
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:16,830
version three which would include all

369
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:19,020
the comments and outstanding things so

370
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:23,340
the the following is the list of

371
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:27,990
comments received and and we addressed

372
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:31,290
all of these comments we added some use

373
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,120
case references some of the comments

374
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,570
would be addressed by different draft

375
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,409
that we started for the intent framework

376
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,909
because this draft is only about intent

377
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:44,580
classification some of the comments one

378
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,470
of the comments that Diego had was more

379
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,929
related to the framework so therefore

380
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:53,430
there is a new draft intent framework

381
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:56,120
being started on there was also a good

382
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:00,090
suggestion from Lauren about the

383
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,399
classification table and as the table he

384
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,820
discussed when presenting the status

385
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,430
from the Rome meeting and that is we

386
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,429
added that table as Excel but then also

387
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:13,500
to the draft so that everyone can use it

388
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,070
and that box can use it for their

389
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,620
classification so we would appreciate

390
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:21,620
any comments for any of the paths but

391
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,239
especially for classification table

392
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:27,419
there were also comments from Ericsson

393
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,320
about the they they proposed not to use

394
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,520
the term granularity and instead to use

395
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,700
potentially abstraction so we also

396
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,930
addressed this issue added abstraction

397
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,580
section but also use the input from

398
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,960
China Telecom where they were suggesting

399
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,850
to talk about technical feedback or not

400
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,389
so we we we now have a

401
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:54,389
proposal to use for clarification

402
00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:56,399
obstruction technical with technical

403
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:59,248
feedback or non-technical without

404
00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:02,008
technical feedback there are other few

405
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:06,830
comments that we are going to address or

406
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:10,739
been addressing at the moment next page

407
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:15,029
so so this shows the table of contents

408
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:15,989
for version 1 and what parts have been

409
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,019
changed

410
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:22,080
mostly main updates in this version so

411
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:24,359
you can see that section for those who

412
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,090
want to review only the change sections

413
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:29,668
already review the previous version its

414
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,999
section 3 the two intend solutions and

415
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:35,759
intend users in section 4 by point 2

416
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:39,210
which used to be granularity and now

417
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:42,720
it's called feedback section 5 has been

418
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:47,519
added and it is a intent classification

419
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,340
table example with table for careers

420
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,909
table for data center solution and table

421
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:57,029
for enterprise solutions and section 5

422
00:22:53,909 --> 00:23:00,779
has been moved to 6 and we added 7

423
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:06,809
clarifications in section 6 which has

424
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:08,599
been moved to section 7 next slide

425
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:12,779
please

426
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:15,450
so the use cases and some reference is

427
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:18,659
valid the example for carrier networks

428
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:21,629
scenario use case where the user wants

429
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:24,929
to watch high-definition video and the

430
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:27,359
system then has to map their intent into

431
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:30,269
the technical requirements for the

432
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:34,320
network for data center network

433
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:37,559
scenarios the use case was about intend

434
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,619
such a flawed balancing where the

435
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:44,820
administrator wants to restrict the

436
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:48,570
maximum load on the node container below

437
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:54,769
50% and maximum load on any link below

438
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:57,450
70% for enterprise network scenarios

439
00:23:54,769 --> 00:24:01,110
when hosting a video conference

440
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:05,040
the remote access is required

441
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:09,260
and the network operator has an intent

442
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:11,010
that for any use of the application that

443
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,540
everything has to be synchronized

444
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:17,820
between 50 milliseconds the video in

445
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:20,460
order to reach the destination viewer of

446
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,070
each conversation session so these are

447
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:28,679
the use cases in China Telecom and help

448
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:31,320
to bring this use cases next slide so

449
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,440
the feedback section was added and and

450
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:38,010
we classified we created two categories

451
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,990
here your ordinary users so that would

452
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:44,429
mean customers and users or

453
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,410
non-technical users or application

454
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:49,590
developers you know some applications

455
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,620
that there where they don't care about

456
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:54,600
how intent is executed really did what

457
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,928
they interested in is the feedback in

458
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,928
terms of success or failure of that

459
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:04,919
intent other type of the users is more

460
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:07,110
technical users and for them they that

461
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,210
intent may be more technical but their

462
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,428
feedback may also be technical because

463
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,380
what they are interested in is they're

464
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:15,210
also interested is how intent is

465
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,630
realized on the network so they

466
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,760
interested in network resources parts

467
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:23,940
some some resource information so in

468
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,030
that case it would be a technical intent

469
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,419
with technical feedback and next slide

470
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,418
please

471
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:38,510
so also there was some request to add

472
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:41,910
some more information about how a I a

473
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:44,429
technology what role it can play in the

474
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:47,210
intent driven networks intend based

475
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:50,429
networks so we added some explanation

476
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:55,110
into section 6 the originally section 6

477
00:25:50,429 --> 00:26:00,090
was talking about that a IML driven

478
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:03,719
system would be driven by intent by the

479
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:06,000
goal intent or policy intent goal intent

480
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,240
would present the target state and

481
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,690
policy intent would present some

482
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,050
guidelines in how to realize and deliver

483
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:18,960
that goal intent but there are

484
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:21,870
additional explanations added and maybe

485
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:26,040
I won't go through all of them here how

486
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:29,360
a I may be used for security translation

487
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:32,250
or closed-loop self optimization self

488
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,939
correction so you can maybe look at that

489
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:40,910
chapter section and do your comments the

490
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:44,160
next slide it's also additional

491
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:47,760
explanation in that section so these are

492
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,940
some examples of how ml and AI could be

493
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:56,550
used and some example of how clustering

494
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:58,980
algorithms could be used next slide so

495
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:01,889
here is the just example of one of the

496
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,430
tables and this is really where ever it

497
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:08,100
would be great for all pox from our

498
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:12,270
previous meetings to may be position

499
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,389
themselves and of course any comments we

500
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,879
consider this table we did take a lot of

501
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,010
comments and and we'd kind of spend a

502
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,590
lot of time working on it but of course

503
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:24,930
we are hoping that in version 3 of this

504
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,360
document there would be more reviewers

505
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:29,850
and contributors which should bring

506
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,500
value to this table this is example of

507
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,629
different type intents this is for

508
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:39,210
carrier solution normally where we

509
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:41,610
identified different intent types based

510
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,850
on the solution we did some descriptions

511
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:47,699
and we also proposed initial categories

512
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:52,080
which could be based by the intense

513
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,360
scope or a network scope or abstraction

514
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,189
and also life cycle because we believe

515
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,889
there are two types of intense those

516
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,730
that are kind of Golden Goal intense

517
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:04,980
that that a persistent one that that

518
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:08,730
focused on the full life cycle like a

519
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:11,520
target Network service or and there are

520
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:14,520
those transient intense like short

521
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:18,300
living interns which are some actions

522
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,879
that intent users are doing so that

523
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,010
there are two types of interns so please

524
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,860
see these tables and

525
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:33,090
tell us if you have any comments on

526
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:35,580
those next slide so so the conclusions

527
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,770
here our current version addressed most

528
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,110
of comments received online and offline

529
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,780
there are some comments that we received

530
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,280
also in in the last few days and we

531
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,230
would be addressing them in the future

532
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:51,330
but we do believe that because of major

533
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:54,570
updates and as well of addition of

534
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:58,290
classification table it would be good we

535
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:01,439
want to ask for adoption of version 2 as

536
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:03,809
a draft so that this draft could be

537
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,360
reviewed from now on by the community

538
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:10,139
these are some of the next steps like

539
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,149
start using collaboration tool and we

540
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,950
put it currently on the Google Drive as

541
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:17,040
the version but we we would communicate

542
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:19,830
with all contributors and maybe get

543
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,168
their preferences we won't alter the

544
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,480
section briefly describing intent work

545
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:27,990
status another SDOs

546
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,929
and we also want to work with community

547
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:33,540
to de river unified intent definition

548
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:36,299
that encompasses all intent types for

549
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,220
all solutions and intent users so these

550
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:40,610
are some of the next steps and also to

551
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:43,770
address all additional comments and

552
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:46,439
update a document based on the response

553
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:48,600
and feedback from the community they

554
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,350
also have few additional contributors

555
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,209
that that show the interest potential

556
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,790
contributors that show the interest so

557
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:01,110
they may add more contributors to the

558
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:09,030
list so I would like to I would ask for

559
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:12,600
adoption as a draft thank you Thank You

560
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:15,230
Olga so come in from Christian for

561
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,230
people in the room

562
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:23,190
no okay

563
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:31,299
so maybe a one question from from for

564
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,820
myself jean-francois not not as a as

565
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:36,158
charity group you are mentioning in in

566
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,039
the modification you have done I think

567
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:41,830
you you are mentioning this

568
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:44,860
classification rating the feedback from

569
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:49,059
the intent realization and when reading

570
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:52,330
the text for me it seems that you it's

571
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:54,129
exclusive classification that an intent

572
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:57,489
will provide it back to the user or not

573
00:30:54,129 --> 00:31:00,070
in the realization of the intent but I

574
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:03,970
suppose that for example an internet

575
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,408
express by hand user can actually does

576
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,820
not need to project back to the user

577
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,619
itself because it does not need to know

578
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,289
the technical realization of the intent

579
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:13,418
but at the same time yet misrata of the

580
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:16,169
system may want to have the feedback to

581
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:22,330
know all the user intent as mineralised

582
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:25,570
13z basically gez the feedback that you

583
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,580
were expressing there may not be any

584
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:31,049
directly to who has expressed intent

585
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:34,359
yeah you are right for the for the

586
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:36,340
customer intents and application interns

587
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:39,730
administrate and operator would always

588
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:42,129
be able to see the states of the network

589
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,649
and to check the network but this is

590
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:47,980
specifically mentioned if the

591
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:52,149
administrator and operator is the intent

592
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:54,879
user so in that case their intent would

593
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:57,039
be more technical than the intent even

594
00:31:54,879 --> 00:32:00,580
if their intent does the same thing as

595
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,730
the intent of the customer let's say

596
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:06,720
network service so if the customer

597
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:09,730
requests the network service it may be

598
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,419
it may be non-technical if the

599
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,519
administrator requests it would it could

600
00:32:13,419 --> 00:32:18,429
be more technical but also the feedback

601
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,909
it receives for that could include some

602
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:25,059
realization information and if it's

603
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:27,190
another user non-technical intent user

604
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:30,549
then that feedback wouldn't contain that

605
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,389
information so we are talking about both

606
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:33,099
intent we

607
00:32:31,389 --> 00:32:36,070
technical or non technical but also

608
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:39,218
responds to that intent being non

609
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,928
technical technical but I agree like the

610
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:44,289
administrator and operator would also

611
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:50,700
have his ability into intense of all

612
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:54,158
other users yeah so the zelich's come

613
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,109
and I also dress also from a cursory

614
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,209
read but perfectly explained this year

615
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,918
so looking at all the tables that you

616
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,629
were adding with a classification one

617
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,539
thing that is not quite clear to me is

618
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:06,549
how you would actually use this I mean

619
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:09,789
this is very refined you can be given

620
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:13,719
greater and hilarity tag basically the

621
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:16,629
the different it tents that yeah they're

622
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:18,789
not being defined but how would that be

623
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:22,958
expected to be to be used I mean other

624
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:24,609
different the different methods going to

625
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:27,099
be associated with different types of a

626
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:29,049
tensor is this a way to basically

627
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:30,668
catalog which she intends belong

628
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:33,849
together or can you perhaps comment a

629
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:36,789
little bit on the usage of thanks for

630
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:39,189
the question the the the comment the

631
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,169
suggestion he really came from the

632
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:43,389
chairs from from Laurent and I think

633
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:45,219
that was a good very good comment for

634
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:47,408
the previous revision because the

635
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:49,749
original revision was mostly text and it

636
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:51,579
was talking about you know we can have

637
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:53,709
these type of intense and death

638
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:56,649
those type of intense and then during

639
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:58,659
the last meeting we had parks and demos

640
00:33:56,649 --> 00:34:01,539
so we were saying it would be great if

641
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:03,909
he can classify those different parks

642
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,759
and demos so the teach POC or dime or

643
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:08,940
any tool in the industry can say these

644
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:11,668
are the categories that we are

645
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:14,679
delivering and this is our focus so

646
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:17,288
primary primarily we were looking at

647
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,649
this table as being a tool that could be

648
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:23,079
used with different pox and Deimos to

649
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:26,409
say this is the intent that we are

650
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:31,029
demoing or this is the type of category

651
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:33,929
that he addressing I hope that answers

652
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:36,639
the question thank you

653
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:39,740
sure thank you

654
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,540
okay thank you we have to close the

655
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,379
comment now because we already bit over

656
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,790
time so thank you very much olga for

657

presenting you all you have some word of

658
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:52,219
conclusion on the the coal gas for as

659
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,800
egyptian as energy 12 so my first

660
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:57,379
question will be to know who in the room

661
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:08,870
has weighed the document please raise

662

useful for the group okay great and so

665
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:32,600
many of you think this document is ready

666
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:40,070
for edgy adoption okay yeah so between

667
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:43,549
between 1 and 2 I will say so maybe oh

668
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:45,230
yeah we will anyway you send a formal :

669
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,060
the milling is to have all the feedback

670
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:49,130
from all the participant as we say in

671
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,220
the procedure and then based on the

672
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,590
feedback we will be able to take a

673
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,600
decision and discuss with you so you can

674
00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:01,430
also review the difference in back you

675
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:03,170
will have but thank you again Olga we

676
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,680
move to the next speaker

677
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:10,590
I think it's Alex right

678
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,589
[Music]

679
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:31,869
so I think this is easier so good

680
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:33,400
morning everyone I'm Alex Clement

681
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:35,049
presenting a status update on the

682
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,859
intent-based networking concepts and

683
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:41,319
overview draft first number revision 3

684
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:43,749
this vergis also found vision on behalf

685
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:48,549
of the co-authors blown his angle con

686
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:51,868
villain chef Francois so basically since

687
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:54,430
last time the draft has undergone one

688
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:58,209
one revision cycle so you know in

689
00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:00,038
revision 0 3 and basically the updates

690
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:04,288
are all pretty much every tutorial

691
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:07,359
nature one thing basically there is

692
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:09,849
consider section con said the intent

693
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,509
life cycle we did a number of diagrams

694
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:16,180
but relatively little text so basically

695
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:19,509
these text textual gaps have been have

696
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,848
been filled in and the life cycle has

697
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:23,769
been described in much greater detail

698
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:27,130
including the various intent fulfillment

699
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:29,198
in and intent assurance functions which

700
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:33,969
are part of it life cycles and how they

701
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:35,890
interact with each other so that there's

702
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:38,079
one update the second update is there

703
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,118
was a section on research challenges

704
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,410
which we felt was actually not

705
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,099
appropriate for the scope of this graph

706
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:48,249
so this section has been removed so this

707
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:52,089
is just again the intent life cycle

708
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:53,198
diagram which is ok I think in the

709
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:54,400
interest of time we don't have to go

710
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,380
through this this has not really been

711
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,690
updated this has not change but

712
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,690
basically this is about this concerns

713
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,949
the aspect of the document it has

714
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:07,359
undergone a lot of texture of revision

715
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:09,279
and so this here is the document

716
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,519
structure so the updated document

717
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:14,109
structure and compared to previously you

718
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:18,328
will see it's essentially the same

719
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:21,910
structure but - the research challenges

720
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:25,269
in terms of open items and accepts for

721
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,848
this document so there are a few

722
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:29,229
editorial updates that that still need

723
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:30,910
to be made one thing is basically

724
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:33,100
there are currently two diagrams on the

725
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:36,700
intent lifecycle which need to be

726
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:39,430
consolidated there's one aspect second

727
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,169
aspect is because a lot of the function

728
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,060
have been defined as partner of the

729
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,430
lifecycle there's some textural

730
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,590
alignment that editorial and yes that

731
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:49,899
has to occur between section 6 which

732
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:51,550
talks about the lifecycle and section 7

733
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,540
which talks about the function so you

734
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,800
could not really talk about the

735
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,050
lifecycle without talking about the

736
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,890
functions so there's some alignment that

737
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:01,630
these would take place there the third

738
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,940
question is but you listed currently as

739
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,130
an as an issue whether or not to address

740
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,590
this here this concerns basically

741
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:10,330
whether we need to distinguish between

742
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,550
different categories and then and

743
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,840
different intent granularity the

744
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,490
questions may be whether the rock when

745
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,230
should talk about this at all or we just

746
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,029
leave it to the intended classification

747
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,950
document and perhaps that is actually

748
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,119
the appropriate answer but anyway this

749
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:25,319
is maybe one of the issues that is

750
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:28,900
listed currently in the in the document

751
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,869
and then finally basically we want to

752
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:35,200
update or we want to add security

753
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:38,530
implications and challenges so busy the

754
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,419
security considerations that are unique

755
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:47,619
to intend it because that introduces new

756
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:49,570
security issues okay so in terms of also

757
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:52,000
next if we do believe actually that the

758
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:55,119
document well this is very weird fits

759
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,820
with e within the energy charter so

760
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,980
basically documenting the fundamental

761
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:03,240
concepts background and terminology this

762
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:06,250
is the main focus of this document and

763
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:08,279
accordingly we wanted to actually also

764
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,780
request like the previous speakers and

765
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,640
requested option as anonymity work item

766
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:18,760
because we believe it supports directly

767
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:21,879
the our Charter um questions

768
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,879
[Music]

769
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:38,450
hello viola p.m. I think that when it

770
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,859
comes to the to the categories precisely

771
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,450
when you mention this category is

772
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:45,800
another like this is precisely one of

773
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:47,950
the things that they still miss in the

774
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,900
in the other document the classification

775
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,700
because establishing those categories is

776
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,350
whether classification missing maybe you

777
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:58,460
and this is something that is not mature

778
00:40:54,350 --> 00:41:00,470
enough in the other one I believe it for

779
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:02,600
the other one because it looks like they

780
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,129
tried like the natural ways that were

781
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,950
making a classification establishing the

782
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:09,320
categories there so so that we have here

783
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,390
well not a problem but the mother of

784
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,790
synchronous synchronizing the other

785
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:17,420
thing and when it comes with the

786
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:20,390
security implications and think that is

787
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:23,930
a great idea because it's something that

788
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:27,950
is essential and the when talking about

789
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:31,640
the intent and having you know this kind

790
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:34,339
of long-forgotten issue when talking

791
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,109
about this about I'd say ice prayers or

792
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:41,390
whatever what and I think it deserves

793
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:44,630
note that it is also more attention

794
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:47,660
about how is the security of intent and

795
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,790
how you express security requirements by

796
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:53,390
intent basis and something that deserves

797
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:55,970
more attention note that so far what I

798
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:58,040
have seen in the draft is still in a

799
00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:01,700
burly early stage but this I think it's

800
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,009
a it's a quite interesting path to

801
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,270
follow

802
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:06,620
thank you yes so we'll definitely I

803
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:08,540
think the implication need to be

804
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,160
analyzed clearly in regarding the

805
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,779
classification and one thing the

806
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,790
discussion we need to have actually but

807
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,500
we had in mind originally for this

808
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,690
document not the the other one was

809
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,700
actually a much coarser level but just

810
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:23,180
distinguishing between the high level

811
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,859
operation content intent versus intent

812
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,569
for service instance versus the intent

813
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:29,120
for the force for fro and just leave it

814
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:31,420
at that but anyway thank you for your

815
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,420
comments

816
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,460
so if the reason now is our comments I

817
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,029
will go through the same question as

818
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,910
before as you call also for LG adoption

819
00:42:46,030 --> 00:43:00,740
soku has read the document please raise

820
00:42:49,910 --> 00:43:03,850
your hand okay twelve cool things this

821
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,850
document is useful

822
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:24,069
same and could think this document is is

823
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:27,230
ready for the group adoption okay ten so

824
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:29,180
as before so this is the first feedback

825
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,820
we get and then we Center official

826
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:34,279
calendar on the mailing list to have a

827
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:40,150
more feedback thanks thank you Alex

828
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,150
so next speaker Luis please can you come

829
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:58,460
hello everyone so I represent the Indian

830
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,550
basin working approach that we are

831
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:03,320
following if I Yi pro yet so this is a

832
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,609
tool basically developed by the people

833
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,700
from winds which is opponent of the

834
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:11,890
consortium and I will present basically

835
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:16,250
on behalf of him so just for

836
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:19,190
understanding what 505 is basically to

837
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:21,590
set up facility for a foggy

838
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:24,410
experimentation across Europe so there

839
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:26,150
are facilities in Spain Greece Italy and

840
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:29,290
France with doing the currently

841
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:31,070
datacenters and it is to offer

842
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,619
abstractions to the vertical vertical

843
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,119
customers in order to deploy services in

844
00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:36,440
that's all services they kind of

845
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,810
vertical customers that we have in the

846
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:44,930
project are a utility companies like

847
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:48,040
electricity de France or train companies

848
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,868
like Trenitalia or a give assistance

849
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:55,130
assisted different sectors from

850
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:57,500
industrial space so sorry briefly the

851
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:59,390
architecture of I give what we have on

852
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:02,000
the bottom part of the site is this

853
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,609
multi-site facilities with a number of

854
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,109
tools for orchestration and

855
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:08,210
programmability of the networks we have

856
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:10,700
osm we have phone app we have different

857
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:12,200
kind of Sdn controllers there on top of

858
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,750
that the blue box that you can see there

859
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,399
is the multi site in a

860
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:18,080
interworking framework which basically

861
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,750
tries to work the different sites for

862
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,250
the deployment of the other services

863
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,570
just to mention that the service here in

864
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,790
the context of I give are basically

865
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:28,700
experimentations or are experiments to

866
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:32,000
be run and to check the industrial case

867
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:34,250
in in in every situation and on top of

868
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,859
that we have a portal and through this

869
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:41,839
portal the vertical customer can request

870
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:43,490
the this presentation and can order this

871
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,790
presentation and the deployment in of

872
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:50,209
your site's holding 10 basis stuff is

873
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:52,250
here in the box a agree box and I will

874
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:55,310
explain basically what well it consists

875
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:57,560
now so in 10 base the purpose of

876
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:00,170
inter-basin if I give is to provide a

877
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,150
way for this vertical experimental set

878
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,650
the instance it is an experiment so they

879
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:05,509
experiment designed at the finish on

880
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,329
face and little on the trigger for being

881
00:46:05,509 --> 00:46:10,279
deployed in insights through this

882
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:12,349
intent-based what we basically do is to

883
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:14,749
translate the the request of the

884
00:46:12,349 --> 00:46:17,390
vertical to the political service

885
00:46:14,749 --> 00:46:19,730
blueprint so basically - we filled we

886
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:21,828
fill a form for the describe in the

887
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:26,690
experiment and passing through the

888
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:28,910
orchestration framework the the final

889
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:31,579
step is the creation of this experiment

890
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:33,848
descriptor in such a way that what these

891
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:37,279
services deployed and experiment is run

892
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:40,900
there are two choices at the time of the

893
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:44,900
clay in the service one is the usage of

894
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:47,329
a guided selection through a graphical

895
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,099
user interface a kind of wizard and the

896
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:51,950
other one is the free text translation

897
00:46:49,099 --> 00:46:55,160
where basically the requests of this

898
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:57,740
pediment or the vertical is interpreted

899
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:01,098
and is translated for filling up that

900
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,140
form only tool will be documented in

901
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:04,730
deliverable for the one from this

902
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,129
project that this is likely to be

903
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:08,599
released as public in a in the for

904
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:11,420
coming months so probably by the end of

905
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:13,130
the year will be already public the

906
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,289
galena to design we have a graphical

907
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,849
user interface that allow the dispara

908
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:19,309
mentors to provide their intention so

909
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:21,589
they write down what is the objective of

910
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:23,660
the test experiment to be performed

911
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,819
there is a translation tool which

912
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:29,680
basically take that information from the

913
00:47:25,819 --> 00:47:33,410
same vertical vertical customer and

914
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:36,890
translate and try to fill the vertical

915
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:40,249
service with a blueprint for for the

916
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:42,650
play in the experiment at all in case

917
00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:44,029
that the song fields are missing and so

918
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:46,430
there is no process of iterative

919
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:49,640
interrogation such a way that finally

920
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:52,069
the system can fill all the details also

921
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,808
the tool is consists of a database where

922
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:56,599
all these experiments are stored and

923
00:47:53,809 --> 00:48:00,440
also these databases use for check-in if

924
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:01,849
in in the intended site to really play

925
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,680
the service there are enough resources

926
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:05,779
for further breeding the service and

927
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:09,950
also the to check the scheduling of the

928
00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:12,529
experiment and basically a server all

929
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:14,509
this application insist or you have here

930
00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:15,660
a link to the tools so probably this

931
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:18,780
tool also can be

932
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:21,950
of the tools that are positive that you

933
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,569
you were mention at the beginning so

934
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:26,160
didn't beat the the two different

935
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,839
notions that we have we have this free

936
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,089
text format so basically the

937
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:32,220
experimenters made if in my define an

938
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:34,049
intention by using natural language so

939
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,868
they express the experiment that they

940
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:39,990
will they want to perform the way of

941
00:48:36,869 --> 00:48:42,210
expressing the Perriman is basically the

942
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,578
political customer requires to use some

943
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:47,220
kind of key words or some key words they

944
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:50,190
say and in some cases on special

945
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:53,359
characters characters for identifying

946
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:55,920
the specific field for instance the

947
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,920
specific format for the time of the day

948
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,680
so my specific format for the date to be

949
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,950
run this spellemann' also for signal in

950
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,308
the number of instances and so in case

951
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:12,629
that there are NT files that the office

952
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:14,220
that cannot be completely filled after

953
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:15,569
the intention of the other political

954
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,538
customer the system is able to

955
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:20,339
interrogate the vertical again for

956
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:23,279
completing the information which is

957
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:25,170
machine yeah

958
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:28,260
and in case the the vertical

959
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:30,650
experimenter put some data that is not

960
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:33,599
run at all that is wrong or this is not

961
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:35,910
good at all the system disabled as well

962
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,420
to innervate the vertical in order to

963
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:41,730
fix what is what can be be seen for you

964
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,799
cannot see from there but the the here

965
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,809
some examples of how this is happening

966
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:48,150
and in any case this will be documented

967
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:51,809
in a in the variable that I mentioned

968
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:53,760
before the second way of requesting the

969
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:57,359
service with this guided selection which

970
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,160
is basically a kind of Whizzer well the

971
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,859
vertical customer can go through

972
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:05,399
different menus let's say and start

973
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:07,589
filling the data for this Perriman if

974
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,279
something is not filled the system is

975
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:12,660
able to provide default values and at

976
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:14,640
the end of the process also the system

977
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,520
integrates the vertical customer to be

978
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,319
sure that the parameters that will be

979
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,579
part of the experiment are correct at

980
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:25,710
all so that was what we are doing in

981
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:27,450
fact if the next steps that we are

982
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:30,390
considering is to generalize this

983
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:35,009
concept to the processing of the SMA of

984
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:36,230
the EPP as ice templates so in both GSMA

985
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:38,670
and 3vp

986
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,700
both are working in this and apple slice

987
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:43,380
template so the idea would be to take

988
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,868
this ideas that we have developed if I

989
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,400
give porting them to the request of

990
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:48,599
services that would be expected from

991
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,180
coming from fy'y

992
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,920
from front VPP let's say for for the fiv

993
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,109
services for the new college license

994
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,140
another intention is to document this in

995
00:50:55,109 --> 00:51:01,980
in address target in annex ITF for

996
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:04,500
reporting well having some some grapple

997
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,839
of how this has work in reality in the

998
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,750
de ferran experiments and also we're

999
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:12,538
exploring this way of holding this ideas

1000
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:20,279
to 3d PPS stuff and that's all from my

1001
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:25,410
side do you have questions any question

1002
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:29,400
on the presentation so you mentioned

1003
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:30,859
that I see clearly a connection with the

1004
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,930
activity want to do on the

1005
00:51:30,859 --> 00:51:36,420
experimentation this could be a good

1006
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:37,649
addition to the to the pool of demos you

1007
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,510
mentioned that you would like to work on

1008
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,430
a draft yes

1009
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:45,059
have you already identified if it will

1010
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:47,490
be more towards the IETF or IO GF or and

1011
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:50,069
what will be the it would be a kind of

1012
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:52,919
use case experimental type of draft or

1013
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:57,119
more and they be able with those

1014
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,799
properties I mean to take this idea that

1015
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,270
we have a sporting fate but port into

1016
00:51:58,799 --> 00:52:01,770
the generic case nice template and then

1017
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:05,190
I want a slice template from VPP

1018
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:07,319
so because they did what we have if I

1019
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:11,250
give these vertical service blueprints

1020
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:13,079
are not does not much higher actually

1021
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:16,049
the area slice templates and whenever I

1022
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:17,700
see a plate so they do would be to take

1023
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:20,609
this from experiments that we have done

1024
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:24,180
in five but moving to work with what

1025
00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:29,400
could be a true as I Stan a slice

1026
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:31,490
request from VPP okay thank you thank

1027
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,490
you

1028
00:52:33,030 --> 00:53:02,760
our next speaker will be Mitchell good

1029
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:06,170
morning everyone my name is Misha boffin

1030
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,940
I am a PhD candidate at to invest

1031
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:11,370
further on the worst of Pernambuco and

1032
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:15,480
I'm here today to present a work that is

1033
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:17,310
part of my pd thesis and it consists of

1034
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:22,860
a solution for goal oriented policy

1035
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:25,170
refinement in FEV man assistance so

1036
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:28,110
let's start by defining policy

1037
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:30,810
refinement this is the process of

1038
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:35,510
transforming high-level policy into

1039
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:42,810
directly enforceable low-level policy

1040
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:46,130
however policy framing is a non-trivial

1041
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:50,100
process and it remains a much neglected

1042
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:53,430
research area and concerning and a few

1043
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:57,600
mono systems this task is usually done

1044
00:53:53,430 --> 00:54:00,480
manually and the situation opposed the

1045
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:06,980
presence of a knowledge expert whenever

1046
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,980
this procedure is required and besides

1047
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:15,689
this K of change can be massive which

1048
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:19,080
can lead to improper specification of

1049
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:25,020
important enforceable policies due to

1050
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:31,700
human errors so we argued that this

1051
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:34,890
procedure must be done in automatic way

1052
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:44,160
in order to reduce the gap between human

1053
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:46,710
attention and in FEV mano behavior so a

1054
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,109
fully automated refinement process in

1055
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:52,770
nefi I'm an assistant editor an open

1056
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:55,830
issue this contest we take we tackle

1057
00:54:52,770 --> 00:55:00,150
this problem and we propose a dns

1058
00:54:55,830 --> 00:55:03,170
planner that is coronated policy finally

1059
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:06,200
procedure for an FEV my assistants and

1060
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:10,170
basically it combines the rich

1061
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:12,390
description logic is expressivity with

1062
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:15,300
the efficiency of automated plan

1063
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:19,470
assistance base it on your desk iroquois

1064
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:21,030
task networks so it you basically use

1065
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:23,910
our well-funded

1066
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:26,690
etienne planner to perform the gory

1067
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:30,210
netted policy refinement procedures and

1068
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:33,359
it proposes the use of one ethology in

1069
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:35,390
addabbo l to call it on top laner this

1070
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:40,339
is mythology will be responsible for

1071
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:46,618
store the current state of the world and

1072
00:55:40,339 --> 00:55:48,869
of course the state constraints so this

1073
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:51,510
figure showed the architecture of NS

1074
00:55:48,869 --> 00:55:55,619
planner and we skip some parts and focus

1075
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:59,450
on the three main functionalities and we

1076
00:55:55,619 --> 00:56:02,460
will start talking about the the

1077
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:05,730
functionality that is performed by this

1078
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,810
model they go oriented polish management

1079
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:14,220
model and this model enable one to

1080
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:18,180
describe store and maintain go policies

1081
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:20,040
and for this we propose it these discs

1082
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:25,710
agreement there's this language

1083
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:29,220
agreement and basically summarizing one

1084
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:31,320
goal applies for one or more visual

1085
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,720
nature functions of I specifically

1086
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,970
network service and of course we can

1087
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:42,419
define one or more service attributes

1088
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:45,569
for this goal and the response it is

1089
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:48,839
also possible to define the degree of

1090
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:50,930
importance of this go as high medium or

1091
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,930
low

1092
00:56:53,140 --> 00:57:01,060
disfiguring illustrate how on complainer

1093
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:04,089
enable one to describe a go policies but

1094
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:08,070
I want to get deeper here in the

1095
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:11,620
interest of time just to lift straight

1096
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:14,650
this second functionary that I want to

1097
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:17,049
discuss with you is the policy

1098
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:18,910
refinement procedure II and there is

1099
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:23,320
perform at by the planet generation

1100
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:26,440
model and once I go require a gory find

1101
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:31,060
many requires arrives to the system this

1102
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:35,320
modeling work as follows the first step

1103
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:40,000
it study its instant heat our copy of on

1104
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:42,490
top laner in a memory and it distracts

1105
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,370
the curity state of the domain and they

1106
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:47,500
requested to go information all this

1107
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:50,920
information are stored in the on top

1108
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:53,830
laner and then after that it builds a

1109
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,550
planning problem dot met in Lisp code I

1110
00:57:53,830 --> 00:58:01,270
will talk I will talk about more later

1111
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:04,150
and it used this plenty problem domain

1112
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:08,920
model and a preview lose definite

1113
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:12,310
planning domain as he put for an

1114
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:14,590
eighteen planner in order to perform the

1115
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:18,940
planning process that is basically

1116
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:22,180
policy the policy refinement and once

1117
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:27,150
the the planning process and it created

1118
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:27,149
a first of all policies using it outputs

1119
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:33,430
and it stored these enforceable policies

1120
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:37,840
into the on top lane a copy

1121
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:41,770
finally it performs dl reason to provide

1122
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:47,170
constants verification this in consists

1123
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:49,390
this dis check is performed in order to

1124
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:50,980
detect if the states constraints I'll

1125
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:54,339
cross it okay

1126
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:56,290
and if the there are no in constants the

1127
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:58,720
enforceable policies are extracted from

1128
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:04,570
the on tone plane a copy and return it

1129
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:05,680
to the usage API move on this figure

1130
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:09,450
illustrates how the

1131
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:12,540
enable the creation of policies they are

1132
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:18,578
basically if it condition action rules

1133
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:22,329
okay again I I want gatekeeper I would

1134
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:25,390
get deeper in this context because we

1135
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:28,030
have a short time and continuing the

1136
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:29,920
last functionary I want to discuss with

1137
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:33,000
you is the detection of volleys

1138
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:36,839
conflicts name it policy analysis and

1139
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:40,210
it's worth mention that policy analysis

1140
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:44,950
requirement for policy refinement

1141
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:50,290
systems and to achieve its functionality

1142
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:54,308
we created two as double air rules one

1143
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:57,970
for to detect go conflicts and another

1144
00:59:54,309 --> 01:00:03,640
to detect the echo rule the enforceable

1145
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:06,970
policy conflicts in this context we can

1146
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:10,808
perform the detection of Polish

1147
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:14,049
conflicts that the detection of pulse

1148
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:19,140
complete is carry out through dialing

1149
01:00:14,049 --> 01:00:24,579
constants DL constants verification when

1150
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:31,170
originally is real reliable so if there

1151
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:34,089
are constants the reason we identify the

1152
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:40,630
the arrows and provide the possible

1153
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:44,078
explanations so we develop an NS planet

1154
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:45,700
prototype in Java and basically it use

1155
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:50,829
the spring boots implement the rest for

1156
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:53,710
api's and the auto WL API in order to

1157
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:56,079
enable the auto planning management and

1158
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:59,260
the conflict that they conflict

1159
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,250
detection mode we use the Amity reason a

1160
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:05,859
fully compliant

1161
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:10,359
Sado wl2 reasoner and the plenty

1162
01:01:05,859 --> 01:01:14,170
management model use the top - well

1163
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:17,020
found an ATM planner that is pertinent

1164
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:19,360
by university of maryland and of course

1165
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:22,180
in order to validate the NS play

1166
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:25,660
we implemented a use case that is

1167
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:29,649
basically a plain domain model for the

1168
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:33,819
resilience attribute and this figure

1169
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:37,600
here sure show parts of the test the

1170
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:43,960
composition of their resilience goal and

1171
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:47,589
I'd like to highlight two sub goals that

1172
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:53,010
are the failure prevented and a failure

1173
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:58,900
controlling the the foreman focus in

1174
01:01:53,010 --> 01:02:03,220
setting redundancy and out scale

1175
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:05,470
mechanism inside the NFIP mono and FA

1176
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:10,569
the the the ladder the failure is

1177
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:17,830
controlling focus on setting some

1178
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:21,540
healing mechanisms we we also conducted

1179
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:21,540
a performance evaluation

1180
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:27,460
I'm not going deeper than the results

1181
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:29,529
but Verizon an s planner performs in

1182
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:43,030
scale as well as the autologous size

1183
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:45,610
grow and these results in able to to

1184
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:48,760
indicate the DNS planet as an

1185
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:52,810
appropriate is appropriated to be use it

1186
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:55,060
in our production environment as an

1187
01:02:52,810 --> 01:03:00,700
auxiliary tool for an FF e mono

1188
01:02:55,060 --> 01:03:04,000
frameworks and we believe that this work

1189
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:07,390
leverage two contributions to an emoji

1190
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,880
the first one in s planet enable

1191
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:12,819
oriented policy refinement and this

1192
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,370
contest an Esplanade focus on entity

1193
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:17,080
specifically aspects since go policies

1194
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:19,359
described is already states in our

1195
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:23,980
environment are a sequence of actions

1196
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:26,200
and finally we believe that an S planner

1197
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:28,990
provides a decomposition logic to

1198
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:31,899
resolve intents to relevant service and

1199
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:35,439
select appropriate management functions

1200
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:37,470
and that's it does anyone have any

1201
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,470
questions

1202
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:57,609
hello developers a few questions first

1203
01:03:52,779 --> 01:04:03,519
one is when you show the the resolution

1204
01:03:57,609 --> 01:04:06,339
and and the oncologists do they apply to

1205
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:11,258
I mean to the initial planning orders

1206
01:04:06,339 --> 01:04:15,160
you are making making a re resolution

1207
01:04:11,259 --> 01:04:18,519
for for some kind of service assurance I

1208
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:21,460
don't know if you understand but what I

1209
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:23,258
mean is that you do it once when you are

1210
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:25,180
planning with with the man who is going

1211
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:29,170
to deploy the service of you repeated

1212
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:34,690
regularly for for taking decisions on a

1213
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:39,279
scale a scaling out or things basically

1214
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:43,029
the solution at this presentation just a

1215
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:45,460
short view of the entire solution so we

1216
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:49,450
have another mechanisms to perform this

1217
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:54,549
replay nning was this dissolution

1218
01:04:49,450 --> 01:05:00,390
detects that some policies are not

1219
01:04:54,549 --> 01:05:03,239
working properly and besides these

1220
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:07,769
disciplinary process generates some

1221
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:10,509
enforceable alarms that can detect any

1222
01:05:07,769 --> 01:05:16,839
problem in during the the infrastructure

1223
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:22,150
and of course it applies the the correct

1224
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:24,759
the corrective actions but the repair

1225
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:28,089
process is performing but it's another

1226
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:30,400
part of the work motivation just to be

1227
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:36,160
clear when you talk about planning here

1228
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:38,109
I mean planning is we consider that the

1229
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,629
planning process is similar to the

1230
01:05:38,109 --> 01:05:45,029
policy refund we considered the policy

1231
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:48,300
refinement is a kind of planning problem

1232
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:51,480
and here we use that's the composition

1233
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:55,320
that is basically we have a high level

1234
01:05:51,480 --> 01:06:02,700
go we only you can decompose in how many

1235
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:05,760
tested to you what and basically we

1236
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,859
planning means that you can verify if

1237
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,190
the policy are are working properly and

1238
01:06:07,859 --> 01:06:13,380
if doesn't you can replace by formed a

1239
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:15,510
idea how do you verify that the police

1240
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:18,000
is not yeah yeah I have another system

1241
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:20,369
that to this okay and you're going to

1242
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,750
present it today you know no no but if

1243
01:06:20,369 --> 01:06:24,869
you want to get Scott Slater

1244
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:28,200
no definitely and yes just a question

1245
01:06:24,869 --> 01:06:30,900
because you I see so three three inputs

1246
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:33,240
I mean you mentioned the operator and

1247
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:39,359
twice the orchestrator to two different

1248
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:42,779
modules let me see little bit that's

1249
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:47,190
where no no here so you have the

1250
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:50,580
operator provides some pretzels the nav

1251
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:52,470
Orchestrator provides any goals to this

1252
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:58,619
goal happy and at the end to the plan

1253
01:06:52,470 --> 01:07:02,310
area yeah in in if I consider I might be

1254
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:05,310
detest the entire work we I propose it

1255
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:07,440
the operator can can define a predefined

1256
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:08,549
alarms that will be created in the end

1257
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,330
of the planning process

1258
01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:15,390
okay understand we proposed it extent an

1259
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:17,670
NF if York is treated in order that we

1260
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:20,580
can define this goes inside the network

1261
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:23,099
service descriptor and it will be

1262
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:26,759
responsible for track this goes and then

1263
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:31,140
storing the using the NS planner okay so

1264
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:33,390
basic basically each network service at

1265
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:36,420
each NATO service comes with a set of

1266
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:40,020
goals yes what that ego applies just to

1267
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:43,020
one network service you just need to

1268
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,880
define for each and we don't do it for

1269
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:46,650
us and in the planning do you consider

1270
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:50,520
possessive interaction among the

1271
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:53,640
different NS goals or not the

1272
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:56,070
interactions I mean do you mean if I

1273
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,799
prefer yeah I have a network service

1274
01:07:56,070 --> 01:08:01,160
that is saying

1275
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:02,960
has as a goal use as much bandwidth as

1276
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,660
possible and there is another natural

1277
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:09,980
service that has as a goal use half of

1278
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:12,140
the bandwidth available for example do

1279
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:15,670
you consider that they are requesting

1280
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:18,700
things that probably are conflicting Oh

1281
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:22,609
as I mentioned I defined these rules

1282
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:24,830
where I can find conflicts between all

1283
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:27,170
those that are storied that are

1284
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:31,160
registered in the Delta planner and

1285
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:32,600
basically were at water check here if

1286
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:35,599
let me see her

1287
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:38,630
that's better if there are at least two

1288
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:42,799
goes that applies to the same network

1289
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:44,720
servers and intersects with but that

1290
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:48,859
apply to the same network service or

1291
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:51,529
that they apply to the same magnitude in

1292
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:53,839
the network because it's not the same to

1293
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:58,990
the same network service but I went to

1294
01:08:53,839 --> 01:09:01,818
that active here that I will don't have

1295
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:04,670
duplicate enforceable policies for

1296
01:09:01,819 --> 01:09:09,140
example if I have a network service and

1297
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:12,230
I defined two goals that could same

1298
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:16,310
patrol a choke functions probably when I

1299
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:18,349
generate that the final plan don't move

1300
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:22,609
another strike maybe Diego is mentioning

1301
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:26,390
more if you have goals conflict between

1302
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:31,180
different network services not no no no

1303
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:34,069
no services I just check if

1304
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:36,380
apply to the same network service so is

1305
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:43,819
not let's say this is not multi-tenant

1306
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:45,680
yet basically okay just very minor

1307
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:47,930
clarification question because in your

1308
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:51,529
your presentation you have some acronyms

1309
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:54,440
just to clarify when you say DL it's a

1310
01:09:51,529 --> 01:09:57,760
description logic yeah yeah yeah okay

1311
01:09:54,440 --> 01:10:03,710
yeah and HTN it's a your article tasks

1312
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:07,280
what's HTM in a TN is performing a TNS

1313
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:10,530
the the planning system no HTN in the in

1314
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:18,909
the task decomposition I think

1315
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:24,159
connects up next next okay see the

1316
01:10:18,909 --> 01:10:26,980
planner use shop to as HTN yes I choose

1317
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:29,379
it to I decided we decided to work with

1318
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:33,099
an eighteen planner is this automated

1319
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:36,610
planning system well in which we can

1320
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:41,440
define up planing domain model in a

1321
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:43,480
plane any problem and it these two

1322
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:47,530
models are using as input for this

1323
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:50,500
planar and but based on what you define

1324
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:52,330
there do you it it to you generate a

1325
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:53,409
plane a sequence of reactions that you

1326
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:57,340
have to perform okay

1327
01:10:53,409 --> 01:11:01,239
what does HTN mean a TN is it's a kind

1328
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:03,610
of automated system planning it is

1329
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:06,449
different from the classical planning it

1330
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:10,230
is wasted in task the composition that

1331
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:18,519
we believe that is better to work it's

1332
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:26,619
it's it's more CLE clear about how human

1333
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:30,280
feels so basically and we need we need

1334
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:32,199
something that from this this kind of

1335
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,000
test the composition because we don't

1336
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:37,259
want to define just a sequence of

1337
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,929
actions and generate a planning based on

1338
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:44,110
their preconditions and effects we want

1339
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:47,230
something that we can start for from

1340
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:52,599
high level tasks and then generate just

1341
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:56,468
the actions that okay I mean there exist

1342
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:58,270
order paper in the literature for task

1343
01:11:56,469 --> 01:12:00,750
decomposition and operation

1344
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:04,770
operationalization of policies of young

1345
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:09,429
also do you have some related work yeah

1346
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:11,949
this work is created this work is under

1347
01:12:09,429 --> 01:12:15,909
submission for the a triple transaction

1348
01:12:11,949 --> 01:12:21,000
actual working so I have a lot of

1349
01:12:15,909 --> 01:12:23,799
material if you want to know more about

1350
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,530
the related works and how they

1351
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:30,909
they tell you the entire solution works

1352
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:33,909
we can discuss later no problem but we

1353
01:12:30,909 --> 01:12:35,589
have a lot of related words okay so I

1354
01:12:33,909 --> 01:12:38,199
think this work is quite interesting for

1355
01:12:35,590 --> 01:12:40,840
the topic of intern base networking in

1356
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:42,400
the research group I see that since you

1357
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:44,559
have already some implementation it

1358
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,799
could also fit with the practical aspect

1359
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:50,079
the tools I will encourage you to get in

1360
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,389
touch with the activity on this thing

1361
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:54,699
and you can also come a come to us to

1362
01:12:52,389 --> 01:12:57,130
know who to contact my question is also

1363
01:12:54,699 --> 01:12:58,629
from the more on the theoretical base

1364
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:01,389
because you are proposing some

1365
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:03,790
techniques to address the the golda

1366
01:13:01,389 --> 01:13:06,429
composition the the planning phase and I

1367
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:08,230
can see relationship with the lifecycle

1368
01:13:06,429 --> 01:13:10,690
so the different steps that we have for

1369
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:14,500
the intent we have also decomposition we

1370
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:17,650
have conflict resolution so I will also

1371
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:19,739
encourage you maybe to link with the the

1372
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:21,790
author or on the meaning list whatever

1373
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:24,250
so because I think you can propose

1374
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:26,309
things to refine our understanding of

1375
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:29,590
the the functionality and maybe also

1376
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:32,320
propose some suitable techniques okay

1377
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:35,770
for solving for being solutions to the

1378
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,980
different functionality okay I'm glad to

1379
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:41,150
contribute thank you thank you

1380

[Music]

1381
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:48,950
next speaker please Sabine

1382
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,950
[Music]

1383
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:16,390
so hello so I'll stop I'll stop the

1384
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:19,970
presentation by a use case that

1385
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:27,620
motivated this work on the over-the-top

1386
01:14:19,970 --> 01:14:33,200
intent based networking and sorry oh so

1387
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:36,230
can he is it better then a description

1388
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:41,450
of the framework we proposed the first

1389
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:46,759
conclusion and the challenges so the the

1390
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:49,970
the initial use case was this demo that

1391
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:54,050
involved several burlaps facility and

1392
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:59,390
this was about deploying slices for IOT

1393
01:14:54,050 --> 01:15:02,270
and EMB B of over a cloud run so as you

1394
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:12,260
can see you have already several types

1395
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:16,370
of clouds so and so the problem was that

1396
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:21,860
to have it up and running each time it

1397
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:24,290
was in requiring like one and a half to

1398
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:28,719
two hours of expert engineer and

1399
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:33,980
researcher configuration operation so

1400
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:36,920
when we looked at existing research in

1401
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:41,660
intent on intent based networking for

1402
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:45,190
those type of use cases we found out

1403
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:48,740
that as it is written in several drafts

1404
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:52,280
currently the current work at that time

1405
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:57,410
was focusing on policy the service was

1406
01:15:52,280 --> 01:16:00,099
connectivity and there was already there

1407
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:02,150
was that lack of languages to translate

1408
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,550
instruction from one system to another

1409
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:07,580
one

1410
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:09,890
so what we proposed is to extend the

1411
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:12,950
intent based networking from

1412
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:15,560
connectivity to applications from

1413
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:20,570
network operation to over the top

1414
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:23,720
application provisioning and from fixed

1415
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:27,110
network to more heterogeneous networks

1416
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:33,830
such as cellular width and the current

1417
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:36,889
focus on this work is to look at the

1418
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:40,480
intent request feasibility check we're

1419
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:42,860
not working this work is not about

1420
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:47,440
translating and natural language

1421
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:51,440
processing and stuff like that and also

1422
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:55,429
the the other focus is on intent Network

1423
01:16:51,440 --> 01:17:01,610
application slice automation so this is

1424
01:16:55,430 --> 01:17:04,070
the framework so I tried bit between the

1425
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:08,599
two versions I uploaded I try to play

1426
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:11,509
with some colors to map it with the work

1427
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:19,480
that draft on intent based concepts

1428
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:24,560
so this sorry so the so the functions

1429
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:30,820
this is the architecture framework for

1430
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:34,430
the intent based the in OTT intent sorry

1431
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:39,889
and this was already here the only thing

1432
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:44,990
I did was adding the outlines so we have

1433
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:47,780
already this space here so in the draft

1434
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:52,760
you have the this is why I took my paper

1435
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:55,840
the user space here and this the

1436
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:59,930
functionality of the use of space as

1437
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:03,590
indicated they interact with the user so

1438
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:06,530
this one takes in the application slice

1439
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:11,300
request this one provides system

1440
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:15,920
feedback and this is a key function to

1441
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:18,080
in our vision because this makes the

1442
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:22,120
difference between a Gillian and

1443
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:28,220
then stuff it it is this system feedback

1444
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:31,610
that the user gets this is the history

1445
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:34,940
ASI stands for application slice instant

1446
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:39,429
so these stores like what happened the

1447
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:42,889
name and and whether it was interrupted

1448
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:44,630
status and this is some dashboard that

1449
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:46,880
is exposed to the user

1450
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:50,810
given that of course underneath the

1451
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:56,950
dashboard you have more system no lower

1452
01:18:50,810 --> 01:19:01,130
level computation this is what is called

1453
01:18:56,950 --> 01:19:02,030
the this is the core IBM framework

1454
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:05,780
functions

1455
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:12,490
so these function Maps the intent

1456
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:16,360
requests to a first a first level of

1457
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:20,030
what is called service graph it's a

1458
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:23,210
graph of the the main function that

1459
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:25,519
needs to be that needs to run to perform

1460
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:27,770
the service so this is not yet talking

1461
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:31,880
about how many replicas and stuff like

1462
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:35,180
that this is like a blueprints so so you

1463
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:39,160
have this initial graph and upon this

1464
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:43,330
initial graph before ever going

1465
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:46,430
continuing the first thing is that given

1466
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:50,570
once you know what function you need to

1467
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:53,330
run your service you should be able and

1468
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:56,210
once you know of course what application

1469
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:59,990
you want to run once you also know the

1470
01:19:56,210 --> 01:20:03,920
population of your application which

1471
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:07,099
means how many endpoints for example you

1472
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:10,160
should be able to provide a first level

1473
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:12,200
of dimensioning so this is not there's

1474
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:14,960
nothing new there there's lots of

1475
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:17,830
literature and studies and online

1476
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:20,180
learning system data driven

1477
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:26,180
functionalities to help you have a

1478
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:30,710
coarse grain dimensioning so before ever

1479
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:32,130
continuing used you have to check the

1480
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:35,400
resources available

1481
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:38,699
whether your infrastructure is able to

1482
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:43,679
deploy the necessary functions so to do

1483
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:48,259
so you so you go through this function

1484
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:51,000
and this function is fed by other

1485
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:54,810
functionalities that compute the

1486
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,050
dimensioning and that computed based on

1487
01:20:54,810 --> 01:21:02,040
patterns and where these patterns are

1488
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:06,000
based on system measurements so this is

1489
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:11,659
like some classical loop but we feel

1490
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:15,540
that it is very important for a reliable

1491
01:21:11,659 --> 01:21:20,070
intent-based system to have already at

1492
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:24,239
this stage this check because if this

1493
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:27,480
does not work your intent will never be

1494
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:31,080
fulfilled and you will the risk is to

1495
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:33,239
run steps here unnecessarily to lose

1496
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:34,199
time whereas if you check this

1497
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:36,870
immediately

1498
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:40,710
you just have a system feedback and say

1499
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:45,690
for example no not enough resources or

1500
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:51,679
other reasons I am this does not cover

1501
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:56,699
the no go on ok from the system due to

1502
01:21:51,679 --> 01:22:00,750
access right our policy user policy okay

1503
01:21:56,699 --> 01:22:05,159
so once you have once your you have the

1504
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:08,370
ok regarding the resources the systems

1505
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:12,629
the system computes the deployment plan

1506
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:16,800
so you know theoretically that you have

1507
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:18,659
several classes of servers on which you

1508
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,719
can deploy your functions and this

1509
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:24,780
functionality computes the deployment

1510
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:28,920
plan so this I will not detail this what

1511
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:33,469
this will be presented in December in

1512
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:39,330
Dropcam and then once this is finished

1513
01:22:33,469 --> 01:22:41,159
so the system generates the ibis control

1514
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:44,969
commands where Ibis stands for

1515
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:46,000
intent-based application slicing so the

1516
01:22:44,969 --> 01:22:49,050
system genera

1517
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:53,550
it's the commands it can also

1518
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:57,400
progressively have several sets of

1519
01:22:53,550 --> 01:23:01,840
commands that map to given sets of

1520
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:04,230
instruction and then once it is ready

1521
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:07,120
these commands are sent to this

1522
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:10,839
functionality which is the iPass control

1523
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:14,590
this work function and the other blue

1524
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:20,590
function belong to the network operation

1525
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:24,310
space and in this framework I also have

1526
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:28,260
outlined here are the the blocks in

1527
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:31,810
different colors and this corresponds to

1528
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:36,240
intent fulfillment so intent fulfillment

1529
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:40,450
is the block for intent fulfillment are

1530
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:44,250
surrounded by grey with grey and the

1531
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:51,570
function the function blocks for intent

1532
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:55,480
assurance are surrounded with blue so

1533
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:59,290
once the instructions already they are

1534
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:03,480
sent to the iPass control and this

1535
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:08,170
entity is able to talk to all the

1536
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:09,719
management functions so the the intent

1537
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:14,980
framework here

1538
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:18,070
hence over the action and the commands

1539
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:25,360
to control functions that's where the

1540
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:28,809
intent scope stops in in all other

1541
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:32,139
proposed view for ott intents and here

1542
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:37,360
you can see that you have something that

1543
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:40,270
is named live intent because the one

1544
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:43,240
main implementation for Sdn controller

1545
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:47,380
is on us and you have this famous ad on

1546
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:50,380
us intensive which are encapsulate s--

1547
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:54,250
quite complex computation for

1548
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:58,060
connectivity but in our sense here for

1549
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:59,249
ott it can be considered as too

1550
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:03,420
technical

1551
01:24:59,249 --> 01:25:05,639
because somebody who requests a costumer

1552
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:08,989
who requests to deploy a slice for I

1553
01:25:05,639 --> 01:25:12,150
don't know agriculture has no clue of a

1554
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:12,598
hostname and port number and stuff like

1555
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:17,098
that

1556
01:25:12,599 --> 01:25:20,849
but the system here at this layer at

1557
01:25:17,099 --> 01:25:24,749
this level this function is able to talk

1558
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:28,070
to other controllers and this one this

1559
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:31,679
one function does have the skills to

1560
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:38,308
express an intent which is much more

1561
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:40,650
technical and these technical intent can

1562
01:25:38,309 --> 01:25:45,150
also seem very abstract to the

1563
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:48,929
southbound of a controller so just the

1564
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:53,670
the first conclusion of this framework

1565
01:25:48,929 --> 01:25:56,519
is that already we already have the

1566
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:58,920
complexity although this is considered

1567
01:25:56,519 --> 01:26:03,179
as a basic example because you just have

1568
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:11,909
one request that is expressed on the

1569
01:26:03,179 --> 01:26:13,979
northbound ok so I will rush so this is

1570
01:26:11,909 --> 01:26:17,308
the proposed framework and how it fits

1571
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:21,389
to with the concepts and what we think

1572
01:26:17,309 --> 01:26:24,059
we should be added so basically control

1573
01:26:21,389 --> 01:26:27,570
function that warranty that you have

1574
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:30,479
their availability resources and also at

1575
01:26:27,570 --> 01:26:35,400
this level verification and validation

1576
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:38,610
and for example so I'll skip this this

1577
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:42,749
is how the the intent is expressed using

1578
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:46,289
just parameters a parametric model so

1579
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:49,320
typically regarding the assurance the

1580
01:26:46,289 --> 01:26:51,630
validation is done here by just

1581
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:54,449
verifying the traffic it can be done in

1582
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:57,989
two-way verifying that the traffic is

1583
01:26:54,449 --> 01:27:00,900
flowing and that the expected traffic

1584
01:26:57,989 --> 01:27:06,388
pattern regarding growth for example a

1585
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:12,150
scalability is respected another way of

1586
01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:13,200
where validation or assure another

1587
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:15,870
assurance function

1588
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:20,309
is to verify that there is no problem

1589
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:27,210
with a with the resources consumption

1590
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:29,670
and so here so and this and that this is

1591
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:32,910
to validate the dimensioning rules that

1592
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:37,860
have been used and the last function

1593
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:40,230
here is to verify just make a pose we

1594
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:42,599
are starting to run late again I think I

1595
01:27:40,230 --> 01:27:46,589
think that as a criticism early on that

1596
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:48,330
ethic just a question so you ask you a

1597
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:52,020
question you answer quickly and then I

1598
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:59,700
think you need to rush to the okay what

1599
01:27:52,020 --> 01:28:04,350
is emergence traffic one more slide back

1600
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:07,740
yeah what is emergence traffic it's big

1601
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:09,230
bursts of traffic emergency uh-oh sorry

1602
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:15,510
yeah

1603
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:19,250
this is a typo I'm sorry yeah okay so

1604
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:23,010
okay so this is another another way of

1605
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:26,570
valid a buddy dating the system there I

1606
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:29,100
think there is a need for specifying

1607
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:32,610
validation functions at several level

1608
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:35,520
even looking at the how long you take so

1609
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:39,690
by the way the set up time was like a

1610
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:43,770
couple of minutes even if this is very

1611
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:49,200
system specific of course this can be

1612
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:53,790
used again to verify that the the slice

1613
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:57,510
has been correctly deployed so matching

1614
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:59,970
this again against expected results and

1615
01:28:57,510 --> 01:29:02,670
this is something that is very that was

1616
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:05,220
discussed in Montreal as well this is

1617
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:07,440
something that is very useful I think in

1618
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:11,910
this intent framework and in the work

1619
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:15,780
that is being defined here is define

1620
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:18,750
some targets and look at what happens

1621
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:21,690
and compare maybe adjusting the target

1622
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:25,620
but now and then decide should I adjust

1623
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:27,450
my system should I adjust my target so

1624
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:30,900
the challenge is here

1625
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:33,300
is that okay this was a very basic

1626
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:36,089
example although very complex because

1627
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:39,570
involving several clouds or classes of

1628
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:44,340
clouds and several functions but this is

1629
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:52,200
basic and we we believe that in real

1630
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:54,720
life the the system the deployments are

1631
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:56,580
much more complex you in real life you

1632
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:58,830
have several you have a constellation

1633
01:29:56,580 --> 01:30:02,070
you may have a constellation of such

1634
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:03,990
deployments and the the big I mean there

1635
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:07,049
is a lot of work still to be done on

1636
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:11,570
what I just presented but the big

1637
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:14,550
concern is what happens if I have a

1638
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:18,210
several such system interacting with

1639
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:21,600
themselves what happens if for example I

1640
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:23,970
talked to several controllers to five

1641
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:26,730
different implementation of controllers

1642
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:31,500
so there's a lot of work that is needed

1643
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:35,040
to be able to to send correctly my

1644
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:38,370
instruction to these controls how do I

1645
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:45,330
know that the controlling function I

1646
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:49,349
talked to has understood my my request

1647
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:53,550
and how do I expose how how can

1648
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:56,460
different system expose a request that

1649
01:30:53,550 --> 01:30:59,490
can be at some point not immediately but

1650
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:03,180
at some point understood by all system

1651
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:05,280
and you can have you can look at the

1652
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:12,080
feedback slides if you like if you like

1653
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:20,130
some more details so I think I am done

1654
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:22,320
okay quick comment please well I first

1655
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:25,740
of all I like the acronym do you know

1656
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:31,290
what I see means paying I see you know

1657
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:33,719
what I see it's application slicing no

1658
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:39,210
no but I mean in Spanish when do we say

1659
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:40,890
it means this way so I like it just know

1660
01:31:39,210 --> 01:31:43,080
yeah and now with the

1661
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:45,690
and another thing that I like is that

1662
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,430
you mentioned topology here because it's

1663
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:49,469
something that I have always believed is

1664
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:54,530
essential and composition that's two

1665
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:54,530
things that let me let me go to my notes

1666
01:31:57,950 --> 01:32:01,830
if we have running out of time there's a

1667
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:05,580
question

1668
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:09,480
drew are defining as a slice the unit

1669
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:11,370
for intent right it's basically this but

1670
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,580
you have not defined the slash you just

1671
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:19,410
say is the application of slice intent

1672
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:24,090
how do you define a slice okay the slice

1673
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:27,380
is the set of cloud and network

1674
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:30,240
resources that is allocated to run this

1675
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:36,320
this application I mean in this it was

1676
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:39,240
very basic and typically the slice was

1677
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:41,460
specified by the chain of functions and

1678
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:45,179
replicas that we use to run this

1679
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:47,640
application and together with the budget

1680
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:50,070
of infrastructure resources

1681
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:55,740
okay so is computing plus Network

1682
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:57,540
end-to-end application okay so I would

1683
01:32:55,740 --> 01:33:01,139
not use the term OTT but that's another

1684
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:02,640
story that's yeah this sounds a little

1685
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:05,400
bit that verse our deal with anyway

1686
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:07,740
that's yeah maybe I may change the

1687
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:13,460
terminology the point was that the

1688
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:13,460
tenant is supposed to be a customer

1689
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:21,150
already we use it in vertical so we

1690
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:25,380
calls and that's well and the rest I

1691
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:27,990
will keep talking about this okay

1692
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:31,950
they are morons I have a you're

1693
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:33,929
mentioning slice but I would I'm not

1694
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:36,389
very interested in the intent on the

1695
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:38,100
service topology then actually on the

1696
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:42,170
slice I could have multiple different

1697
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:42,170
service apologies within a single slice

1698
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,690
can you repeat so when I deploy a

1699
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:48,660
service

1700
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:50,460
I'm creating a service topology and I

1701
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:53,040
can have multiple service topology

1702
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:54,670
within a certain slice because the slice

1703
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:59,769
is defining me in the ministry

1704
01:33:54,670 --> 01:34:01,480
domaine but the actual service will be

1705
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:04,900
defined you know by the application on

1706
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:07,120
top of the service topology yes I'm you

1707
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:09,160
know viewing the slides just as an

1708
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:17,910
administrative domain a set of resources

1709
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:19,900
that is given to a to a an entity to

1710
01:34:17,910 --> 01:34:25,660
have control over that

1711
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:30,040
I completely agree and I see your point

1712
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:33,400
this presentation completely skips the

1713
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:36,910
aspect of whether I would call the

1714
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:39,280
definition set of the application that

1715
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:43,599
definition set of the intent that's yet

1716
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:46,719
another issue to to tackle but so in

1717
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:50,260
this presentation yes indeed we only

1718
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:54,969
consider we well this is a very basic

1719
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:58,150
example and we on purpose we started

1720
01:34:54,969 --> 01:35:02,020
like a zero point with no complexity

1721
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:05,830
regarding where do I deploy this and we

1722
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:08,980
and the as I said the the definition set

1723
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:11,739
the topology up abstraction and what you

1724
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:14,080
can already request and have as

1725
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:16,360
constraint regarding the topology where

1726
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:19,900
you I mean the infrastructure when you

1727
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:23,400
want to deploy your service that's yet

1728
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:23,400
another problem ok

1729
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:36,750
[Music]

1730
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:47,650
thank you all right the pink cross be

1731
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:49,179
difficult not to move but okay so what I

1732
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:51,639
want to present here this is service

1733
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:52,960
assurance for intent-based networking so

1734
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:55,450
words come from

1735
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:59,080
at the last Montreal meeting we spend

1736
01:35:55,450 --> 01:36:02,019
like a day of any margin intent and I

1737
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:04,540
say to explain a couple of concept there

1738
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:07,350
in the end I wrote the slide about it

1739
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:11,650
the way we have to understand this is

1740
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:13,900
okay if we want we want to use to what

1741
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:16,000
you do service assurance other as a way

1742
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:17,889
to do close the automation and maybe

1743
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,540
solve the antenna later that's the way

1744
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:24,030
you have to understand that I presented

1745
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:27,550
those two draft in upset ability already

1746
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:30,160
so the issue that that we have is that

1747
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:32,440
okay we configure a service as an

1748
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:35,530
operator great it's configure it doesn't

1749
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:37,509
mean it works correctly then we're

1750
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:39,519
telling we could be sending all the

1751
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:42,190
telemetry you know data like he do

1752
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:45,550
machine learning etc and we've got the

1753
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:48,400
issue of the needle in the haystack what

1754
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:52,330
are we trying to do operators they want

1755
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:56,379
you know one or service degrades where

1756
01:36:52,330 --> 01:36:58,030
is the fault and it could be an easy one

1757
01:36:56,380 --> 01:36:59,710
like the faces down this is the root

1758
01:36:58,030 --> 01:37:01,420
Coast but most of the time we need to

1759
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:03,940
have the centum of what's happening and

1760
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:06,190
we to do some more analysis the second

1761
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:09,099
thing I'd like to do is when a network

1762
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:11,650
component fails which service are

1763
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:15,370
impacted typical data center issue of a

1764
01:37:11,650 --> 01:37:19,530
D&C CMP issue and we've got no clue what

1765
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:22,620
the services are which one are impacted

1766
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:25,630
so we know the end goal would be like

1767
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:27,730
self-driving self-healing networks with

1768
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:29,580
the closed loop automation we could take

1769
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:31,750
a top-down approach the creative way

1770
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:34,269
it's a nice concept but that works

1771
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:36,730
mainly for a Greenfield deployment and

1772
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:39,220
in my world of operators well it's not

1773
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:42,250
that easy so let's try to service

1774
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:44,380
differently by trying to decompose the

1775
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:45,970
the issue of assertions into smaller

1776
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:47,980
components

1777
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:51,280
trying to assure those smaller

1778
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:54,129
components one by one now if we combine

1779
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:56,259
his approach with the end-to-end cinetic

1780
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:59,140
traffic test then we have a complete

1781
01:37:56,260 --> 01:38:02,620
view of the disservice if we only take

1782
01:37:59,140 --> 01:38:04,810
the synthetic traffic then we have a

1783
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:07,120
kind of black box view of the network

1784
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:08,950
we've got no clue where the issue is and

1785
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:10,690
we need to drill down into the different

1786
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:14,080
components and assure them and to know

1787
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:17,019
where where it is so a couple of

1788
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:19,269
concepts in the draft so the concept of

1789
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:22,150
the assurance graph where we've got like

1790
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:24,970
a service which is source instance sorry

1791
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:27,820
which is decomposed into sub services

1792
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:30,760
typically for a very simple example here

1793
01:38:27,820 --> 01:38:32,950
a tunnel that depends on both sources

1794
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:35,080
Nishant or interfaces that depends on

1795
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:37,540
physical interfaces that depend the

1796
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:39,820
respective devices right and same thing

1797
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:45,370
for connectivity so if you could assured

1798
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:49,240
those subservice types right then we

1799
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:52,000
could infer the the score the highest

1800
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:54,519
score of the service and we could also

1801
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:59,920
report a series of symptoms up to the

1802
01:38:54,520 --> 01:39:04,000
health of the of the service now for

1803
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:06,490
that obviously in an assurance graph we

1804
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,580
have like two type of dependencies the

1805
01:39:06,490 --> 01:39:11,860
one that are impacting well if the

1806
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:16,350
device is down obviously interface is

1807
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:19,360
down to nourish down and etc if the

1808
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:22,750
interface is down same thing so these

1809
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:25,900
are the easy ones what is more

1810
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:28,770
interesting is maybe not more

1811
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:31,330
interesting but the most applicable is

1812
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:33,160
informational dependencies who are in

1813
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:35,740
this example I just put ecmp

1814
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:38,410
right so I've got the multiple paths in

1815
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:41,290
my EMP group and then one of them is

1816
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:44,170
buddy behaving is my service impacted

1817
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:45,490
what it depends is the answer that's why

1818
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:49,120
we have this as informational

1819
01:39:45,490 --> 01:39:52,389
dependencies so what we knew so far if

1820
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:53,590
we know the Ashwin's graph and if we

1821
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:56,650
know the house of the different

1822
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:59,290
components in there we know were default

1823
01:39:56,650 --> 01:40:01,660
s or at least to start with were its

1824
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:03,970
not because everything is Halcyon green

1825
01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:07,269
except a couple of points we could start

1826
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:08,950
by investigating those components we

1827
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:11,740
know also the symptom for the root cause

1828
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:13,420
now because I've got the three in one

1829
01:40:11,740 --> 01:40:15,010
direction I've got it also in the

1830
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:17,350
reverse direction which is something

1831
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:19,720
interesting I see this component my

1832
01:40:17,350 --> 01:40:21,910
network is failing or degrading and I

1833
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:25,750
know the impact on all the services that

1834
01:40:21,910 --> 01:40:28,450
are configured now this is the

1835
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:30,580
architecture let me quickly go over it

1836
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:32,650
we've got like a service configuration

1837
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:35,410
Orchestrator I made difference between

1838
01:40:32,650 --> 01:40:37,000
this one configuration and the one for

1839
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:39,550
assurance which is the sin of castrator

1840
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,320
so we extract the service and this is

1841
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:43,660
for us a starting point for the intent

1842
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:46,030
so we don't go from declarative right we

1843
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:49,240
try to extract it from the from the

1844
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:52,509
service now from there we did use the

1845
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:54,910
assurance graph and we go in this

1846
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:56,590
architecture with some agents that are

1847
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:59,050
doing the mapping between the graph

1848
01:40:56,590 --> 01:41:01,690
itself and the actual metrics that are

1849
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:06,100
occurring on the device or the devices

1850
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:09,519
and that that agent query so it creates

1851
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:11,380
like a health status which is composed

1852
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,930
of the score itself of each component

1853
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:16,480
and the symptoms and we send that via

1854
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:18,310
telemetry back to the configuration

1855
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:20,650
that's where we could do closed loop

1856
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:24,760
automation if we know exactly which sub

1857
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:26,650
component is is degrading so if we don't

1858
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:28,060
do it by component and we say okay the

1859
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:30,429
service is filling what do we do do we

1860
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:32,800
reconfigure it well not quite right

1861
01:41:30,430 --> 01:41:35,380
there are a situation between but this

1862
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:38,440
is the point now this is a flexible

1863
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:39,820
architecture were both orchestrators the

1864
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:43,179
one fresh trans configuration could

1865
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:46,660
obviously be the same box and same thing

1866
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:52,480
for the the agent which could be in the

1867
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:56,410
Box in the router or not now it's also

1868
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:58,719
it must be an open architecture right if

1869
01:41:56,410 --> 01:42:01,360
we solve this one for a single vendor

1870
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:04,810
great but not many networks every single

1871
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:06,969
vendor and how do we do this with a yang

1872
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:09,520
module obviously for me a yang mode

1873
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:11,710
using API and we can recommend this yang

1874
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,849
module for multiple service types and

1875
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:16,389
for vendors

1876
01:42:12,849 --> 01:42:18,909
cific information these are two arrows

1877
01:42:16,389 --> 01:42:22,210
in there in red that where we opened the

1878
01:42:18,909 --> 01:42:25,000
API we could read and configure the

1879
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:27,579
assurance tree and also we could send

1880
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,849
that telemetry to the score and there

1881
01:42:27,579 --> 01:42:34,619
are the symptoms what we're not doing

1882
01:42:30,849 --> 01:42:37,119
here is trying to get the kind of

1883
01:42:34,619 --> 01:42:39,940
standard ARS Orchestrator or open source

1884
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:42,309
Orchestrator and also the expression

1885
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:44,469
that are used to say this is how we we

1886
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:47,920
get the house of you know data plane is

1887
01:42:44,469 --> 01:42:51,250
is not in there but this actual

1888
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:53,110
architecture should be open so this is

1889
01:42:51,250 --> 01:42:55,179
the full yang module I don't want you to

1890
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:57,519
look at it this way but I want you to

1891
01:42:55,179 --> 01:43:00,579
just read it through Omni what is in

1892
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:02,980
blue there so even if you don't want to

1893
01:43:00,579 --> 01:43:05,530
go into details of Yang you want to

1894
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:09,129
understand that we are able to configure

1895
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:12,610
this tree and augment it right this

1896
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:17,199
assurance tree with multiple service

1897
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:18,848
types and that's a way to do it you want

1898
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:20,860
to understand from the yang module that

1899
01:43:18,849 --> 01:43:25,960
we could get the house score and

1900
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:28,869
symptoms per sub service type an ID and

1901
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:31,260
this is what we're going to push to to

1902
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:33,670
the character for the closely automation

1903
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:37,750
you want to understand from the yang

1904
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:40,500
module that you can create your own sub

1905
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:42,790
services with your own parameters

1906
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:44,500
obviously a parameters what is this if

1907
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:47,920
I'm doing the house of this device this

1908
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:50,170
device ID if I'm doing the health of an

1909
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:53,320
interface this is that interface on that

1910
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:55,929
device ID so the parameters will be

1911
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:59,679
different and finally you want to

1912
01:43:55,929 --> 01:44:02,290
understand that we could open this even

1913
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:05,829
with some vendor specific sub services

1914
01:44:02,290 --> 01:44:07,659
which in the end will happen anyway even

1915
01:44:05,829 --> 01:44:09,429
within a single vendor we have different

1916
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:14,440
platforms for example coming back this

1917
01:44:09,429 --> 01:44:16,239
an example of the device health and I

1918
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:18,669
think I've been fast enough as you want

1919
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:22,629
it to provide discussion which is more

1920
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:24,400
interesting so this is the time to to

1921
01:44:22,630 --> 01:44:26,710
discuss this and get your feedback I

1922
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:30,210
received quite some feedback already

1923
01:44:26,710 --> 01:44:32,830
from from operators in the ops aw gee so

1924
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:37,180
up to you now for more feedback if you

1925
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:44,830
want I love your questions as a

1926
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:47,320
participant I will see that the Asturian

1927
01:44:44,830 --> 01:44:49,690
graph can be used I mean you can map it

1928
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:52,150
into our internet life cycle in the

1929
01:44:49,690 --> 01:44:54,489
phase of your service where you want to

1930
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:55,989
you have already decomposed your intent

1931
01:44:54,489 --> 01:44:57,759
and you want to be able to monitor what

1932
01:44:55,989 --> 01:45:01,989
corresponds to an intern so to make the

1933
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:03,460
way up so I think this could be a we

1934
01:45:01,989 --> 01:45:05,320
could use that as an example of a

1935
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:07,600
technique that can be used to fulfill a

1936
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:09,360
step of the life cycle I think it's a

1937
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:13,030
valid contribution in that sense a

1938
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:15,070
question I would have is where do you

1939
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:16,960
see what do you do the relationship is

1940
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:19,360
the intent I mean the input intent I

1941
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:22,719
mean where would you with your proposal

1942
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,889
fit in a kind of intent architecture so

1943
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:27,060
I have to redo this version of your

1944
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:27,060
draft that for me okay

1945
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:31,960
my personal view and then the answer to

1946
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:35,530
your question I never liked the term

1947
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:38,469
intent because it's fuzzy to me at least

1948
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:42,519
when I speak to you to operators now

1949
01:45:38,469 --> 01:45:44,290
however I I take the beginning of an

1950
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:46,870
intent starting from the service

1951
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:48,880
definition which I get from the

1952
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:51,250
orchestrator configuring the service and

1953
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:55,480
most of the time those services are at a

1954
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:58,270
specific type I want to do an l2 VPN an

1955
01:45:55,480 --> 01:46:01,419
ultra P and I want to do that vnf and

1956
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:04,870
for a specific service type then we

1957
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:06,820
could just reduce from the configuration

1958
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:11,550
of it the start of the intent

1959
01:46:06,820 --> 01:46:13,179
make sense thank you

1960
01:46:11,550 --> 01:46:16,330
[Music]

1961
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:18,550
judgments your abstract there's a layer

1962
01:46:16,330 --> 01:46:20,980
that's missed it cannot be an intent or

1963
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:24,880
and l3 VPN l3 VPN is an implementation

1964
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:28,299
of intent so again there should be to

1965
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:32,110
your question layers that could consume

1966
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:35,530
internists coming from the user and tell

1967
01:46:32,110 --> 01:46:37,210
the the way data model is built look I

1968
01:46:35,530 --> 01:46:41,000
need you to implement particular intent

1969
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:44,150
as LCVP and our evpn or sometimes

1970
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,070
so I would agree with that someone need

1971
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:48,620
to maintain all the bindings and

1972
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:51,679
actually expose northbound what intent

1973
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:53,660
is and normalizing down to the data

1974
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:55,640
model but it should be in terms of

1975
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:57,769
instantiation I agree that's why I

1976
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,490
mentioned where the the Intendant could

1977
01:46:57,770 --> 01:47:00,800
be defined

1978
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:03,469
it's a vague term right it could be

1979
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:07,490
defined and user from the from the order

1980
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:10,310
from the SLA from this technology or I

1981
01:47:07,490 --> 01:47:12,139
don't even care energy so I would agree

1982
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:14,180
with that I wouldn't call it wake

1983
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:16,220
because you just bill kind of bottom

1984
01:47:14,180 --> 01:47:19,610
there and if you go bottom up you could

1985
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:22,030
start building bindings given on Ted of

1986
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:25,580
technologies that are available to our

1987
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:28,280
definition of service but in business

1988
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:34,610
terms not l3 VPN our villain terms I

1989
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:36,800
agree Alex trim yeah I think actually

1990
01:47:34,610 --> 01:47:38,480
the dependency graph and those sort of

1991
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:40,280
things I don't think it's specific it

1992
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:42,799
and clearly but I think it's more widely

1993
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:44,660
applicable but one question that I would

1994
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,460
have I think it raises the other day as

1995
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:48,500
well as actually how do you maintain

1996
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:50,600
this dependency graph I think this seems

1997
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:53,210
to be one of the key things that you

1998
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:55,310
basically yeah that you capture do you

1999
01:47:53,210 --> 01:47:56,540
basically establish them as part of the

2000
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:59,630
provisioning basically you have

2001
01:47:56,540 --> 01:48:01,370
basically additional operations there or

2002
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:02,660
do you discover them or how do you how

2003
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:04,490
do you maintain them and I think this

2004
01:48:02,660 --> 01:48:07,970
will be one of the practical issues

2005
01:48:04,490 --> 01:48:10,210
perhaps with this so it's both part of

2006
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:13,550
the configuration and both discovered

2007
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:16,430
you know if I take for example if I rely

2008
01:48:13,550 --> 01:48:18,380
on ecmp for service we're not going to

2009
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:21,260
configure a CMP part of a service right

2010
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:25,130
if we if we're depending on ice is or

2011
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:27,050
SPF we're not going to configure si as

2012
01:48:25,130 --> 01:48:29,780
part of a service definition is done by

2013
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:31,580
a different group right so it's part

2014
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:33,019
partly what you get from the search

2015
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:34,809
definition and what you get from a

2016
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:38,240
network and yes you have to maintain it

2017
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:40,250
and please we are a bit over time thank

2018
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:42,170
you Bruno and for the comments and the

2019
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:44,000
presentation but we would like to give

2020
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:45,980
also enough time for Dan to make his

2021
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,720
presentation if you have further

2022
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:51,849
questions please on the mailing list or

2023
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:51,850
after the session thank you

2024
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:11,489
cool thanks okay so 33.3% less time

2025
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:17,340
approximately great okay so I'm dropping

2026
01:49:11,489 --> 01:49:22,230
down a little bit from decorative slash

2027
01:49:17,340 --> 01:49:24,090
intent looking at imperative policy now

2028
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:26,940
this was a piece of work that was

2029
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:28,769
presented in net mod earlier this week

2030
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:30,239
so apologies if you attended that

2031
01:49:28,769 --> 01:49:34,320
session there's going to be some slight

2032
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:36,449
repetition here but just wait for the

2033
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:38,639
final slide and hopefully I'll try to

2034
01:49:36,449 --> 01:49:41,940
put the discussions the context of the

2035
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:44,239
nm RG so we don't really need to spend

2036
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:47,940
any time I think talking about ECA

2037
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:52,428
you're all sort of highly aware of flick

2038
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:55,638
ability of ECA for applying policy to

2039
01:49:52,429 --> 01:50:00,150
technology selection service deployment

2040
01:49:55,639 --> 01:50:02,340
may be resource usage just a reminder

2041
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:05,129
actually that for some of you you may be

2042
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:07,590
have been aware of a previous working

2043
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:10,679
group super simplified use policy

2044
01:50:07,590 --> 01:50:15,570
abstraction which look to sort of

2045
01:50:10,679 --> 01:50:18,900
harmonize some of the imperative policy

2046
01:50:15,570 --> 01:50:22,289
usage across various technologies in the

2047
01:50:18,900 --> 01:50:24,808
ITF unfortunately we never actually

2048
01:50:22,289 --> 01:50:26,699
managed to publish a data model we just

2049
01:50:24,809 --> 01:50:32,699
couldn't constrain the problem space

2050
01:50:26,699 --> 01:50:35,098
enough even for ECA and apply it but we

2051
01:50:32,699 --> 01:50:37,199
did actually have some success with

2052
01:50:35,099 --> 01:50:41,340
publishing a framework so there is an

2053
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:44,339
RFC that was published by the ISE so as

2054
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:47,849
you're kind of discussing or continue to

2055
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:50,010
discuss intense and the you know I've

2056
01:50:47,849 --> 01:50:51,750
looked at a couple of the documents that

2057
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:56,070
the NMR do is working on now you may

2058
01:50:51,750 --> 01:51:00,690
also want to look at that super

2059
01:50:56,070 --> 01:51:02,460
documents although it is does talk about

2060
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:04,110
sort of two information models one is a

2061
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:06,899
general-purpose information model the

2062
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:10,139
other is an ECA BAE

2063
01:51:06,899 --> 01:51:12,379
information model so going back to net

2064
01:51:10,139 --> 01:51:15,929
mod essentially what we wanted to do

2065
01:51:12,379 --> 01:51:18,360
with this document was treat it as a

2066
01:51:15,929 --> 01:51:20,030
gravity world and pull some of the

2067
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:23,129
philosophical

2068
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:25,590
Fissel of some of the general discussion

2069
01:51:23,129 --> 01:51:28,769
of eca

2070
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:31,860
out of the data model solution work so

2071
01:51:28,769 --> 01:51:34,889
in terms of what are the use cases how

2072
01:51:31,860 --> 01:51:39,058
do you define the process how do you

2073
01:51:34,889 --> 01:51:42,629
manage a condition and event and an

2074
01:51:39,059 --> 01:51:46,409
action where do you store the state what

2075
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:48,389
type of language might you apply or how

2076
01:51:46,409 --> 01:51:51,629
you would not all the tree to actually

2077
01:51:48,389 --> 01:51:56,789
implement the logic how you handle

2078
01:51:51,629 --> 01:52:01,039
notification things like policy

2079
01:51:56,789 --> 01:52:03,570
management rule management and policy

2080
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:07,800
resolution especially in the case of

2081
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:10,820
conflict or competing rules you know all

2082
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:15,329
of these are actually quite important

2083
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:16,889
aspects and not necessarily discussion

2084
01:52:15,329 --> 01:52:19,978
that you want to have in the solution

2085
01:52:16,889 --> 01:52:22,320
documents themselves so that's why we

2086
01:52:19,979 --> 01:52:24,899
kind of put together this framework

2087
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:27,239
document and you don't necessarily

2088
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:29,849
implement the framework you just use it

2089
01:52:27,239 --> 01:52:31,619
you know for your your own maybe sort of

2090
01:52:29,849 --> 01:52:33,629
vendor or operator specific

2091
01:52:31,619 --> 01:52:36,360
implementation so it doesn't necessarily

2092
01:52:33,629 --> 01:52:39,179
give you an exact guide of how to

2093
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:42,570
implement ECA obviously into your

2094
01:52:39,179 --> 01:52:45,599
network the document also talks about

2095
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:49,169
some implementation considerations

2096
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:52,530
around operations and security and I

2097
01:52:49,169 --> 01:52:54,179
noticed that earlier today security was

2098
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:57,209
kind of mentioned I think in Alex's

2099
01:52:54,179 --> 01:52:59,309
documents as an open issue but it was

2100
01:52:57,209 --> 01:53:02,039
also it seems to be an open issue as

2101
01:52:59,309 --> 01:53:04,050
well in terms of discussion in the

2102
01:53:02,039 --> 01:53:06,239
intent classification document so there

2103
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:09,419
may be some text that we could actually

2104
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:11,968
build on that's actually used in this

2105
01:53:09,419 --> 01:53:15,929
document now because we're kind of

2106
01:53:11,969 --> 01:53:17,459
constrained on time for for this

2107
01:53:15,929 --> 01:53:21,070
presentation I'm not going to go to all

2108
01:53:17,459 --> 01:53:24,340
of these slides what you could do

2109
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:25,989
offline is if you're interested in the

2110
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:27,340
framework document is kind of take a

2111
01:53:25,989 --> 01:53:29,860
look at some of the questions that we're

2112
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:35,260
asking at the moment so you know things

2113
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:40,210
like the preparation of ECA rules are

2114
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:42,219
scheduling delegation cataloging how you

2115
01:53:40,210 --> 01:53:46,330
manage state is essentialized as a

2116
01:53:42,219 --> 01:53:50,950
distributed is a combination of both yes

2117
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:53,980
probably depends on the application and

2118
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:57,309
and if each of those actually represents

2119
01:53:53,980 --> 01:54:01,030
almost another set of decision trees and

2120
01:53:57,310 --> 01:54:02,860
sort of some fairly complex systems

2121
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:05,400
management again things that you

2122
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:08,920
probably don't want to specifically

2123
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:11,620
describe in a solution document ie the

2124
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:13,450
data models themselves so this this

2125
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:17,530
document may never be published actually

2126
01:54:13,450 --> 01:54:19,570
in net Mott it may have a time horizon

2127
01:54:17,530 --> 01:54:21,910
of six months and then we just kind of

2128
01:54:19,570 --> 01:54:24,790
close it down it was just a way to kind

2129
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:27,130
of consolidate discussion rather than

2130
01:54:24,790 --> 01:54:29,110
just flooding the mailing list that may

2131
01:54:27,130 --> 01:54:33,790
mean actually that we could use some of

2132
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:36,370
the the text for ongoing work in the NMR

2133
01:54:33,790 --> 01:54:41,969
g which are kind of get to in just a

2134
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:44,650
couple of moments i think another big

2135
01:54:41,969 --> 01:54:48,610
important area that will probably

2136
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:50,500
require further study is managing

2137
01:54:48,610 --> 01:54:53,200
conflict when you're trying to apply

2138
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:56,560
policies now Ben was just kind of talked

2139
01:54:53,200 --> 01:55:01,410
about sort of service assurance and

2140
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:05,469
applying almost kind of a hierarchy of

2141
01:55:01,410 --> 01:55:07,710
ECA rules you know which which could

2142
01:55:05,469 --> 01:55:13,600
actually be if you think about recursive

2143
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:15,580
ECA that in a sense is decorative intent

2144
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:19,000
you're essentially starting at a high

2145
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:20,650
level you're noticing aggregation of a

2146
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,260
particular service or application

2147
01:55:20,650 --> 01:55:27,790
traffic and then you're gonna drop down

2148
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:31,200
through a hierarchy of ECA rules in

2149
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:33,550
order to identify a specific attribute

2150
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,900
potentially that's causing a problem

2151
01:55:33,550 --> 01:55:36,540
where

2152
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:41,280
it's packet last or just aggregation of

2153
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:43,890
signal or application traffic and there

2154
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:46,110
are going to be sort of there's gonna

2155
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:47,850
have to be some kind of control of sort

2156
01:55:46,110 --> 01:55:49,139
of what you enable and when you enable

2157
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:52,170
it and you obviously don't want to break

2158
01:55:49,140 --> 01:55:54,060
your network as well so all all of these

2159
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:59,580
things are actually sort of really

2160
01:55:54,060 --> 01:56:02,130
important I mentioned that the the

2161
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:04,760
document in net mod also has some sort

2162
01:56:02,130 --> 01:56:06,630
of implementation considerations

2163
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:08,219
discussion text so these around

2164
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:10,980
operations and security

2165
01:56:08,219 --> 01:56:12,090
so here again in terms of database

2166
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:17,549
management

2167
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:20,190
so using ECA how do you authorize it you

2168
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:22,440
know how do you manage who has access or

2169
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:25,019
how you delegate a particular ECA to a

2170
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:26,820
device who's allowed to do that when are

2171
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:29,310
they allowed to do that

2172
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:32,429
what kind of method would you use in

2173
01:56:29,310 --> 01:56:34,409
order to apply that policy we also sort

2174
01:56:32,429 --> 01:56:40,380
of highlight some database discussion as

2175
01:56:34,409 --> 01:56:45,239
well specifically the various states of

2176
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:47,610
data so what are we looking for in the

2177
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:49,468
NMR G currently well not much really

2178
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:51,150
just sort of highlighting that this

2179
01:56:49,469 --> 01:56:52,940
particular document exists and then it

2180
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:55,170
points to some of the solution work

2181
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:59,940
obviously it's it's low level it's

2182
01:56:55,170 --> 01:57:04,380
imperative policy usage but it may make

2183
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:08,360
a lot of sense actually to consider how

2184
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:11,340
this work I you know II see a maps to

2185
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:14,460
intent you know your things like intent

2186
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:16,489
classification or service insurance so

2187
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:18,810
documenting the relationship between

2188
01:57:16,489 --> 01:57:20,370
some of the net mod work and some of the

2189
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:24,690
discussion that we're having in this

2190
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:26,929
document to existing NMR G discussion

2191
01:57:24,690 --> 01:57:29,099
documents although they are individual

2192
01:57:26,929 --> 01:57:33,900
efforts at the moment you know could be

2193
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:37,310
of interest and also a piece of work

2194
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:40,170
that I'm working on currently under the

2195
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:42,389
UK project called NGC di which has

2196
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,699
converged digital infrastructure it's an

2197
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:47,850
EP SRC funded project so not

2198
01:57:44,699 --> 01:57:50,429
european-wide just focused in the UK

2199
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:53,820
we're actually looking at ECA

2200
01:57:50,430 --> 01:57:59,510
implementations we're establishing what

2201
01:57:53,820 --> 01:58:02,540
kind of devices could we apply ECA

2202
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:06,180
against and essentially a device isn't

2203
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:08,580
just a router or some kind of forwarding

2204
01:58:06,180 --> 01:58:12,420
or functional element but it's a limited

2205
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:15,269
controller in you may be in a very sort

2206
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:18,570
of specific technology domain comprising

2207
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:20,790
of a couple of notes and actually what

2208
01:58:18,570 --> 01:58:21,989
we're doing there is also trying to

2209
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:24,750
identify what are the applicable

2210
01:58:21,989 --> 01:58:27,989
languages the rules what is the current

2211
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:29,790
arch how widely deployed are they are

2212
01:58:27,989 --> 01:58:32,580
they applicable for all types of ECA

2213
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:34,410
obviously not so we are looking at

2214
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:35,730
network and resource and database

2215
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:42,180
management and just trying to classify

2216
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:44,610
them thanks Dan for very being very

2217
01:58:42,180 --> 01:58:52,440
concise questions to the presentation

2218
01:58:44,610 --> 01:58:57,630
from done quick Diego yes developers

2219
01:58:52,440 --> 01:59:00,480
again not just Mark III I think I agree

2220
01:58:57,630 --> 01:59:02,220
with I would say yes to most of the

2221
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:04,230
questions there or to all of the

2222
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:07,110
questions I think it's interesting is

2223
01:59:04,230 --> 01:59:09,599
interesting among other things because I

2224
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:14,099
agree with them that is not everything

2225
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:16,710
is suitable for ITF activity but it's

2226
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:18,810
interesting here especially because ECA

2227
01:59:16,710 --> 01:59:20,090
probably is the best way we have to

2228
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:22,470
discuss about what I would call

2229
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:26,250
low-level intent or base intent or

2230
01:59:22,470 --> 01:59:27,420
whatever we call it in the previous

2231
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:30,270
presentations we'll be talking about

2232
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:32,700
precisely through a conflict resolution

2233
01:59:30,270 --> 01:59:34,710
reasoning etc and reasoning about how

2234
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:37,080
this is translated and how different

2235
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:39,950
sources of intent and different channels

2236
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:42,900
this is something that would help and

2237
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:44,790
well would help us well to understand

2238
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:46,410
better what we are referring when we

2239
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:50,250
talk about intent this is something

2240
01:59:46,410 --> 01:59:52,290
interesting so definitely yes

2241
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:57,809
and if we can translate this into some

2242
01:59:52,290 --> 02:00:00,900
kind of easy a framework document happy

2243
01:59:57,809 --> 02:00:05,400
supported them probably probably help

2244
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:08,638
with it cool yeah great text is even

2245
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:10,769
better yeah and I think especially for

2246
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:12,449
question two this is something I

2247
02:00:10,770 --> 02:00:15,090
indicated to Dan through some exchange

2248
02:00:12,449 --> 02:00:16,919
that I think a good starting point could

2249
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:18,809
be positioning we offer the kind of

2250
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:21,119
internal proto intern framework you have

2251
02:00:18,809 --> 02:00:22,469
your ETL framer proposal I really think

2252
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:24,900
that there is a link between the two

2253
02:00:22,469 --> 02:00:27,420
where ECI is kind of end of the chain

2254
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:29,519
application of an intent could be

2255
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:31,650
interesting to see how the two maps if

2256
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,539
there are gaps how they get into work so

2257
02:00:31,650 --> 02:00:36,388
potential interesting questions to

2258
02:00:33,539 --> 02:00:39,380
discuss and again if you translate into

2259
02:00:36,389 --> 02:00:42,719
documents even better for IHF or IETF

2260
02:00:39,380 --> 02:00:45,210
thank you very much cool we at the end

2261
02:00:42,719 --> 02:00:48,539
of the session time thank you very much

2262
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:50,909
for the presenters first all the good

2263
02:00:48,539 --> 02:00:53,070
questions and comments especially for

2264
02:00:50,909 --> 02:00:55,679
the to last presentation since they were

2265
02:00:53,070 --> 02:00:58,320
also linked to draft that are being

2266
02:00:55,679 --> 02:01:02,250
proposed in the IETF I would propose

2267
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:04,440
that the offers can send an already been

2268
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:07,320
done partially but send the draft to the

2269
02:01:04,440 --> 02:01:11,070
nlg mailing list and ask for opinion

2270
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:13,159
from the group a way to maintain some

2271
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:15,659
kind of relationship between this

2272
02:01:13,159 --> 02:01:17,940
different bodies of work I think it's

2273
02:01:15,659 --> 02:01:19,170
interesting proposal and I we really

2274
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:21,928
would like that it doesn't stops after

2275
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:25,110
this meeting so maybe try to entertain

2276
02:01:21,929 --> 02:01:27,530
some some some discussions thank you

2277
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:29,549
again we have a session also tomorrow

2278
02:01:27,530 --> 02:01:32,179
last session of the meeting so please

2279
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:34,650
join us there will be discussion on

2280
02:01:32,179 --> 02:01:36,510
relation I mean use of artificial

2281
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:38,070
intelligence for network and also some

2282
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:40,619
feedback on the side meeting and

2283
02:01:38,070 --> 02:01:47,030
discussion on the Charter thank you see

2284
02:01:40,619 --> 02:01:47,030
you tomorrow see you tomorrow thank you

2285
02:01:56,989 --> 02:02:01,888
if if you are not signed the blue sheets

2286
02:01:59,639 --> 02:02:04,730
they are here on the table don't forget

2287
02:02:01,889 --> 02:02:04,730
to sign the blue sheets
