1
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:15,190
they didn't know why we were even asking

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:18,279
I had sent invitations out to

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,439
the ietf liaisons list and some of the

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,910
feedback I got was wait why this is not

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,980
the kind of information we share with

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,500
our with our points of contact and and

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,750
they didn't no one came to any of the

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,290
calls and there were other groups that I

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,519
tried to reach out to what we ended up

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,559
hearing was that it would be more

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,270
powerful to say okay you don't have to

12
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,190
sit there and make sausage with us but

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:43,620
could you at least join us at breakfast

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:46,629
and see how that goes

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,019
okay the third and final of these

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:53,129
meetings had six people so we had this

17
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:56,350
great step function as we went through

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:59,050
and this group also said that IAD

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:02,440
involvement is critical for all sorts of

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,710
reasons this is where there was a

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,179
suggestion to bring in past IAB and ITF

22
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:12,009
chairs as core membership because they

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,260
presumably would have a longer term

24
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,880
vision now part of what made that funny

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,440
is the person who suggested it at the

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,550
time also said that would be me but I

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:25,450
don't want to do that so but the idea

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:28,300
was out there they really wanted the

29
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:30,310
group to look to the the long term

30
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,259
structure of the RFC editor this is not

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,090
about short-term tactical things this is

32
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,240
a we need to come up with a model that

33
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,800
will actually survive for more than two

34
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,600
or three years we're looking at more

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,009
like eight ten twelve we'll see some of

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,570
the long term structural issues that

37
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,000
they felt this group really need to

38
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,179
clearly focus on this group being you

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,530
know whatever program or working group

40
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,000
is put together would be things like

41
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,240
business issues where where funding

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,870
should come from administration who and

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,600
how hiring and firing should be handled

44
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:10,479
and editorial control how does that work

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,950
who gets to say no to publishing

46
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:19,269
something and under what circumstances

47
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:21,640
it was fairly clear that one one of the

48
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:25,240
things that the IETF community is really

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,059
good at is developing heroes people you

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,720
know you you you you get these

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,610
individuals and

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,109
the rolls are built around the

53
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,520
individual and what the individual can

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,440
do because the individual is really good

55
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,810
at that but then if that individual

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,740
changes people want the role to change

57
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,480
because they're not sure they're going

58
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,500
to trust the next person as much as they

59
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,149
trusted the original entity um that

60
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,620
makes it really hard to actually define

61
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,310
a role and if you put something out for

62
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,320
contract you can't say well here's what

63
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,410
the contract is and we'll add more later

64
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:01,299
if we decide we trust you trust me that

65
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:04,000
does not work well so there were there

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,100
are meetings here's you know basically

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,260
the summary we've got consistent you

68
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,470
know open and open participation as a

69
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,989
fundamental necessity something that

70
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:17,220
looks like a working group including the

71
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,990
the potential for an initial design team

72
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,520
did I mention the open participation and

73
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,080
making sure this is as transparent as

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,340
possible that that was a pretty common

75
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:31,660
theme throughout and focus more in the

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:34,209
long term in the short term so the

77
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,650
proposal and this was put together in an

78
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,560
internet draft how many of you have read

79
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:43,140
the internet drafts I love you guys

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,239
you're awesome thank you was that this

81
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,268
proposal is that this in fact become an

82
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,500
IV program with open membership strong

83
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:55,120
support for remote participation and a

84
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,010
group that would produce regular meeting

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,920
minutes and community updates in

86
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,769
whatever forum makes the most sense the

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,619
scope of work would include you know

88
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,390
just determining what is the full scope

89
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,880
of responsibilities within the RFC

90
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,298
editor in particular that those for the

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,070
RFC series editor to consider and

92
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:18,608
propose business and administration

93
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:24,250
requirements funding management that

94
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:26,219
kind of thing and also to actively

95
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,840
solicit input from organizations that

96
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,370
are going to be impacted by changes in

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,979
the series whether or not they want to

98
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,300
actually have anything to do with with

99
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,440
guiding that one way or the other

100
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,180
they're still going to have to consume

101
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,469
what comes out of it and therefore they

102
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,470
do have a certain stake in the game

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,109
there's been some discussion on the RFC

104
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:49,050
interest list about the draft and also

105
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,629
on on my advisory group which is a very

106
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:57,090
unofficial group of folks that that I

107
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:59,819
use as a brain trust periodically but I

108
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,138
suspect there are things that could be

109
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,729
improved in that draft there are things

110
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,940
that could be improved in the proposal

111
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:08,699
of how to run this and that's what I was

112
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,830
hoping we would discuss today we already

113
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,389
have a jabber scribe Thank You Adrian

114
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,630
and we have a note-taker

115
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:18,630
Thank You Sara when you come to the mic

116
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,759
if you would say your name slowly and

117
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,419
clearly I would appreciate it as wit

118
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,849
Sara and for the folks who are on me

119
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:29,210
deco I apologize for not being a working

120
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:31,889
group chair I will do my best

121
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,479
this is Adrian on that meet echo point

122
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,580
since you weren't in the jabber room

123
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,340
while you were talking me Tech has only

124
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,740
just come up so the remote people have

125
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,609
missed apart from your slides they'd

126
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,080
miss hearing your wonderful voice but

127
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,080
hopefully I'm not doing all that again

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,250
hmm wait a minute I need I need to see

129
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,250
who's on me deck Oh

130
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,200
if the me deco folks do have like

131
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,490
specific questions about stuff let me

132
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:14,590
know I guess the one thing I would

133
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:16,360
really focus Terry much on talking about

134
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,650
the process of making decisions we're

135
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,840
not talking about the decisions

136
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,729
themselves and the different

137
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,229
possibilities for how they the RC edit

138
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:28,390
or model could go that's that's out of

139
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:31,890
scope for today okay and with that I

140
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,890
will open for discussion

141
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:48,940
hi I just one comment so I mean we have

142
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,940
an RFC that describes the RFC editor

143
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:56,650
model so is the output what you're

144
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:58,030
proposing revision of that I would

145
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,489
expect that would be part of the scope

146
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,830
yes so if if the group decides it

147
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,680
necessary I mean I it would be also

148
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:10,390
perfectly reasonable to say the RFC

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,280
editor model to still should make sense

150
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:13,690
it just wasn't implemented well if

151
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,909
that's if that's what the group decides

152
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,580
that's also perfectly reasonable well I

153
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:22,720
mean so I mean I was involved in the

154
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:26,349
BIST that is now in the RFC editor for

155
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,419
the LLC changes and I think there were

156
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,950
some issues there's some things of the

157
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,680
documents that kill you don't match the

158
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:36,849
current reality so I don't know if this

159
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,370
is the right so I think this would be a

160
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:45,669
good place to yeah that work yes there

161
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:47,200
we go okay Ted Hardy speaking I just

162
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,830
wanted to reaffirm based on the

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,840
discussions the IB had earlier the

164
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,099
summer that were clearly happy to do

165
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,409
whatever the community wants here

166
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,979
including spin up a program according to

167
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:02,220
the lights that the draft suggests think

168
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,219
you did

169
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:16,130
oh hello Brian crock and sir

170
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:19,280
I keep annoying Ted with this but I

171
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:22,880
think I'd want to say it here because

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,830
it's my fault that the IB Charter

173
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,450
doesn't actually describe what the IB

174
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,469
does in respect of the RFC editor

175
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,830
because it has some very specific

176
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,419
wording in which possibly was originally

177
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,550
written by Christiaan actually in the

178
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,159
previous version of the Charter saying

179
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,109
that what the IB does is approve the

180
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,610
appointment of an organisation to act as

181
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:49,190
RFC editor and and its general policy or

182
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:53,480
words to that effect I think reality is

183
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:56,180
for the last 10 years at least the IB

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,400
has done more than that and I think one

185
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,280
outcome of this process should be that

186
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:04,520
the IV takes it upon itself to propose

187
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,050
an update to its own Charter to make

188
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,210
sure the Charter actually describes

189
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,790
reality you're all we just reality to

190
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,680
match the Charter in that you know the

191
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:17,620
discrepancy shouldn't shouldn't survive

192
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,939
I'd also make a request to the IB that

193
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,100
it will be very helpful as this process

194
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,400
goes forward if the IAB itself

195
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,400
affirms the independent editorial status

196
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,020
of the RFC editor because to me that was

197
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:37,760
always obvious we didn't write it down

198
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:39,710
and we should have done no it's okay

199
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,500
uncle I just wanted to know if I needed

200
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:46,970
to go to the other line right i-601

201
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,310
happening another um please yeah okay

202
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,250
this is a general in preparation for

203
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,760
this meeting I not only read reread the

204
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,730
RFC editor and I asked at 2.0 and I read

205
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,600
your document so this is a reflection on

206
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,640
both since you're proposing a since bob

207
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,050
was talking very generally about a

208
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,930
revision of that document there it seems

209
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:15,140
to be someplace in all of this for a

210
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:18,500
respect of trust that seems to be

211
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:22,790
missing in the documents in in

212
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,680
in modern oh you're getting coffee

213
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:29,589
that's a very important thing to listen

214
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:32,390
with tell me when you're ready okay good

215
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,850
there have been numerous books read

216
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:38,090
about written about the speed of trust

217
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:41,480
and and a respect for professionalism

218
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:46,340
and the startup model and I find this

219
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,920
lacking so when you talk about there's

220
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,770
just feedback when you talk about

221
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:55,939
orchestrating such and such it appears

222
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:59,240
like you're treating the RFC editor like

223
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,700
a bureaucracy point when by the

224
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,670
structure presented in both documents

225
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,620
the person there's a highly skilled

226
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:11,270
professional and should be treated as

227
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,550
such so it all of this discussion I know

228
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,730
it's about process but the thing I find

229
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,859
missing in the process is the place for

230
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,720
the respect of the professionalism that

231
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,090
we have and all of us are here are

232
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,880
professionals most of us have advanced

233
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,800
degrees a person who comes with library

234
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,390
science is an equal professional with

235
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,490
equals standards I I the feedback is I

236
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:40,610
don't see that in this and I find that a

237
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:44,090
missing piece because in a contract it

238
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,700
it's under at-will employment at-will

239
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,830
employment says we're both working

240
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,890
together for a professional goal if we

241
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,380
both think it's not working

242
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:57,800
we discontinue because it's not working

243
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,950
and no harm no foul we're gonna go home

244
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,170
and play in our corners by ourselves

245
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,120
that's that's not here at all in this in

246
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,780
these documents or in this dream or in

247
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,970
this discussion and I find that

248
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:15,800
problematic since that is the essence of

249
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,200
what makes startups go fast and I think

250
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:23,990
we want to go fast with our publications

251
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,960
and with our with our work Thank You Ted

252
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:32,240
Hardy I wanted to go back to the process

253
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,920
issue that Brian raised and I'm sorry

254
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,749
go ahead I was supposed to give my

255
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,459
name's sue Harris Brian was requesting

256
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:44,029
that an output of this process be that

257
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:45,559
the IB adjust its Charter to match the

258
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,619
reality that resulted from the end of

259
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,379
the process and well I think that's a

260
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:56,720
valid outcome it can't be through an IEP

261
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:57,829
program because the BCP because the IB

262
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,119
Charter is a PCP

263
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:04,279
it's an ITF output and it needs an IETF

264
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:07,189
process to approve it however one

265
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,139
possibility here might be that the the

266
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:11,059
results of the IB program could be a

267
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:14,329
proposal that could go to the recently

268
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:17,929
minted gen dispatch process for figuring

269
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:19,969
out how it became an actual DCP but just

270
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:23,779
I think it's quite important to note

271
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:26,509
that the the IAB doesn't update its own

272
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:31,999
Charter it doesn't have that right or

273
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:35,119
power Thank You Leslie Leslie Nagel and

274
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:37,189
I'm gonna I'm not sure that I agree with

275
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:39,799
what Ted just said but I'd have to go

276
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:41,660
digging um I stood up here because I

277
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,999
wanted to talk a little bit about in

278
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,189
that and talking about the process the

279
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:49,189
how I think we also need to make sure

280
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:51,679
we're clear on the what what you were

281
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:52,879
articulating a moment ago included you

282
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,559
know talking about how do we fund the

283
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,079
RFC editor how do we do this how do we

284
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,759
do that and I'm very concerned that we

285
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:02,420
start a process that looks like saying

286
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:04,519
hey let's define an a document

287
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,069
publication system let's do it all from

288
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:10,639
you know table Raza which I don't think

289
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:12,740
is the ask so maybe part of the how is

290
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,509
to first articulate what are the top

291
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,019
order problems that we think we have to

292
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,959
solve and stay focused on those Thank

293
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:25,600
You Becker

294
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:30,258
yeah it's Erica scroller I mean this

295
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,910
overall plan seems generally sound I I

296
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:34,069
think I wouldn't there have been the

297
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,899
document about how did we should I

298
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:37,459
shares my view could candidates first in

299
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,470
this I think probably that's not a good

300
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:43,549
plan okay excellent

301
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,779
I guess I I'm restraining myself oh no

302
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,069
but I guess I've asked others written

303
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:47,329
those would probably don't have to have

304
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,399
discussion about the substantive

305
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:52,008
outcomes right here I'm sure we also at

306
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,600
them but I think right I think less

307
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,889
whose point about what's the scope is

308
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,050
relevant I think certainly we should be

309
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:58,579
he's read that money from this comes

310
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,550
from the LLC and light that's sort of

311
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:04,819
that sort of stuff but I think you know

312
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,889
the the a from from from my perspective

313
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,750
you know that we should be assuming that

314
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:10,160
but that the overall question is at what

315
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,170
best serves the needs of the community

316
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,660
I'm going forward into the next as you

317
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,880
say ten or whatever years thank you I

318
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,750
think Mike st. John's I've got three

319
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,699
things let me hit eckers first one of

320
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:25,970
the problems were having is who gets to

321
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:32,359
call consensus the reason for suggesting

322
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:34,790
the chairs was a passed a level of

323
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:39,110
expertise with respect to the IETF and

324
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:42,860
the community and some measure of crust

325
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,360
if you will so that was the set of P set

326
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,399
of people that might have made made

327
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,750
sense for that so I don't know if that's

328
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,880
where we're gonna go but at some point

329
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,649
in time somebody's gonna have to decide

330
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,670
what the consensus is and we got to

331
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:57,740
figure out to do that in a way that's

332
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:02,990
neutral between the sides that are that

333
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:05,480
are currently lining up here with

334
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,579
respect to with respect to the output of

335
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,089
this thing I think we're looking for

336
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:13,579
eventually a BCP as the output of this

337
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:16,880
of this process which means it will be a

338
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:18,709
community consensus not an IAB consensus

339
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,579
on the IAB program that we're standing

340
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:24,739
up okay people may disagree with that

341
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,300
but I think if that's where we're going

342
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,120
that's what we should be looking at and

343
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,180
the third thing I think is the IAB ought

344
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,279
to think about what it wants its role to

345
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,138
be in this thing and actually come

346
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,920
forward with a consensus document from

347
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,380
themselves

348
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,589
about what their what they think the

349
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,279
role should be going forward so okay

350
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,750
thank you

351
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,819
Suzanne Suzanne Wolfe I think I'm just

352
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,269
like lead to my surprise I'm about to

353
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:54,709
reinforce what Mike just said the critic

354
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:57,800
the critical point here might well be

355
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,930
who calls consensus or what do we do to

356
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,370
guarantee the process terminates

357
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,579
if consensus turns out to be as

358
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:08,990
difficult as it looks like it might be

359
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:11,360
because we did all of this not so very

360
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,430
long ago I mean I feel old saying that

361
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:17,060
but it doesn't seem like it was that

362
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:20,630
long ago and we did have as I recall a

363
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:23,030
fairly hard-fought plan to basically

364
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,560
reuse existing process in a way that

365
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,119
meant that we were in a situation then

366
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,619
where the process the process of

367
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,570
figuring out this model had to terminate

368
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,570
decisions had to be made in order for

369
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,340
the function to continue to be performed

370
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,689
where in roughly that situation now

371
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,129
which means we do need a forcing

372
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,140
function because we can't you know we

373
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,000
can't let this drag on indefinitely and

374
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,530
sort of putting on those kind of

375
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,240
constraints and figuring out how to

376
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:48,680
reuse existing legitimate process to

377
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,690
make sure that this process terminates

378
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:56,270
seems like a really important first

379
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:58,670
order priority Thank You Leslie Leslie

380
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:01,610
they go again just following up my side

381
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:05,180
remark about Ted's comment on updating

382
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,770
RC 2850 and and not to grind down on a

383
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,500
detail but because I think it's an

384
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:13,700
important point about what the IAB

385
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:17,810
should feel it can and cannot do so RFC

386
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,630
2850 as a BCP is indeed subject to is G

387
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,270
approval it is as my exceed John's

388
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:28,460
articulated a question of getting

389
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:31,070
community consensus on any changes but

390
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:34,160
speaking as somebody who used to sit in

391
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,620
the ivy chair role and went through many

392
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,350
years of you know feeling me what can we

393
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,989
do but what can't we do if it comes to

394
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,719
updating the IAB charter first order

395
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,030
priority is to do the right thing and

396
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,530
make it read the right way and if the IB

397
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,750
has to you know have a glaring match

398
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,270
with the is G over you know approve this

399
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,610
or not

400
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:59,720
that's the job anyway my point being

401
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,899
really that it's in some of what Ted

402
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,190
said and I'll be glad to have him

403
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,050
clarify so that I don't walk away out of

404
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,730
the room feeling this way it sounded a

405
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,460
little bit like well we'd like to do

406
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,470
that but we're not sure we can or you

407
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,380
know whatever the IB is not subject to

408
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,140
the IAS G

409
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,780
okay since I think this is a direct

410
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,169
response why don't you go ahead Ted

411
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,120
Hardy speaking so I think that the point

412
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,299
I was making is a process point we're

413
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:32,610
here to discuss the process and Brian's

414
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:35,610
point was that he wanted to see a change

415
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:38,209
to the IB Charter to reflect the reality

416
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:42,178
that comes out of this community process

417
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:45,780
and I'm happy to agree with him that

418
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:48,000
that's a value a valuable output but I

419
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:50,639
think I wanted to make the point that

420
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,850
once it has come out of this process

421
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,990
that output then has to go through the

422
00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:00,389
ITF process because it's updating a BCP

423
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,580
now if you want to put that as a ESG

424
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:04,140
approval of it sure I think it's more

425
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,210
important that the community is a whole

426
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,130
approves of it and so it has to go

427
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,650
through the ITF last call process and

428
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,240
the other processes Jen dispatch has

429
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,980
been created for mechanisms like that

430
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,049
where some other thing has been created

431
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,970
externally that's more or less ready for

432
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:21,030
ITF discussion and that's the point I

433
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:24,360
was making I continue to think however

434
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:27,059
that if the if the folks in this room

435
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,250
agree with Mike st. John that the output

436
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,740
of this is of ECP and that therefore

437
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:35,130
it's something that reflects that sort

438
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,220
of consensus then running an ITF working

439
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,140
group like process in the IAB and then

440
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,169
bringing it over to the ITF to create a

441
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,240
BCP is an extra step you could simply

442
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:46,340
run the ITF working group like process

443
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,510
in the IETF

444
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,730
because you're still gonna have to have

445
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,970
the isg come to consensus on the output

446
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:57,120
in order for it to become a BCP so I

447
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:00,480
think there's a there's a real question

448
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,780
there of whether you want the the

449
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,740
process that runs to be just IETF like

450
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,309
or an IETF

451
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,450
process if if what you're doing is

452
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,450
updating the current documents the way

453
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:15,380
Bob Hinton put them then an IEP process

454
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,400
that runs with open participation and

455
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,659
selected chair from the community is

456
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,970
perfectly fine at doing that because

457
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:22,679
those are IEP documents and the IEP can

458
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,760
update those without then going to get

459
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,920
the is G's approval

460
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,410
but if what you eventually want is the

461
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,390
aSG's approval then the simplest way to

462
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,990
do that is to run the process the IHG

463
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,760
manages okay well we'll have one more on

464
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,390
this topic but then I want to get to the

465
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,510
rest of the line

466
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,950
um I think Ted misunderstood me or was

467
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,860
conflating a couple of different things

468
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,260
I'm I'm suggesting that the output of

469
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,659
this thing is a BCP which means it's

470
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:53,290
community consensus I'm suggesting that

471
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:56,500
the IAD separately look at its role and

472
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,360
provide input into the BCP and then as

473
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:05,440
its own action figure out what it needs

474
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:09,370
to do about its Charter okay aeryn aeryn

475
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,260
Faulk full disclosure I served as part

476
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,090
of the IRC editor at one time currently

477
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,910
a member of the RFC series advisory

478
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,139
group two comments and I have to say my

479
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:23,680
thoughts are still kind of forming on

480
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:27,460
this but one when we talk about sort of

481
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:31,930
creating this activity and it is without

482
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:34,540
sort of talking in a detail about the

483
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,510
what it's a blank box I feel like it

484
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,980
would be important as an early output

485
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:43,000
would be sort of a statement of

486
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,500
principles right I think that one of the

487
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,300
things I think that's defined the RFC

488
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,360
series advisory group has been a sense

489
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,490
of stewardship there's a lot of history

490
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,189
here there's a real attempt to have

491
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:58,660
continuity in how our documents are

492
00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:00,340
handled and I think that that's the kind

493
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,520
of thing that there should be some sort

494
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,770
of guideposts for whatever the the

495
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,930
output of this activity comes that it's

496
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,750
is you know the things that the group

497
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:13,290
believes it supports as principles that

498
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:16,000
would make me feel a lot better as a

499
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:17,980
participant or just an observer of of

500
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,690
that activity and the other thing is

501
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,180
kind of an it but it really got to me

502
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,160
that in one of the calls the third call

503
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,390
I think the summary said the group

504
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,090
should come up with the process for the

505
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,730
long term six to eight years for a

506
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,480
50-year document series and then

507
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,150
somebody else maybe it was Ted said our

508
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,670
baby was eckers ten years I think that

509
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,530
we should believe

510
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:42,690
whatever we come up with can survive at

511
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:46,710
least 10 years preferably longer but I

512
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:51,170
think six to eight years is if too short

513
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:58,410
I'll just leave it at that Harold

514
00:23:51,170 --> 00:24:01,740
Harilal lustrum I'm thinking of Einstein

515
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:07,140
Colt or attribute Einstein which is

516
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:09,030
saying that you cannot solve problems by

517
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:17,160
the same means that you used to create

518
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:22,230
them thank you so in this particular

519
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:26,100
context I am worried that we are we have

520
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:28,590
a discussion of substance of getting to

521
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,669
the right decision and we have a

522
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:34,860
decision of formalities which is getting

523
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,410
the result of that decision through the

524
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:42,919
process to be published and we're mixing

525
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:50,820
them the basis for this whole shenanigan

526
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:55,320
was that our recent escapades starting

527
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:58,649
with our fc+ person some well before and

528
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,189
after that have shown that there's a

529
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:06,540
disconnect between leadership and

530
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:11,490
community in what we should do therefore

531
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:14,940
it's a process that needs to come up

532
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:18,810
with the right solutions needs to be

533
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:23,430
outside of the current established

534
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:27,080
procedures an IETF working group which

535
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:33,300
shares approved by the eius eius tree is

536
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:39,000
not appropriate however when that

537
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:45,210
process whatever it is concludes we will

538
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,850
run the standard process of the IETF to

539
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,930
have the resulting documents stamped

540
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:56,000
with whatever stamps they need to have

541
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:58,400
um if at that point someone wishes to

542
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,809
refight the battles I am sure that the

543
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,020
recent discussion about recall

544
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:05,090
possessions will become significant

545
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:09,889
again I hope will not get there because

546
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:14,720
I believe sincerely that this community

547
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:18,470
has a strong will to get to do the right

548
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:24,730
thing no matter what our differences of

549
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:29,300
opinion have been in the past Brian I

550
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:31,010
paranal outgoing IAB first thank you

551
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,940
very much for running this process in

552
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:36,320
this document I think the the principles

553
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:42,020
of the process that are laid out here

554
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,370
are perfectly reasonable insane and like

555
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,920
everything here is just a tweak to that

556
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:48,860
I want to reiterate what Erin said I

557
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,230
think it is very good guidance to say we

558
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:54,139
should split the principles from the

559
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:58,760
process discussion first year and then

560
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:02,120
in this program because I've seen

561
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:05,090
through this entire thing we get we get

562
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,669
really tied up on the details of the

563
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,928
process and we can lose track of what it

564
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,160
is we're actually trying to do so I

565
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,920
think we should come to agreement on

566
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,750
what it is we're trying to do and then

567
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,760
let's argue the point to process having

568
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:24,020
said that I'm gonna nitpick the process

569
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:25,400
here a little bit one so this I'm a

570
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:31,850
manager now actually so I will take that

571
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:33,860
as a compliment this this document is

572
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,870
essentially a recommendation to the IAB

573
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,719
that it should create a program I've

574
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:42,830
noticed through this entire discussion

575
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,330
that there is less trust of goodwill on

576
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,409
all sides that I have seen in many other

577
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:50,389
discussions in the IETF space so a mere

578
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,010
recommendation to the IAB that it create

579
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:53,990
a program which the IAB can create and

580
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,570
destroy programs that will may or may

581
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,390
not be enough for the community I would

582
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,530
caution in saying in taking a document

583
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,360
like this and making it more than

584
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,830
informational like so that the framework

585
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,490
around the earth Sauk essentially says

586
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,260
the IAB you

587
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:10,520
this program the IB can't close the our

588
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:12,590
sock that if we have a process document

589
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,270
that then you know creates the program

590
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,699
separate from the IEP as well to create

591
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,740
and destroy the program it will um which

592
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,510
I think is possibly a good idea just to

593
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:23,030
make sure that you know that can't

594
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,580
happen that it be time limited in

595
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:27,200
summary in some way because otherwise we

596
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:31,659
will for this particular run of the

597
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,660
process create a little bit more

598
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,720
bureaucratic technical debt and I think

599
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,429
that would be a bad outcome so just one

600
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,540
caution I think that's I mean seems

601
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,280
pretty reasonable but otherwise thank

602
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,629
you very much for this and I look

603
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:52,970
forward to participating the program

604
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:56,780
discussion Thank You Leslie um Leslie

605
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:58,910
Daigle and I think Harold articulated it

606
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,010
well in terms of making sure that we

607
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:04,370
make it separation between how we

608
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:06,620
achieve an articulation of what good

609
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,139
looks like and improve our future from

610
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:13,159
what is the process by which we will

611
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,780
produce the output so I think that's

612
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:18,470
important to keep in mind because my

613
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:21,500
earlier comment about scope top order

614
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:23,390
priority I think is that to address the

615
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,280
fact that the problems that we have the

616
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,170
ONC's that we have felt about our FC

617
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,070
series over the course of the last 18

618
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:33,170
months has often circulated around the

619
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:36,649
concern of whether or not the RFC series

620
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:39,910
is an IETF document publication stream

621
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:43,840
only which it historically has not been

622
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:47,090
arguably should not be going forward so

623
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,240
unless it has already been decided that

624
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:53,780
the IETF that the RFC series is an IETF

625
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,320
publication series period the location

626
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,940
for the discussions of what is necessary

627
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,100
for the outcome should not be uniquely

628
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,920
within the IETF which is why a working

629
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,540
group is not an IETF working group is

630
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,790
not the appropriate location for this

631
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,010
discussion even if the ultimate

632
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:15,700
documents have to go through the IETF

633
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:15,700
process for approval Ted

634
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:26,490
that hurt I believe that the key

635
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:28,409
question here that people have been

636
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:32,389
going back and forth on is who

637
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:35,360
eventually has to approve the document

638
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:40,168
that will describe the new state of play

639
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:43,408
I think the result of that may actually

640
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:45,539
be something we want to delay deciding

641
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:51,059
until we see what the new state of play

642
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:53,730
looks like my view of the document

643
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:55,740
Heather is written is that it suggests a

644
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,379
process for coming out with an output

645
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,909
and if we want to say okay we're we're

646
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:02,928
all happy enough with the open process

647
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:05,639
under the aegis of the IAB with the

648
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:09,659
trusted chairs managing the consensus

649
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:11,508
then we can decide later what process we

650
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,860
need for the publication of its outputs

651
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:19,549
because the publication of its outputs

652
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:22,289
might in fact turn out to be from a a

653
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:24,509
different view of the world than the one

654
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:27,149
we have now

655
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:30,179
I think that if we're willing to

656
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:34,889
consider that then we don't need to

657
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:37,110
decide now whether a BCP or an IB stream

658
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:39,600
document or some other stream document

659
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,209
is the eventual output of the group and

660
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,759
that since I would like us to make

661
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,490
progress today I'm gonna suggest we

662
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:51,269
consider the question of the stream of

663
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:53,879
the output separately if folks are

664
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,259
willing to do that I think we may end up

665
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:57,389
in a situation in the future where we

666
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:59,610
get multiple streams to agree we've

667
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:01,830
certainly had documents in the past like

668
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:04,619
the an a transition documents where more

669
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,059
than one body indicated its assent to a

670
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:08,459
document as it went through the process

671
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:11,549
and that we may be able to move forward

672
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,970
that way but I think I would very much

673
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:16,918
like to get some agreement today on the

674
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,830
process that we want to use moving

675
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,019
forward while we still have this group

676
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:28,050
gathered together and Heather's advice

677
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:30,310
on it and I don't want to to concern

678
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:32,350
extremely much although I think there's

679
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,899
been some valuable discussion with what

680
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:38,620
the output documents stream is because I

681
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:41,860
think the output of the of the group may

682
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:49,840
have an impact thank you um Wes the

683
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:52,090
Necker West heard Acharya say I like

684
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,939
what Ted just sent but to rephrase it in

685
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:58,179
a different way it was just how I was

686
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:00,670
planning on phrasing it is it feels like

687
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,860
we are trying to come up with the

688
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:04,750
results and how things are going to flow

689
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,209
without even gotten through the design

690
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:10,900
phase of knowing what it's me and it's

691
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,640
very hard to go I need to figure out how

692
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,730
to get to point B my final conclusion

693
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,920
and this this architecture without

694
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,440
knowing you know what we actually want

695
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,390
as a result so in terms of trying to

696
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,190
walk through you know what process steps

697
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,490
do we need it feels way too early and

698
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:29,650
what we need right now is a is a to

699
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,960
formulate how we can have that initial

700
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,560
design discussion and you know where

701
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,570
that should be

702
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,419
and I think the you know the proposal of

703
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,700
an IV open IAB works work area or an

704
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,930
IETF working group I don't really care

705
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,240
because I think the process steps are

706
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,310
actually gonna occur after that and once

707
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,080
we know okay we want these outputs and

708
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,389
that may be changing charters to all

709
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,889
sorts of stuff and as an IAB member not

710
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,410
speaking for the rest of the IV I am

711
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:56,050
more than happy to change the IAB

712
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,610
charter to reflect the needs of the

713
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,980
community because that's what I want

714
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:02,590
right I want the entire community to be

715
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,180
happy with these results and that brings

716
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:07,240
me to my final point which is that

717
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:10,090
calling consensus is not nearly as

718
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,310
important as getting the community to

719
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,830
agree that that was the right call

720
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:16,719
right if one group has to call for

721
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,759
consensus and then there's gonna be a

722
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,230
fight over it that's a huge issue

723
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,970
because that means that there is it

724
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,490
there is a disagreement and it's much

725
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,469
more important to get into a forum where

726
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:28,658
consensus is gonna happen anyway and

727
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:31,359
that the the end result of the

728
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,030
groupthink will be yeah you know maybe

729
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,500
not everybody agrees but but everybody

730
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,760
does agree that that you know the

731
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:41,050
majority of the opinion went that

732
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:43,600
direction thank you Hecker yeah April

733
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,250
yeah I think there in a couple sort of

734
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,719
process and trying to keep my my

735
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,280
thoughts about the process issues were

736
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,959
raised here I think one is what is the

737
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,340
forum forum for discussion and trying to

738
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,679
bring about some sort consensus and the

739
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,480
second is you know what is the minimum

740
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,920
threshold of people who must have a cent

741
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,890
to these other changes once they've come

742
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,660
about working backwards from that I I

743
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,279
agree with Ted that like we'd have to

744
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,420
like knowing what the changes are would

745
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,980
kind of tell you who had to have a cent

746
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,810
and you might find later that you know

747
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,520
as a concrete example you know say that

748
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,810
the proposal is that we know we spent

749
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,550
over a million dollars a year to like

750
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,810
you know spin up a new publication how

751
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,910
it's the stamps things I'm like the

752
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,230
whole tablets then presumably that we

753
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,460
want the old see the sign off on that

754
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,050
even though otherwise wouldn't see

755
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,060
wouldn't have seen like a process like a

756
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:26,530
change um I think you know it's pretty

757
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,600
clear like the idea she's gonna have to

758
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,070
sign up on this like actually is all the

759
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,210
representative the ietf and like what do

760
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,680
you think there's a night if only thing

761
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,180
or like an ITF important thing it's

762
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,190
clearly I gives an enormous consumer of

763
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,480
the service as the idea that like we may

764
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,650
change that in the I issue we hate it

765
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,600
just off not something a function what

766
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,670
kind of output may be people differently

767
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,560
about that actually screws didn't say

768
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:49,690
that the in terms of process um you know

769
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,610
I don't say like a huge amount of

770
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,080
difference between like functionally

771
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,000
between like an IETF working group and

772
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,790
um and what suggested here I think

773
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,470
wasn't perfectly fine um you know um I

774
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,970
guess what I would say I think in

775
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,379
particular the primary difference seems

776
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,930
to me to be like a points to chairs

777
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,850
um I certainly would like Mike want this

778
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,049
to be run at least somewhat like an ITF

779
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,290
working group and it seems like we might

780
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,180
as well

781
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,259
voiced the mechanisms we already have

782
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,940
for trying to have like consensus

783
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,920
legitimacy out of the ITF process don't

784
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,360
we can I've been on a number of IV

785
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,760
programs they tend to be a tiny bit

786
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,810
chaotic um and if we're looking for a

787
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,770
broad community consensus we already

788
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,330
have a core set of processes are

789
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,660
designed to do that that the IEP program

790
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:27,400
is really designed to um but IIIi don't

791
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,839
know not to say like it has to be like

792
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,950
MIT or working group in the sense it's

793
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,840
like on the data tracker in this bitter

794
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,250
place or you know or that it has to have

795
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,260
like a it be in the general area and

796
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,730
with that but like let's not spend like

797
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,990
a year like reinventing all our

798
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,730
processes for like for like having

799
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,580
discussions and committee consensus um

800
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:46,320
also we have to thank you

801
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,970
pitch yeah rich sauce Akamai I guess um

802
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,650
I'm also like I share the concern of the

803
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:53,100
previous five people who spoke about

804
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,060
let's not get wrapped up in process um

805
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,509
because I think we have a

806
00:36:55,060 --> 00:37:00,040
time line that we need to consider

807
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:04,630
working groups are not good at meeting

808
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,070
timelines and I think also there's an

809
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,520
acknowledgement that it this is bigger

810
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:11,590
than just the IETF therefore bigger than

811
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,259
just the iesg I found it really

812
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:16,150
interesting that the readouts from three

813
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:21,550
sessions you held over the course of

814
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:23,770
time the opinion of the quality or the

815
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:27,640
word the value of the IAB went up

816
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:31,740
significantly right no no never - yeah

817
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,270
maybe - yeah we should so I

818
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,649
yeah let's first get some documents

819
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,620
written I don't care maybe get just a

820
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:40,780
mailing list on the you know on data

821
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,290
tracker that's fine and then we'll then

822
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:49,360
you shop appropriately thank you

823
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:51,630
: hi : Perkins I just like to echo some

824
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:55,270
of those previous comments the the RFC

825
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:59,170
serious publishes documents for much

826
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:02,890
more than just the IETF so while the

827
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,510
IETF is send me an important body I

828
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,520
don't think this should be an IETF

829
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:10,360
working group because it's a broader

830
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:15,270
discussion although a working group like

831
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:19,030
process seems very reasonable Aaron

832
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:22,090
Aaron Falk again so I have a question I

833
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,440
guess for you and for the room so we're

834
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:27,010
creating this new thing but there's a

835
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:32,100
bunch of existing things we have the RFC

836
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:37,840
series Oversight Committee we are we are

837
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:42,279
acquiring a temporary caretaker manager

838
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:43,900
something and I'm wondering if as part

839
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:49,450
of your proposal you have any thoughts

840
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:51,970
on how those roles or individuals would

841
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:54,549
engage in this effort automatically

842
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,790
included excluded you know what do you

843
00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:00,040
think what do others think I actually

844
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,950
mentioned that in the draft that I felt

845
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,320
the RC series Oversight Committee should

846
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:08,950
focus much more on the immediate

847
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:11,920
operational issues while this is running

848
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:14,799
and and not while our sock members

849
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,800
should absolutely be you know a part of

850
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,770
whatever program comes together that

851
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:25,000
it's not their purview to run it or

852
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:29,320
bless it or share it or anything like

853
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,880
that or participate in no I they they

854
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,350
can participate but I would see it as

855
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,550
participating as individuals who happen

856
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:37,330
to have experience because they're on

857
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:41,290
the are sock and in the other role that

858
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:43,450
the temporary thing if that person again

859
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,800
wants to participate as an informed

860
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:51,129
individual I don't think there's a

861
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,650
problem with that just ask Aaron do you

862
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,940
have a concern with the are sock

863
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,890
participating as in do I totally agree

864
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,220
this is not a statement for the are sock

865
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:05,410
uh previous disc on don't know take or

866
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:07,330
Sarah charity are sock I know Aaron did

867
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:10,000
a good job so I'm not speaking for the

868
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,710
are sock other than for myself and I

869
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,900
totally agree with what Heather's

870
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,280
proposing but because you asked the

871
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,700
question it makes me wonder are you

872
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,300
concerned if the are sock as individuals

873
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:25,689
participates in this process I guess if

874
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:30,490
I would be uncomfortable if folks who

875
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:34,990
are in a in an administrative or

876
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:36,669
oversight role in how things have been

877
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,430
operating were in a leadership position

878
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,330
for this sort of reforming activities so

879
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,529
I don't have any problem with

880
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,270
participating I think that it should be

881
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,920
open the more informed members of the

882
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,450
community the better but I think when it

883
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,040
comes I think that the issue of like

884
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:49,960
getting agreement and calling consensus

885
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,460
and you know somebody invoke the ITF

886
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,950
process so that maybe there's appeals

887
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:58,900
and you know I think that there's I

888
00:40:53,950 --> 00:41:00,850
think that the that and I think this

889
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,980
this is kind of a principle that comes

890
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,839
out in the proposal that the idea is to

891
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,460
have this be kind of a community driven

892
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,770
thing and that it will feel more like a

893
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,270
community driven thing if folks who are

894
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,000
sort of in the current administration

895
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:15,009
and leadership aren't in the

896
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,350
administration leadership of the effort

897
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:19,840
so you're saying the are sock members

898
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,730
should not be up for consideration as

899
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,810
chairs of whatever this is going to be

900
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,400
that would be my

901
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:30,160
personal opinion yes would that extend

902
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:32,440
to the IB members as well yeah yep and I

903
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,779
think that was also in in the draft that

904
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,230
these need to be community members not

905
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:39,370
IAB not our shot Martin yeah so I'm Alan

906
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:41,530
Thompson I think a lot of this

907
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:43,540
discussion has been really constructive

908
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:45,760
and and good I think it really goes to

909
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,960
the center of the question which is how

910
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,300
do we build this process that has

911
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,920
legitimacy to the extent that we can

912
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:55,540
rely on the decisions that it makes and

913
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,400
the question of whether I be members are

914
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,130
chairs of this processes is I think

915
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,440
critical if if the IAB are going to be

916
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,910
for instance on the appeals chain which

917
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,050
is something you haven't mentioned in

918
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:09,730
your document then I can't see that any

919
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,040
there being any way of putting them in

920
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,590
both tiers of that chain I don't think

921
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,779
that makes any sense at all for the

922
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:19,570
legitimacy of the process we don't put

923
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:22,150
area directors as chairs of working

924
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:25,060
groups that they oversee themselves and

925
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:26,980
generally speaking we don't have area

926
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:30,040
directors as working group chairs period

927
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:34,450
because of the requirement to have this

928
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:37,620
sort of second level check which gets me

929
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:41,770
to the next point a lot of this rides on

930
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,240
who we put in this critical consensus

931
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:48,190
calling position

932
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:51,129
I assume that the responsibility for

933
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:54,400
assigning those individuals will also be

934
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:56,050
on the IEP as a whole is that the a

935
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,060
group is that what people in this room

936
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:01,110
are assuming because I'm hearing a lot

937
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:03,880
of assuming and know not a lot of saying

938
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:06,670
explicitly so I can clear that up

939
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,690
thought I had put in the draft that the

940
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:13,420
IID would I didn't write it down I was

941
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:15,250
thinking it really hard that the ID

942
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,500
would appoint the chairs but they would

943
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:21,340
appoint the chairs after like sending

944
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:23,680
out a a call for both volunteers and

945
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:26,170
feedback on on the individuals to the

946
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,730
community I think that would be the

947
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,470
responsible thing to do I couldn't find

948
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,740
it just scrolling through the document I

949
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,750
did find the fact that I passed ITF

950
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,189
chairs would be a good one you said you

951
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,190
removed that don't they

952
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:41,200
okay then I pulled my bo3 that I haven't

953
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:43,750
posted yet maybe there's some draft

954
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,680
sitting around some way that has the

955
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:52,300
text it's right over there all right

956
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:54,520
Thank You Steven hi Steven Farrell but I

957
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,869
think any member who wanted to try and

958
00:43:54,520 --> 00:44:01,930
chair something I this would be a total

959
00:43:55,869 --> 00:44:04,480
lunatic in just one point I thought rich

960
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,368
I almost touched on it but I think it

961
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,040
would be good to give some clarity to

962
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:10,510
the IAB as to when you're if the ivy is

963
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,759
picking chairs are doing something in

964
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,109
this space are forming a program I think

965
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,420
it would be good to get some input as to

966
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:18,069
plain you would like that to happen

967
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,890
because I just don't want to see the I

968
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:23,619
be surprising the community yeah so

969
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:26,500
telling us when to do stuff as well as

970
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:27,910
well so we don't kind of think we know

971
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,800
to do it now and other people don't

972
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,859
think that would be I think a really

973
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,359
good thing to do okay so yeah avoiding

974
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:37,569
the IAB surprising the community again

975
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,640
is a really good thing to do words to

976
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:44,470
live by

977
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:47,049
Randy Randy Bush I know this is not an

978
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:50,169
ITF meeting because I did not see the

979
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,609
note well no it was well I did I'm sorry

980
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,890
I thought this was the social

981
00:44:51,609 --> 00:45:01,180
engineering task force nope I did it and

982
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:03,430
I think we have a tension between it was

983
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,069
the I star that got us in this pickle

984
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:13,419
but we want the wisdom of some of them

985
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:17,079
to get us out of this pickle and I don't

986
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,940
think engineers are fungible I think

987
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:25,869
that assumption is part of what got us

988
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:27,910
in this pickle and sorry further its

989
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:30,550
obscure English term fungible means

990
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:33,009
exchangeable you can just take a senior

991
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:38,880
person and throw them out and issue a

992
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:38,880
contract and I think

993
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:50,279
what sue said I don't need to repeat it

994
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:53,670
Thank You Annie mark hi I'm Mark

995
00:45:50,279 --> 00:45:57,269
Nottingham I like I think the gentle

996
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:59,369
approach outlined is fine and I'm

997
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:01,288
rereading it and then reading some parts

998
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:05,579
the first time perhaps from at least my

999
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:08,039
memories bad it's apparent to me just by

1000
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,420
listening between the lenses that were

1001
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:11,099
here that that you know there are still

1002
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,849
a lot of strongly felt healing feelings

1003
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:19,109
here and I'm a little nervous about the

1004
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:21,960
proposal in that it's it's saying that

1005
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:25,619
this is a program of the IAB and it's

1006
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,749
gonna run on consensus as defined rough

1007
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:30,119
consensus as defined in Pete's document

1008
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:33,299
which is it not standards track it's

1009
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:35,999
it's informational and that's a process

1010
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:38,849
that I personally I love that document

1011
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:41,339
and it did perhaps I love it because it

1012
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:43,259
puts a lot of power in chairs hands high

1013
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:45,150
you know the chair has to make a call

1014
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:47,369
sometimes and the document explicitly

1015
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,950
lays out that you know there are cases

1016
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,999
where there are five people who are

1017
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:53,279
correct and there are a hundred people

1018
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:54,450
who are wrong and you go with the five

1019
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:56,220
because they're the ones who have made

1020
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,439
the technically correct argument and I

1021
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,930
think that's a again a fantastic

1022
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,900
document but in the dynamics of this

1023
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:08,339
situation that puts a tremendous amount

1024
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,930
of power in the chairs hands and what's

1025
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:11,910
making me nervous is not necessarily

1026
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,950
that but that in combination with the

1027
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:17,069
fact that the appeals chain is very

1028
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:19,950
fuzzy I am worried that we're gonna get

1029
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:21,450
to a situation where this group comes to

1030
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,339
some rough consensus by that definition

1031
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,529
and it's gonna be rough I don't think

1032
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:27,210
everybody's gonna agree and somebody's

1033
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:29,069
going to be unhappy or a group of people

1034
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,259
are gonna be unhappy and they're gonna

1035
00:47:29,069 --> 00:47:33,329
want to take it forth and it's not

1036
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:35,460
defined explicitly but because it's an

1037
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:38,190
IB program it'll probably get taken

1038
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:40,289
forth to the IAB and then passed that

1039
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:43,769
because it's an IAB program it gets even

1040
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:47,039
fuzzier and so that could be a recipe

1041
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:48,328
for a really bad situation so I would

1042
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,309
ask you to think a little bit more

1043
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:52,230
carefully about explicitly laying out

1044
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:54,280
how that kind of situation would play

1045
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:57,280
out at least so that we go into it under

1046
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:01,150
standing that's a risk mm-hmm

1047
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:05,770
what I was hoping with using a little

1048
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:07,870
bit of author license is my my

1049
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:11,620
observation of the community over the

1050
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:13,810
last eight years is that it each group

1051
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,630
as they try and define you know what

1052
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,890
consensus is going to be it gets

1053
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,170
squirrely and I wanted to just cut that

1054
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:22,690
conversation right out and say look you

1055
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,760
know this this is a reasonable way so

1056
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:26,710
use this don't have that conversation

1057
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,920
about what what is consensus in this

1058
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:32,350
forum and that in a way that's what the

1059
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,170
role of the I be would be is when

1060
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:37,299
consensus is called by the chairs if

1061
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,160
there's any issue with how that was done

1062
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,800
and if it wasn't done according to the

1063
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,899
guidelines as set that's where the I be

1064
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,020
should be stepping in and saying wait

1065
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,900
something broke and I think that's good

1066
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:52,240
I think maybe just spell that a little

1067
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:55,690
more explicitly that you know the IAB is

1068
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,600
that has that role and if there is a

1069
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,580
role beyond that it would be good to say

1070
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,799
that and if there isn't it would be good

1071
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,690
to say that but but let's not get into a

1072
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,840
situation where it's unclear and we're

1073
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:11,560
already in a crisis sounds good

1074
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:14,020
Martin and then I'll try and sum up yeah

1075
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,060
so I'm not insulting I'm worrying

1076
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,250
worried a little bit about the level of

1077
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,920
formalism we have around this specific

1078
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:24,760
document so what I what I'm hearing here

1079
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:27,610
is that we're getting what in in my view

1080
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,350
at least this room is largely coming to

1081
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:32,020
the conclusion that the document that

1082
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:36,220
you the proposal that you have is sound

1083
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:39,610
might need a few tweaks but is basically

1084
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:44,770
sound the process by which we formalize

1085
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:47,260
that agreement is a lot of what the rest

1086
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:49,170
of this process rests on and it suffers

1087
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,510
from exactly the same problems as the

1088
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:54,880
process that it's trying to formalize so

1089
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:59,260
I'm going to put out there that this

1090
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,550
document is updated maybe one more time

1091
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,740
maybe two more times and we talked about

1092
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:06,220
it just a little bit more on the mailing

1093
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:08,149
list and and and and so we can flush out

1094
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:09,769
any final problems

1095
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:14,259
but then it goes no further than that

1096
00:50:09,769 --> 00:50:17,808
listen this is not an RC this is an

1097
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:20,809
agreement that will not be formalized to

1098
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:21,949
the extent that it requires we answer

1099
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:25,309
the question of which stream it's

1100
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:26,989
published on I am right there with you

1101
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:29,299
and actually on the are sock agenda on

1102
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:31,009
Thursday I point-blank asked you know

1103
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:32,180
the are Sox opinion they don't they

1104
00:50:31,009 --> 00:50:32,689
don't know this yet they haven't seen

1105
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,569
the slides

1106
00:50:32,689 --> 00:50:37,489
um do I publish this document you know

1107
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:38,989
do I request it be published I agree

1108
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:42,170
with you I'm not actually sure it should

1109
00:50:38,989 --> 00:50:43,640
be published as an RFC I think having it

1110
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,989
written in a familiar structure as an

1111
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,538
internet draft makes all the sense in

1112
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:50,269
the world but I don't I don't see it as

1113
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:53,599
an RC yeah and and and the reason I say

1114
00:50:50,269 --> 00:50:54,439
that is that it's it's an awkward

1115
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,650
position to be in

1116
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:59,479
we're going to be depending on the

1117
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:03,009
procedures that are written down in this

1118
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:06,948
document and if we do for instance cite

1119
00:51:03,009 --> 00:51:09,380
the consensus and humming ROC there now

1120
00:51:06,949 --> 00:51:13,400
that may be part of the formal process

1121
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:15,140
that this follows and if there are

1122
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,479
appeals those appears we'll have to

1123
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:20,150
consider that document so it's a little

1124
00:51:17,479 --> 00:51:22,549
bit awkward but as long as everyone here

1125
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,869
and and on the mailing list are

1126
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:26,509
comfortable with that I think we can

1127
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:28,849
proceed I think it comes back to you

1128
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:32,269
know first order of businesses do the

1129
00:51:28,849 --> 00:51:33,890
right thing and then the second order of

1130
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:36,109
business is make sure that the process

1131
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:38,118
match is the right thing to do

1132
00:51:36,109 --> 00:51:39,890
you know if needed if it needs to be

1133
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,439
changed

1134
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:43,910
Eric's role um since as we mentioned

1135
00:51:42,439 --> 00:51:45,199
twice I feel compelled to mention that

1136
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,759
document has no normative force

1137
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,170
whatsoever so will be a concrete

1138
00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:53,199
decision to adopt that document is not

1139
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:53,199
part of idea process in any way yes yes

1140
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,558
and I guess I should say I wouldn't be

1141
00:51:56,749 --> 00:52:03,558
in favor of it so you think it must be

1142
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,929
published as an IRC wait I may have

1143
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:07,999
misunderstood that's right what I'm

1144
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:09,259
saying is the consensus of humming

1145
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:11,299
document which Martin is referring to

1146
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,410
it's not a BCP if there's no is not a

1147
00:52:11,299 --> 00:52:14,779
consensus it's not a consensus document

1148
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:20,269
of an ITF process and I don't think we

1149
00:52:14,779 --> 00:52:24,649
should adopt it as a process here okay

1150
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:27,408
I just want to go on the record as

1151
00:52:24,649 --> 00:52:29,719
saying I agree with mark I'm a little

1152
00:52:27,409 --> 00:52:34,519
surprised that we are there was such

1153
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:35,869
brouhaha over our sock and IAB and all

1154
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:37,848
this good stuff in the summer and yet

1155
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:40,819
we're back following trucking down a

1156
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:43,699
process that puts things back in the

1157
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:45,469
hands of the IAB and so that's fine we

1158
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:48,019
can totally agree to do that but I think

1159
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:50,239
we should be extremely crystal clear as

1160
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:52,609
to exactly what that means and what that

1161
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:54,379
doesn't mean so we don't get halfway

1162
00:52:52,609 --> 00:52:56,239
down or into the homestretch and went

1163
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:59,449
consensus is rough and I totally agree

1164
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,009
with that too everybody's not freaking

1165
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:02,929
out over whatever they're going to freak

1166
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:06,399
out about because it was clearly

1167
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:09,399
painfully stated at the top of the hour

1168
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:09,399
okay

1169
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:20,920
as I said earlier I think the IB is

1170
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:22,450
totally willing to follow what the

1171
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,980
community wants to do here including

1172
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:26,529
following the process you've outlined

1173
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,990
and one simple way to do that might make

1174
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,780
might mean taking the meat of what

1175
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:34,569
you've written and the I be agreeing

1176
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:38,050
that the output should be the program

1177
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:40,720
description and that means that we have

1178
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:42,070
the community process that led to it in

1179
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,040
forming the description of the program

1180
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:46,450
that the IB will then use to guide its

1181
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,950
understanding of it as it goes for it

1182
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:49,450
and that's particularly important

1183
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:51,700
because the IB will have a large change

1184
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,950
over this year there are several people

1185
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,930
who are not returning and so the result

1186
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:58,569
of that will be it would be very useful

1187
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:01,330
to have this community process any IAB

1188
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:03,940
program description so that the new IEP

1189
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:09,040
coming in is firmly aware of what the

1190
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:11,800
community expects sounds good what's her

1191
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,330
Tucker is a I'd like to propose that all

1192
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,730
meeting rooms have only one microphone

1193
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:19,890
so I know where to walk through because

1194
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:22,330
it keeps switching yep sorry

1195
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:26,950
the offhand comment doesn't need a loud

1196
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:29,259
echo anyway I've been thinking about you

1197
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:31,149
know how one of the things that keeps

1198
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,830
sort of reoccurring in this conversation

1199
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,480
is the notion of bias and the fact that

1200
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:36,340
we have all of these different parties

1201
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,590
that have a very vested interest in this

1202
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,300
outcome and the reality is is that all

1203
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,370
the people that want to contribute to

1204
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,320
the discussion likely are coming from a

1205
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:45,880
source of bias regardless of whether

1206
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,170
they're on a board now whether there

1207
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,630
used to be on a board whether on their

1208
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:51,760
committee now you know everybody has a

1209
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:53,530
notion of where they're coming from and

1210
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,380
and the only way that you can get around

1211
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:58,120
a situation where almost all of the

1212
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,100
participants in a discussion have bias

1213
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,180
is to make sure that all of the biases

1214
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:05,560
included as a balance point and so one

1215
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:07,330
of the thoughts that I came to is we you

1216
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:08,950
know we typically we've been we've been

1217
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:11,350
talking about chairs but we haven't

1218
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:12,750
talked about number of chairs and so

1219
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,100
when you look at other models like

1220
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:17,320
Supreme Court's and various countries

1221
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,970
you know they include lots of different

1222
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,340
viewpoints with lots of different bias

1223
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:22,990
so that when a decision is made like

1224
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:26,620
calling for consensus or something like

1225
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:28,180
that both sides get to you know to

1226
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,930
declare their opinion there's a some

1227
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,160
sort of vote

1228
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:31,720
then they you know there's dissenting

1229
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,640
opinions published and you know the

1230
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,828
United States now has nine Supreme Court

1231
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,480
justices they used to have five and four

1232
00:55:35,829 --> 00:55:39,839
before that I don't know what the right

1233
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,790
number is but it sure seems to me like

1234
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:45,069
one way around some of this this

1235
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,829
processes that actually include a lot of

1236
00:55:45,069 --> 00:55:49,480
different biased viewpoints so that when

1237
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:51,609
a decision is made and hopefully it

1238
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:54,569
would be unanimous you'd have a much

1239
00:55:51,609 --> 00:55:56,619
better faith in that final decision that

1240
00:55:54,569 --> 00:55:59,130
that's an interesting idea

1241
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:02,470
my first concern would be of course

1242
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:06,280
ending up instead of coming together as

1243
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:09,129
informing compromises and whatnot is you

1244
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,800
end up with this logjam of too many

1245
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:13,450
people who just won't let go we'd have

1246
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,670
to see all right Mike your last person

1247
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:17,919
okay Mike st. John's

1248
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:20,920
what's popped up something and it's

1249
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,230
actually not the worst idea I've heard I

1250
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:26,050
I'm sorry I didn't need to say it that

1251
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:28,030
way there's a model that's used for

1252
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:30,609
mediation sometimes where each side

1253
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:33,190
picks mm-hmm they're their person and

1254
00:56:30,609 --> 00:56:35,740
then the two people agree upon a third

1255
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:39,250
that may be a model for this particular

1256
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:43,348
thing where we we we bring that down and

1257
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:43,349
then the vote is on those three people

1258
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:51,329
Harold it better be short because I want

1259
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:55,240
to sum up chairs are supposed to be

1260
00:56:51,329 --> 00:56:58,869
facilitators of reach finding the group

1261
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:01,689
consensus having voting chairs would be

1262
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:07,109
a completely new process in ITF contexts

1263
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:07,109
okay I don't want to have a 5 to 4 volt

1264
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,240
cage match at the chair table is not a

1265
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,470
good idea

1266
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,808
agree okay um this was a really really

1267
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:19,899
helpful conversation I think and and

1268
00:57:16,809 --> 00:57:22,990
thanks everyone to for keeping it fairly

1269
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:26,319
on point what I'm hearing at the end of

1270
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:28,319
it is you know the as I as I said before

1271
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:30,460
first order of businesses is just

1272
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,670
everyone putting their heart into doing

1273
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,950
the right thing and figuring out some of

1274
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:38,440
the the you know not trying to define

1275
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,848
the process end to end right now because

1276
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,710
we just don't have enough information to

1277
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:46,700
do it it does

1278
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:49,820
sound like an IEP program is is still

1279
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:51,649
more or less the way to go it's it's got

1280
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:54,109
some legitimate concerns and if we

1281
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,800
document what those concerns are we can

1282
00:57:54,109 --> 00:58:01,460
at least say we we consider this this is

1283
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:03,230
where we are worried and as future Ivy's

1284
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,089
look at the community discussion they

1285
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:07,720
can say oh well this this is something

1286
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:10,369
we need to be particularly sensitive to

1287
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:14,299
because of how the community is

1288
00:58:10,369 --> 00:58:16,460
approaching the whole thing I've got

1289
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,890
some work to do in the draft to be a

1290
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:22,190
little bit clearer about what the

1291
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:24,950
appeals process will be and just in

1292
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:28,310
terms and that one I think is kind of

1293
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:33,368
okay to to define earlier rather than

1294
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:33,369
later and I can certainly work on that I

1295
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:38,810
will have that done possibly by the end

1296
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,490
of this week if folks want to talk to me

1297
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:44,089
on the side about anything further

1298
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:46,759
that's totally cool too and I wish you

1299
00:58:44,089 --> 00:58:49,339
all very much the best as you move

1300
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,740
forward with this with this program as

1301
00:58:49,339 --> 00:58:53,990
you participate in it as you define what

1302
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:57,379
the RSC editor model may look like far

1303
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:59,598
into the future thank you for your time
