00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,570
integrate in something that the network

9
00:01:42,119 --> 00:02:05,289
management approach

10
00:01:48,580 --> 00:02:18,700
I finally must approach ok what you want

11
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:22,120
the random you experience okay everybody

12
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,010
we is time to start from it's late

13
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,680
already

14
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,590
so this is a demo session at Norview

15
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,459
networking in the creative model at

16
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:39,880

so yeah approach whatever then we have

18
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,720
that for five years

19
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,000
okay this is not will you should have

20
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,079
that not we all the same not we offer

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,820
five years already

22
00:02:50,079 --> 00:03:01,030
so you should really read it and assume

23
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:05,320
you did and before you can meet him

24
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,630
we have distributed to the blue sheets

25
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,489
around make sure you're signed before

26
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:16,540
you leave the matter how early your and

27
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:19,560
we did jobs crater when we tell it to do

28
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:25,319
that yeah and we did we

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:28,800
means taker went here for that we we

30
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:33,679
have probably last time we we cannot do

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,680
the meeting without a minute taker right

32
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,269
[Music]

okay thanks Michael and we also have two

34
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,580
remote participant machine and all the

35
00:03:51,540 --> 00:04:02,340
slides we got five I believe already

36
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:05,700
uploaded and Manistee is the official

37
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,400
working place all the designs rough

38
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:12,780
consensus we made in a meeting room will

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:17,579
have to confirm animal honest and it

40
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,668
sure is myself King and terrorists okay

41
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:24,780
that's the agenda for yesterday this is

42
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:28,919
a teen defect day we have the working

43
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:35,030
group document updates press key first

44
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:40,010
and we should have the constraint future

45
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:44,099
update as well but we have site and we

46
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:49,320
there's no update but that could means

47
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:59,750
we we slow down the process to reach the

48
00:04:49,320 --> 00:05:01,349
working group consensus right okay oh

49
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,650
okay that's fine

50
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:09,270
no so whatever you can you want to you

51
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:14,900
know take your time is only hams frisky

52
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:21,990
and crowded which traitor at biome and

53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:28,200
the press key AE updates by Stefan and

54
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:33,050
the SME integrating with risky I came

55
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:36,199
back over then the last one without

56
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,220
a draft is dedicated to voter proposed

57
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,530
safe gated future by my Kaka

58
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:47,169
okay that's why I didn't die any at in

59
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,169
the posh why's Christ

60
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:58,099
yeah yeah we mentioned on Tuesday that

61
00:05:54,699 --> 00:06:01,159
if the security ad has time to come in

62
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:03,440
then what would basically give it some

63
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:04,729
minutes to discuss the what he considers

64
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:12,590
to be one of the open points on the a

65
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:16,599
secure with you yes but by looking at

66
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:20,539
this agenda I think we have some

67
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:24,620
possibility to fail earlier so it's not

68
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:27,979
matter whether he has some time it's the

69
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,460
matter whether he catch us before we

70
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,460
undead

71
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,539
[Music]

72
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,749
whiskey update

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:14,039
works today hi you have to put it in the

74
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:15,389
earth yeah that's right yeah and then

75
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,128
somehow if you did it in the wrong order

76
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,379
yep start all over again by rebooting

77
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:23,849
the computer and leaving the room and

78
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:26,849
coming back okay hi so uh update on

79
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,529
bootstrapping key infrastructure it's

80
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:31,560
been my life for three to five three

81
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:34,770
days a week for since the last ITF it

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,710
seems and this is what I told you last

83
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,779
time the various edits and comments and

84
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:46,799
discusses that we received this is last

85
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:50,520
time so this is since then so the we see

86
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,189
there's a button that lets me do the

87
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,758
light yes which remote people can't see

88
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:59,250
of course so the these ones are we got I

89
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,930
got ATS to say something like okay and

90
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:06,509
removed there discusses and new

91
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,419
revisions were posted there's some

92
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,909
wisdom periods of in August with intense

93
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:16,799
discussions mostly with Ben Cooke

94
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:20,150
on the security parts of it ELISA gave

95
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,099
us her okay and then removed it again

96
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:27,599
say pointing out there was a yang doctor

97
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:30,750
review that we hadn't addressed that

98
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:37,939
were they were mostly editorial it's on

99
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:42,089
the yang document that fixed and I'm

100
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:46,829
waiting on okay's friend Roman Ben and

101
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:49,410
ELISA and there's this or periods of

102
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,649
pestering of ATS where I emailed unicast

103
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:56,130
them multiple times not always not more

104
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:59,190
than once a day but you know you kind of

105
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,600
have to do that and get them to pay

106
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,980
attention and you have to know when

107
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,810
they're Telesat SAR so you don't bother

108
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,069
them when they're when they're reading

109
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,930
other people's documents okay so what

110
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:13,000
what did

111
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:17,359
what happened the since the last ITF the

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,580
the abstract got revised part of this

113
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,100
the challenge is I think in abstracts is

114
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,839
how to write it without using the

115
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,459
acronyms that you haven't expanded yet

116
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,170
and you can't expand them in the app in

117
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:33,529
the in the abstract so that's always a

118
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:37,579
challenge there is a mixing xml registry

119
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:39,260
that was added and section 9.1 included

120
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:44,330
operational requirements for the

121
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:46,189
autonomic control plane applicability so

122
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,440
this is a mass operational requirements

123
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,360
domain owner operation requirements

124
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,459
device operational requirements a

125
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,890
section was added called death of a

126
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:58,089
manufacturer which what happens to the

127
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:00,680
devices if if the manufacturer goes away

128
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:02,649
willy loman is a character from Death of

129
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,930
a Salesman if you don't know that

130
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,060
there's a diff of the thing if you are

131
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:13,099
have this slides downloaded and want to

132
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:15,170
load that and you can see the diff 11.6

133
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,880
expanded to include another situation

134
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,410
from the manufacturer where if the

135
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,290
manufacturer

136
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:26,689
you know messes up and loses his Massa

137
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:28,939
or see a signing Keys you know I don't

138
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,420
know fire whatever they didn't do it

139
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,730
right we started the terminology

140
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,469
alphabetically I guess we had been

141
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,870
adding the terminology any kind of

142
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,470
grouping as to with related terms that

143
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,660
were seemed related together so at some

144
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,430
point that made sense to us and clearly

145
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:51,319
it didn't make sense anymore just

146
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:53,060
sorting it made sense after that there

147
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,490
were many TAS that weren't expanded

148
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,619
before they were used we fixed that

149
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:02,270
added a reference for RESTful API is

150
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,770
that actually was a bit difficult to

151
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,800
find an appropriate reference that

152
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:09,829
worked out left the reference for 802

153
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,170
NIR at the 2009 version despite several

154
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:16,339
people telling us how wonderful the 2018

155
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:19,310
version is I can't download it several

156
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:22,080
of the people I have spoken to have been

157
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,880
unable to download it we

158
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,700
of multiple tickets open with the I

159
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,790
Triple E webmaster who basically clearly

160
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,380
thinks we're idiots and has asked us to

161
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,510
do things like reinstall our browser and

162
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,980
stuff like that because you know that's

163
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,069
obviously the reason why we're getting

164
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:42,390
XML errors from his single sign-on

165
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,190
system is for that reason um so you know

166
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,810
don't ask me what I think of the I

167
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,700
Triple E because I don't think I'm

168
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,180
allowed to the code of conduct won't

169
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:56,460
will would it prevent me from telling

170
00:11:51,180 --> 00:12:00,180
you that figures were I think already

171
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,690
remembered but some descriptions were

172
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,689
missing

173
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,510
we had some comments about the fact that

174
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:12,840
the idea of ID some systems were unable

175
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:16,290
to produce proper eye dev IDs which are

176
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,930
supposed to have a expires on and you're

177
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:24,150
supposed to put in the maximum number

178
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:26,670
which is 99 9 is 29.99 or something like

179
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:28,290
that 1231 that's supposed to be that

180
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,540
date that's infinitely in the future

181
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,380
some of them are unable to do that and

182
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:37,530
we had some comments we had some weasel

183
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,540
words around that and I guess the

184
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,100
conclusion is that in the number of

185
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,910
years since the document started those

186
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:47,700
CAS are been fixed Mudd got published we

187
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,980
fixed those links there was a quite a

188
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,770
bit of I think lack of understanding

189
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,980
among some reviewers that the ACP has

190
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:59,040
ipv6 link local addresses for enrollment

191
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,290
and you can't reach them from outside

192
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,030
that link and that's why the link is

193
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,469
secure because you can't talk to link

194
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:11,490
local addresses unless you're on that

195
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:15,810
link had a bunch of goofs in some of the

196
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:17,370
voter examples one of our original

197
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,920
authors who came up with some of the

198
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,550
concepts this guy named Sten Thor I've

199
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,800
actually never met him but he's known

200
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,630
but other people and after some

201
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,599
consultation among the authors and the

202
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,430
area directors removed him as an author

203
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,370
and we added tourists who actually fair

204
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,290
fair bit of work on editorial thing

205
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,450
over quite a few years on this document

206
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:42,000
there and people complained that the

207
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,380
yang doctor list was not the author list

208
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,140
was not the same as the document we

209
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,460
fixed that we had Hasina dl definitions

210
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:53,640
for pretty much everything at this point

211
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,980
so he fixed it for the I guess I mean

212
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,580
when we started this document grasp was

213
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:02,130
just hesitantly using CD DL to describe

214
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:05,310
itself CD DL is now published and

215
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:07,980
they're doing this so it makes sense to

216
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:11,279
do that we add a CD DL definitions for

217
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:14,370
all of the JSON based stuff so like that

218
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,760
the audit log the telemetry status the

219
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:21,360
enrollment log and there there was a lot

220
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,640
of back and forth about RFC 6120 5 which

221
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,930
basically says you get a CLS certificate

222
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,370
how do you know it's the right one and

223
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,900
we're just saying well you do what

224
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,870
browsers do and apparently that was not

225
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,360
acceptable to say so we add some other

226
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:39,390
text there there's a lot of push about

227
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,940
why can't we just make it TLS 1.3 and

228
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,569
the answer is that from quite a number

229
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,700
of implementers that you know we

230
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,550
received feedback from over a couple of

231
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,950
years including by the way me right I

232
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,500
know there's no there's no TLS

233
00:14:52,950 --> 00:15:00,180
implementations out there that does 1.3

234
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,890
and is FIPS 140 compliant so if you have

235
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,890
the constraint that you can only ship

236
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,800
FIPS 140-2 crypto on your device then

237
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,330
you are limited to implementations right

238
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,370
now that don't support you older

239
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,100
implementations okay and you may know if

240
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,170
you're familiar open SSL for instance

241
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,880
there fips-compliant stuff was supposed

242
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:22,099
to be available for that which for

243
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:24,180
they're 3.0 which will have TLS 1.3

244
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,760
that's supposed to have available in

245
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,479
next summer probably won't happen till

246
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,459
the end of next year so even though yes

247
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,640
their current codebase is totally what

248
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,319
TLS 1.3 your Great Wolf SSL it's you

249
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,500
know they're 1.3 and that's great and

250
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,320
they have a Phipps library as well but

251
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,650
that's not drop incompatible necessarily

252
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,920
to you know certain platforms so what

253
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:52,380
we've said is that TLS 1.2 suffice

254
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,620
but we would really like everyone to

255
00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:01,080
support - we would like them to do 1.3

256
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:05,720
whenever they can and but 1.2 support is

257
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,720
necessary in the various end points

258
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:14,160
there's some other points both

259
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,660
clarifications about manufacturers and

260
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,839
list of manufacturers and things like

261
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,780
that we had did a lot of work to try to

262
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,700
get rid of the the domain ID which shows

263
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,500
up in the audit log which is essentially

264
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:33,810
the abstracted hash of the owner of the

265
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:36,360
of the registrar so we had said it's the

266
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,040
sha-1 hash of the public key or actually

267
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,490
the subject public key info structure

268
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,260
and that comes from RFC 5280 and a

269
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,260
couple other documents that specify

270
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:48,380
sha-1 is that okay or some other way of

271
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,090
calculating it which they don't specify

272
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,270
so the question is we don't they don't

273
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:59,370
want us to say anything about sha-1 and

274
00:16:53,270 --> 00:17:02,960
that's okay but the issue is well if the

275
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:08,970
registrar's certificate doesn't have the

276
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:12,630
subject public key info subject public

277
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,220
key there's a oh I D extension that you

278
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,459
would normally put the fingerprint in I

279
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,680
can't remember the name of it right now

280
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:22,410
but if if you've calculate the CA has

281
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,839
calculated it already using whatever

282
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:29,160
algorithm it likes to do and it puts in

283
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,990
a 16 or 20 byte fingerprint and that's

284
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,530
the thing you used a reference to that

285
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,110
key

286
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,840
so if they've calculated that then we're

287
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,780
good you just use it that's the point if

288
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,929
they haven't calculated it then we all

289
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,100
need to agree on how to calculate it so

290
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,110
that's why you end up with the sha-1

291
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,929
reference because that's what current

292
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,659
things are so we have found a reference

293
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,800
in another document I will have to look

294
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,450
at the document to tell you which one

295
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,060
where they essentially went through the

296
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,770
same problem and the answer is well you

297
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,290
use sha-1 if you haven't figured it out

298
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,980
but please use please calculate it when

299
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,220
you put it when you get a CA key because

300
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,590
you won't have that there and I said I'm

301
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,299
really hoping to run after some more

302
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:13,379
area directors this week and get them to

303
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:15,668
sign off the thing and I just mentioned

304
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,559
I've started two documents on

305
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:23,140
operational considerations for brewski

306
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:25,510
registrar's and brewskie massa and they

307
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,790
expand considerably on some sections

308
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:32,140
that we were asked to put into this

309
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:34,000
document and I had avoided putting that

310
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,580
kind of information in the document

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,049
because I think it could be easily a you

312
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,428
know one to five year fishing trip of

313
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,990
interesting things to say and I don't

314
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:46,090
want didn't want to open that can of

315
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:49,059
worms so I hope that the document is

316
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,470
sufficiently complete about yes there

317
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:52,600
are considerations that you need to

318
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,520
think about but that I'm trying not

319
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,350
trying to to write a cookbook on how to

320
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,280
run things but I am looking for help on

321
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:03,370
that and I'm gonna go on talk about

322
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,059
about constrained voucher for one minute

323
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:09,549
okay okay

324
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,710
yeah all right I could take questions if

325
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,970
perhaps at this point yes it's interrupt

326
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,340
between the different documents so

327
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,970
people can start breathing yeah

328
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,970
questions please

329
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,410
Ryan carpenter I don't have a question I

330
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:29,050
would like to propose a vote of thanks

331
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,600
to mr. Richardson because he's doing

332
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:37,870
enormous amount of work on this thank

333
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:39,429
you the implementations are I've seen

334
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,449
your implementation and a reference

335
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:45,370
Massa registrar them others that are yes

336
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:47,580
so I could have put a slide in that cuz

337
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:58,000
I even had one made for something else

338
00:19:47,580 --> 00:20:00,399
mr. Issa so yes we in fact have had done

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,020
interoperability testing we being the I

340
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,280
guess I'll say the fair hair Alliance

341
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:11,980
which is now part of the ocf between

342
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:16,870
Siemens building technology and nxp sai

343
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:20,700
labs myself and signify was initially a

344
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:23,860
participant but they didn't they I think

345
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:27,820
they they ran out of patience been I

346
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,649
would say at some point and we have

347
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,120
mixed amounts of success between the

348
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,450
implementations mine's only one that's

349
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,370
publicly available but we have we have

350
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,340
some things of interoperating well and

351
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,709
some things have not last at the outlast

352
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,429
ITF you saw one of the documents was the

353
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,560
clarifications of RFC 70/30 about

354
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,570
whether or not things are base64-encoded

355
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,909
and that's some of the stuff that came

356
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,810
out of that because 70/30 basically says

357
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:58,810
he base64 encode things and then market

358
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,700
in a way that HTTP says is forbidden and

359
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,280
then that also confused people in

360
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,140
believing that you should base64 encode

361
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,960
all the brewski vouchers and responses

362
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,190
which there's no reason to so we went

363
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,010
into this thing and to make things more

364
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,470
complicated of course many of the times

365
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:16,330
for debugging of our stuff the debug

366
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:20,590
info that we get out of our programs is

367
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:22,629
base64 encoded so so we're not actually

368
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:26,740
sure for like Oh am I looking at the

369
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:28,600
wire and seeing base64 or did I just

370
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,630
base64 that encode it so that I could

371
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,800
debug the thing right so there's a

372
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,210
couple times when we had

373
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,510
interoperability because we all agreed

374
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:39,100
to base64 things when we

375
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:42,230
actually weren't supposed to right

376
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:46,879
Michael but but how about the real

377
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:50,150
deployments where is actually be so

378
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:56,570
thread is is adopted it for their

379
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:57,890
application server enrollment some of

380
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,929
the participants that I mentioned

381
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:03,770
there's one University that has a

382
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:07,220
research lab have have done this sort of

383
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:13,550
top to bottom with thread

384
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:16,190
there's no production deployments of it

385
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,169
anywhere there's there's demos at

386
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,940
meetings and things like that but

387
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:31,820
there's no there's no production

388
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:32,630
deployment at this point anyway else so

389
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,179
constraint

390
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:41,000
hasn't changed since 105 his arrange a

391
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:43,240
voucher was had was stalled by a couple

392
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,730
of things the major thing was the

393
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,460
progression of the CID yang documents in

394
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,880
the core working group those were

395
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,980
unstuck a little bit at 105 and then

396
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,390
have not progressed again as far as I

397
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:02,000
can tell so where where were we did get

398
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,060
our CID allocation Donna like the last

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,070
day so we have to change our CID our CID

400
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,820
number so these are the indexes into the

401
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:14,270
map of the C bore that tells you maps

402
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:16,010
the the big long strings that we have in

403
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,629
the Jason or they're not big long but

404
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,420
there's strings in the Jason two small

405
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:23,510
integers so they've given us a new

406
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,980
mapping base and that requires that at

407
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,960
least for the examples that we go back

408
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,510
and fix our code and do interoperability

409
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,910
testing again with it and there simply

410
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,460
hasn't been time to do that in addition

411
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:39,350
Peter van der stalk who's not here this

412
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:41,510
week is looking for work so he hasn't

413
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,580
had any time to work on the documents

414
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:46,910
either so there's been no progress on

415
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,800
that but even if all of the the things

416
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,330
that were in our way were not in our way

417
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,490
I don't think any of the authors would

418
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,770
have had time to progress the document

419
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,670
since we have other documents co-op est

420
00:23:54,770 --> 00:24:02,860
is in the iesg discuss so that's a

421
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:05,630
dependency of the constraint voter

422
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:09,560
document and so there's a couple other

423
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:11,870
other documents that are are would limit

424
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:15,710
our progress anyway so there seems no

425
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:18,739
point in running fast and stumbling to

426
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,050
for that document any other questions

427
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,520
about that come to the core working

428
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,409
group and told them to get CID out of

429
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:30,350
the way read the dot the CID document if

430
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:34,490
you want this one to progress yeah yes

431
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:39,740
and no I still have problem for the note

432
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:43,790
so ProQuest Wow okay yeah because TV you

433
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:46,010
also you know propose some other new

434
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:50,810
work sure

435
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:53,150
so I hear what you're saying is is is

436
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:55,669
how dare I do new work when I haven't

437
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:59,780
finished my old work yeah so I take your

438
00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:04,100
point and you're absolutely right

439
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:06,500
and my my feeling is I have to fix my

440
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,570
code before I can produce examples and

441
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,840
that is unfortunately a different

442
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:14,600
mindset for me than writing documents or

443
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,730
editing documents but I haven't fixed

444
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,379
the code and the other documents suck

445
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,540
too you notice that the other ones are

446
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,980
pretty bad so so not exactly you're

447
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,480
doing a lot of work anyway but it's at

448
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,480
least one other document has another

449
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,940
author which is the sixth ish version of

450
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:34,040
the constraint voucher has a new author

451
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,050
who has a lot of enthusiasm and energy

452
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:41,450
and so hopefully make some progress on

453
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:43,669
that as well yeah free respect you work

454
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:46,660
at you logic and sense for your

455
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:50,180
conversion to a working group but as

456
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:53,930
working group chair but I can do a you

457
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:57,230
know for my copies I'm not willing to

458
00:25:53,930 --> 00:26:00,170
adopt your new newly proposed work at

459
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:02,420
you you tell me you have enough energy

460
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,070
to do so sure that's totally reasonable

461
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,480
I totally respect that and I think

462
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,909
that's a really good policy for the

463
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,340
group I agree with you completely

464
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:19,720
okay we're done here we don't have shoes

465
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:19,720
okay thank you next

466
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:31,949
is this about the slides you send emails

467
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:34,948
with me with us that there are misses no

468
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:34,949
okay

469
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:13,090
then I just melt them now then five

470
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:15,940
minutes another motion no let's do the

471
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,720
equi stuff first and then I'll upload

472
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,720
the cloud and

473
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,990
of always figuring this out what this is

474
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,490
it's an this tact was presented or a

475
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,429
variation to this tech was presented in

476
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:19,240
you and was presented IT f-105 as well

477
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:20,950
what it is is it shows how acne and can

478
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:25,510
be used for multi to enable multiple

479
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:26,260
different how acne can be used to

480
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,040
integrate multiple different

481
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,200
integrations for facilitating client or

482
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,610
device Church enrollment and the one

483
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,929
that's interesting here is search

484
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,928
enrollment with these two-year brewski

485
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,250
so yeah so so basically and it can be

486
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:53,950
integrated multiple different existing

487
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:55,600
content device enrollment mechanisms the

488
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:59,919
one that's of interest here is brewski

489
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:01,570
or est next slide and so what the acne

490
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,200
integration staff does cover is it

491
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:07,178
covers how acne can be integrated ste

492
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,820
brewski boost the new risky cloud

493
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:12,130
registered raft and teeth and there's a

494
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,990
new draft 40 pop date and the one that

495
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,490
we'll touch on here is EST because

496
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,830
brewskis based on top of that for this

497
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,950
Freddie Norman piece anyways next slide

498
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:23,230
and so we presented this last time

499
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:25,299
around what's changed is and an acne

500
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,580
subdomains part has been broken out and

501
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:29,410
I was requested at the acne working

502
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,960
group and well but acne for subdomains

503
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:34,809
does it's a nice optimization it enables

504
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:36,669
a acne client to prove ownership of a

505
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:38,290
parent domain and then issue search

506
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:40,090
enrollment requests for hundreds or

507
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:43,059
thousands of clients after so after

508
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,649
parent am in and also we've added the

509
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:48,850
brewski crowd huge kiss has been added

510
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:52,690
to acne integrations next so you had the

511
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:54,549
two met the two main and protocols doing

512
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:58,360
that we can integrate acne with is e ste

513
00:29:54,549 --> 00:30:01,059
and T so both east G and T describe the

514
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,860
protocol for how the client or the

515
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:05,799
device interacts with the each server

516
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,600
that each server with both protocols its

517
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,879
out of scope filed the server interacts

518
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,918
with the back end CA so we can plug in

519
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,919
acne into that next

520
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,689
okay so this is a bit of an eyeful but

521
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:24,270
it's it's straight out of the strata the

522
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,610
specs on the left-hand side is just

523
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:31,440
border packing it shows how an ACME

524
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:34,110
client can interact with an acne server

525
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,300
improve ownership of a parent's domain

526
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,050
and on this joint example of domains

527
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,550
that come here

528
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:40,139
and it does at fire well as most

529
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,730
unlikely reason by which you can do it

530
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,270
but the mechanism showing here is simply

531
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,890
by publishing a text record to DNS and

532
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:49,050
proving ownership of the DNS domain and

533
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,540
on the right hand side what I'm showing

534
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:53,129
and this is actually this the picture on

535
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,570
the right hand side is from the previous

536
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,550
version of the acme draft and it's

537
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:01,379
missing something and what it's showing

538
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:03,240
is how a pledge our client when it's

539
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,940
interacting with an ESD or a or a

540
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,120
brewski registrar how the client can

541
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,310
send easting sympton will request to the

542
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,080
RA and what it should be doing first is

543
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,030
sending a CS or a trapinch request the

544
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,080
csr attributes request is documented in

545
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,540
the latest version of draft

546
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,550
it's just now shown this light it sends

547
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,560
an e CS or attributes request gets

548
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,169
response then sends a nice T symptom

549
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,210
roll request to the RA and it's the same

550
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:30,240
enroll request that sent for brewski as

551
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,190
well as baseline EST and the or a can

552
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,050
then turn around and interact with AK

553
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,330
means and the New York requests send the

554
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:38,820
finalized request and send a certificate

555
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,949
request if necessary can reply with a

556
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,929
two or two and if it's gonna take a long

557
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:46,770
time for the surgery issued but a longer

558
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:48,900
time interval and once Acme is issued a

559
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,490
certificate then the RA a just turns

560
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:54,660
around and replies to the simple Road

561
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,160
request with a with a pkcs7 response and

562
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,530
that's pretty much it right so on the

563
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,940
left hand side we have standard e is key

564
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,710
or standard brewski and the right hand

565
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,570
side who stand Arachne there's no

566
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:06,300
changes required why the protocol it is

567
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:08,040
to work and the one optimization that

568
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,389
has been proposed and it's been

569
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,220
discussed at Wharton Group and actually

570
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,650
and Friday exactly for subdomains which

571
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,990
is really useful optimisation for

572
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:17,700
issuing device ID certs and but apart

573
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,980
from that there's no reason why we can't

574
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,210
block these two protocols together

575
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:25,100
there's no reason why we can't plug acne

576
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,100
into teep as well next slide

577
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,460
and so what's missing from this is is

578
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,919
security considerations but I think the

579
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,080
big open question is like this

580
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,690
integration spans across the acme the

581
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,240
EMU and the Panama working groups

582
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,650
towards this dock live and quite a few

583
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,750
people have expressed interest in if

584
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,700
there's interest in EU does interest in

585
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:49,370
acme there's been interest here as well

586
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:54,260
and towards the dock belong and how we

587
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:56,689
bring it forward has the document being

588
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:02,720
presented in these other working any new

589
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:05,270
yes menu and so what what it was oh an

590
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,980
emu an emu in order for this to work

591
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,980
clean e believe me we actually do need a

592
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,970
couple of updates to teep so II new

593
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,590
working group our supportive offer but

594
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,750
want to tape updates to happen the first

595
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:22,189
before we can cleanly integrate teeth

596
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:24,290
with acne and and mu are considering

597
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,240
well once the tick mark is done it may

598
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,700
make sense for this acne integrations

599
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,170
draft to live in in you don't know I

600
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,430
don't wanna have the same conversation

601
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:35,110
on Friday at the acne working group

602
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:40,790
right okay I'll try to be there

603
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:43,520
electives France yeah Howie is this you

604
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:48,500
dis about the economy integration yes

605
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:51,980
okay I have a question and if you I want

606
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:56,150
to know the the the exact use case of

607
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:58,640
this acne application you mean the the

608
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,340
CA is some public CA so you need to use

609
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,470
a comb into okay well well acne is just

610
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,060
a protocol it may appear public see yeah

611
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,500
but there's no reason for private

612
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,290
enterprise CA couldn't support acne as

613
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,960
well so yeah I I just want to ask you

614
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:15,050
this if who is a private the CA and so

615
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,550
it's exactly this kind of economy

616
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:20,090
extensions TR pickable

617
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,460
oh oh actually we don't need this kind

618
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:25,430
of you

619
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:28,280
it's kind of academics tension well it

620
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:30,529
really it really depends on what the

621
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,370
private interfaces the private CA

622
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:36,200
supports like for example well what we

623
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,929
see typically most of our customers were

624
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,040
on Microsoft's private see that's what

625
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,960
we see

626
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,730
to integrate what microsoft CA you have

627
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,310
to integrate with the cost from

628
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,300
proprietary it the eyes and which means

629
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:49,549
if you actually want to do an

630
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,290
integration to microsoft CA you need to

631
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,139
get an SDK and build a custom

632
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:56,179
integration onto your RA to integrate

633
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:58,910
with microsoft CA out there there are

634
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:02,090
some CAS that do support acne that you

635
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,950
can deploy on premise or not let's

636
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,590
encrypt in the cloud you can deploy and

637
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,379
Acme on-premise and what this does is if

638
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,000
it's a if the custom a private CA you

639
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:12,290
can deploy on premise support act make

640
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:22,930
this just a standard way of integrating

641
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:26,029
that with any RA okay okay so have you

642
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,529
are you interested to to ask for

643
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,960
adoption in the different working groups

644
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,730
is that your current status you think

645
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,470
it's ready for adoption

646
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,940
whichever working group but but but you

647
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,990
think it well I don't I don't know it's

648
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,240
I don't think it's ready for adoption

649
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,129
yet and what we need to find out where

650
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,660
it lives first so we can get the right

651
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:43,810
people to do a proper with you and

652
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,460
suggest changes before we can adopt it

653
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:49,580
so well I think the fear is given how it

654
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:51,320
kind of spends across yes you want to

655
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,910
have reviews from the different working

656
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:56,090
groups anyhow or wherever it's being

657
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:57,830
adopted it's probably good to hear

658
00:35:56,090 --> 00:36:00,860
always keep it these are two of the

659
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:04,490
working groups updated on it absolutely

660
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,960
yeah so I'm looking for some advice and

661
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,689
what's the best way to tackle this I

662
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:13,820
mean do we go back to sec dispatch and

663
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:15,770
our sect dispatch what to do it well so

664
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,540
as far as is us is concerned remind us

665
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,600
after this event in terms of you know

666
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,370
that is what group chairs are maybe it's

667
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,080
a simple send an email to the working

668
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,000
group tutors for acne anime and you you

669
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,710
and say go yeah it's like we do yep so

670
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,230
that we at least kind of just

671
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:34,130
administrative ly figure out what

672
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:36,620
opinions we have yeah so so are having

673
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,020
exactly the same discussion on Friday at

674
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:42,049
acne because we all be presenting acne

675
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,820
subdomains and Friday and just briefly

676
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,960
mentioning this then after that maybe

677
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:49,040
it's just bring to the three chairs

678
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:52,960
mirrors and see Michael Richardson

679
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,480
I think it probably belongs to acne I

680
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,030
think that

681
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,910
if there's some I think that the only

682
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:06,540
issue I think is going to be working

683
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:11,129
group milestones and load in which case

684
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:13,859
asking SEC dispatch might be the useful

685
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,630
thing but I don't think it's I don't

686
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:17,250
think it makes less of us I think I

687
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,130
think you wind up in acne I think that's

688
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:26,849
the right right answer yeah um can you

689
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:28,410
say why um because I think that I think

690
00:37:26,849 --> 00:37:30,180
that there are no protocol different

691
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,589
changes to brewski that it impacts

692
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,950
mm-hmm

693
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:37,230
there you said there are some t changes

694
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:42,470
that are required but as I understand

695
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:44,760
them that's because of validating of of

696
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:50,578
it's the whole conversation about the

697
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:52,079
the TLS certificate and that by thread

698
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:54,270
that's happening right now right

699
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,549
and so you would retry mechanisms and

700
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,160
murmur try memory changes or returning

701
00:37:56,549 --> 00:38:01,799
as recent as unsee user attributes yeah

702
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,509
so so that will have an impact for the

703
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:05,339
document needs to be kept track of there

704
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:08,369
but I'm saying it's primarily I think I

705
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:11,849
think primarily it needs it needs acne

706
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:13,290
acne review rather than other entities

707
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:16,680
review that's why I'm saying I think it

708
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:18,000
belongs there probably goes right so I

709
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,609
don't think we'll get a working group

710
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,890
last call review from acne people was an

711
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:27,450
email for instance yeah right yeah but I

712
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,029
missed the purpose here is just to make

713
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:32,299
this group aware that just works on

714
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,299
going

715
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:51,970
what's the cloud document so you need to

716
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:58,119
refresh then yeah then the title should

717
00:38:51,970 --> 00:39:00,939
change to cloud registrant leave one so

718
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,470
that was v-0 first said you start always

719
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:14,559
numbering with kidding

720
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:27,069
please come back this but these are the

721
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:29,099
slides you're sentencing yes yes all

722
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:29,099
right

723
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:47,859
okay so what this document does is it

724
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:49,840
describes in more detail the operation

725
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,720
of a default risky cloud registrar which

726
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,760
is touched on in the base Brisky draft

727
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,049
but is not really explained any detail

728
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,050
at all the next slide

729
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,110
yeah so so the Brisky draft doesn't

730
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,760
fully specify default collaborates your

731
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:11,470
operations this draft does and well

732
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,520
really what a captures is and most of

733
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,080
the options that are available and

734
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,030
there's a bunch of open items willing to

735
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,580
work through em the two primary use

736
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,040
cases for a cloud registrar are a pledge

737
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:23,200
bootstrapping from allocate a room

738
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,210
location remote from the domain where a

739
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
must register there is no joint proxy

740
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,600
you need to discover the location of its

741
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,400
home registrar and the second use case

742
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,049
is a plague bootstrapping in a location

743
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,890
where there is not yet a registrar and

744
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:38,640
made it may need manual manufacturing

745
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:40,990
assistance in bootstrapping so one is

746
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,390
you're putting in a remote location and

747
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:45,689
two is your booting in a legacy network

748
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:48,190
that doesn't have a modern or a deployed

749
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:50,140
what's the difference between a default

750
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,450
cloud registrar and then non-default

751
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:56,200
well it's a default cloud registrar is

752
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:58,899
when the plague bootstraps it tries to

753
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,669
discard it tries to discover a registrar

754
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,050
on its local domain or the domain it's

755
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,530
bootstrapping in and kind of find one

756
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,150
and there is a default manufacturing

757
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,490
registrar baked into its farmer like

758
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:11,590
it's a it's a it's a Cisco device and it

759
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,700
has registrar that Cisco to come back

760
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,710
into it and I just go to the

761
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,109
manufacturers cloud to find out where do

762
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:21,160
I go next so it's kind of a fallback

763
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:24,130
it's a fallback onea and it's it's

764
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,040
documented in the brewski draft this

765
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:28,990
operation Bowyer says if it does not if

766
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,610
her pledge cannot discover its local

767
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,229
registrar it can fall back to the cloud

768
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,300
but it doesn't really say what happens

769
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,960
after that I think fall back and I

770
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:41,800
wouldn't have asked the question okay

771
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,510
next slide this is current this is the

772
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,330
high level architecture showing all the

773
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:49,270
moving parts and there's multiple

774
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:52,529
different possible signaling permutation

775
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,530
combinations need to be worked through

776
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,720
but the plug is going to connect to a

777
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,480
cloud registrar on bootstrap and request

778
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,879
a voucher the crowd register will

779
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,470
enforce mutual TLS it'll a very

780
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,750
shareable a check to the devices I give

781
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:06,490
ID and the device is going to use a

782
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,060
baked in implicit trust anchored

783
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,890
atavistic

784
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:10,960
check to manufacture II the

785
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,609
manufacturers cloud registrar identity

786
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,740
and there's multiple different choice by

787
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,300
walking up next like does the card

788
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,709
registrar issue a voucher directly or

789
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,710
does the collaboration share 3-xx

790
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:23,800
redirect to the correct local domain or

791
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:26,620
home network registrar and if the fabric

792
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,030
services a voucher directly played a

793
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:30,100
certain role Montek lists a certain

794
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:32,260
romantic place in the cloud or does the

795
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,870
cloud registrar redirect to the home

796
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,760
domains to certain element there and if

797
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,799
search enrollment happens in the cloud

798
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,320
and this is a use case that a buyer very

799
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,170
interested in how does the crowd

800
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,090
redirect the endpoint to its service

801
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,700
domain and that's not specified at all

802
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:50,440
in brewski because brewskis all about

803
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:55,120
attaching to the network not attaching

804
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,220
to services next slide that's the quick

805
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:00,900
question yeah hot one standard aha

806
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:03,759
moment it just mean the local domain Oh

807
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:08,350
one example is you you plug in a device

808
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,600
in your home network and you're Europe

809
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:13,060
you're a remote worker and you want the

810
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:16,839
device to register to your your

811
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:20,560
headquarters okay I mean that's data

812
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,040
also it's a I mean Evita more general

813
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,000
concept

814
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,970
Isis is specifically on the home network

815
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,860
no no no that's it sorry maybe I can

816
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:33,549
plug it it yes I want I want to discover

817
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:36,160
my headquarters or home is kind of an

818
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:38,170
overall the term maybe it's confusing it

819
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,310
wasn't a local local domain something

820
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:43,720
well what are yours you want so your

821
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:45,250
local domain is where you power the

822
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,669
thing up right you've heard it up here

823
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:52,720
in the ITF but what the device you want

824
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:59,400
to actually register to my Cisco office

825
00:43:52,720 --> 00:44:03,459
in Ireland are so so I'm plugged box and

826
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,810
I'm a remote worker I powered up on my

827
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,790
home network I'm a remote where

828
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,250
or connects to the cloud and the cloud

829
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,990
were redirected to the corporate network

830
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:13,650
or the operator network that I want to

831
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,649
connect to

832
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,359
so for home domain or the domain that I

833
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,029
want to connect to not to demand on

834
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:27,160
bootstrap booting up in I'm home domain

835
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,330
requires mutual authentication so the

836
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,149
pledge you must be imprinted with a

837
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,259
trust anchor for the home registrar and

838
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,940
the plague you may need to be imprinted

839
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,920
with the realm or domain information if

840
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,350
the home register is using a identity

841
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,390
circuit signed by a public CA well

842
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,910
that's currently not I'm specified how

843
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:45,790
this could work in vouchers or brewski

844
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:47,560
today and the home registrar must either

845
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:50,320
have visibility to and verified of

846
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,840
actors this issued by a masters bounty

847
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,120
repledge are else the home registrar has

848
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,190
to verify the locally significant

849
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:00,160
certificate that is imprinted onto the

850
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:00,610
device one of those two options are

851
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,470
tariqa

852
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:05,260
just one short question is it possible

853
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:07,720
to have several homes for one physical

854
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,790
device would it be supported because you

855
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,600
know we have this bio two situations and

856
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,640
more and more virtual domains like

857
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,830
within one physical device some kind of

858
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,020
secure environments you know which

859
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:21,610
essentially make the beam to services

860
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,130
like a general Brisky question door

861
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:26,110
right right correct it's a general

862
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,000
question but it would be supported at

863
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:29,890
all because I think today we be faces it

864
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,140
the situation typically right the the

865
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,240
examples that you just have given that

866
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,580
you connect to your let's say Enterprise

867
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,520
is very clear as long as we are let's

868
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:41,650
say in 2005 but somehow today I feel

869
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,680
that my PC can connect to several homes

870
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:47,140
it depends on what role it just plays so

871
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:53,290
I have the secure enclaves right we are

872
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:55,180
supported from the chipsets so correct

873
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:59,020
tory's it's a public good well that's

874
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,310
all my question but sorry as long as it

875
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,540
is that what some of the answers it

876
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:06,790
works at this point there's nothing

877
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,110
there use whatever may be just what L

878
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:10,330
may be the same MAC address would

879
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:15,670
somehow make it not work I don't know

880
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:17,470
I'm just asking a question yeah yeah

881
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,339
like this this this isn't really

882
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:22,109
changing

883
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:32,519
the behavior of a frisky at all yeah

884
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:34,630
next slide so this there's three major

885
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:36,279
deployment and operational models we

886
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,109
want to talk to three major options and

887
00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:39,160
which shopkins make sense should we

888
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:40,660
support all of them should we support

889
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,209
none of them are the questions you need

890
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:45,249
to answer so the first option is when

891
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:48,219
the pledge connects the fallback or

892
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:51,009
default registrar and the card register

893
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:52,869
will do mutual authentication it will

894
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:55,630
verify the idea of ID that's installed

895
00:46:52,869 --> 00:46:57,189
on the page and the collaborator will

896
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,739
have a lookup table so this idea of ie

897
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:04,689
this device and should be redirected to

898
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:06,279
this home registrar the cloud isn't

899
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:08,649
going to issue a bit about your response

900
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:10,239
to cover is gonna do HTTP 3xx response

901
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,430
and redirect the voucher to the home

902
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:14,559
register the vouchers that are sorry the

903
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:16,989
pledge is then gonna do standard brewski

904
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:19,059
flow against the home registrar and send

905
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:21,430
a new value request via the home

906
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:26,920
register okay this is kind of the

907
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:28,660
simplest case next slide so this is

908
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,630
scenario number two where the card

909
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:35,049
register is going to issue a voucher and

910
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:36,359
the home CA is going to issue or the

911
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:38,859
home she is going to issue a local

912
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:41,109
device ID the home she is going to

913
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:43,509
choose local it's significant search so

914
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:45,670
Kyra cherish is a voucher the crowd rag

915
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:47,410
is the next step that the leg is going

916
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,599
to use the pledge is going to start the

917
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,670
est enrollment operation is going to

918
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,679
send the C's or attributes then send an

919
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,509
enroll request so when it sends its

920
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,809
first est operations the card register

921
00:47:55,509 --> 00:48:00,759
the car racer can 3xx worse with three

922
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:03,249
exits and redirected to the home

923
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:04,719
registrar and another option of course

924
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:06,788
is that the voucher could includes the

925
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:10,660
home domain network as a field that's

926
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:12,039
not in there yet either the problem we

927
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:15,788
have here is the voucher issued by the

928
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:17,170
voucher issued by the cloud and is not

929
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:19,869
going to be seen by the home registrar

930
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:22,509
if the crowd just does a simple 3-xx

931
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:23,769
redirect on the uski request how does

932
00:48:22,509 --> 00:48:25,209
the home registrar do you mutual

933
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:26,948
authentication how's the home registrar

934
00:48:25,209 --> 00:48:28,629
cat visibility to the voucher that was

935
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:30,819
issued because the factor that is issued

936
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,049
is going to find the pledge to the home

937
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:35,469
domain and the voucher that is the

938
00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:37,150
you will also have to pledges and serial

939
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:38,410
numbers so there's a couple of different

940
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,059
options for how the home rights track

941
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,709
you get the voucher it could be

942
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:44,349
potentially included as a barrier token

943
00:48:41,709 --> 00:48:45,999
DHCP requests and the home register

944
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:48,549
could potentially fetch the back from

945
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:51,788
the cloud or they look the lowest common

946
00:48:48,549 --> 00:48:53,410
denominator is that the the pledge

947
00:48:51,789 --> 00:48:54,910
identity needs to be explicitly

948
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:56,859
provisioned on the home network as well

949
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:58,779
as in the cloud there's three options

950
00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:03,670
there and we don't know which is the

951
00:48:58,779 --> 00:49:04,959
correct one to take next slide and so in

952
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,729
this scenario the card register is

953
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:11,229
issuing device around the cloud ta also

954
00:49:06,729 --> 00:49:12,848
issues the local a significant search so

955
00:49:11,229 --> 00:49:16,058
there's two problems here right and

956
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:17,589
first how does the cloud Registrar tell

957
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:19,959
the pledge what it's holding service two

958
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:21,549
mayonnaise tanning pledges buzzer home

959
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:24,399
service domain is currently not in scope

960
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:26,979
at all for risky fractures and the

961
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,670
second problem is the certificate that's

962
00:49:26,979 --> 00:49:32,649
issued by the cloud CA and because the

963
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,150
cloud the registrar and the cloud CA

964
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,739
will be redirecting pledges across

965
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,880
multiple different home domains assuming

966
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,519
there's multiple different customers are

967
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,019
you urging this how is that locally

968
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,169
significant certs it'll be names based

969
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:47,919
so that the homeless service domain can

970
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:49,869
do a proper Arabic and policy check if

971
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,319
the for example if the cloud C is let's

972
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:52,929
encrypt

973
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,339
it's not a strong enough policy decision

974
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:56,499
for the homeless services to check that

975
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:57,969
the certificate is from let's encrypt it

976
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:59,109
needs to check out the certificate is

977
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:01,959
from let's encrypt but it's also

978
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:03,130
something named operator comm it's not

979
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:07,779
their open question do we do not know

980
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:09,249
the answer to that's like and this this

981
00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:11,469
is last slide it just summarizes the

982
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:13,779
three different mechanisms by which I

983
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:16,839
fall back or default carb registrar

984
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:19,269
could redirect a pledge to its correct

985
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:24,359
home register error does open questions

986
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:26,410
associated with all three options and

987
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:29,259
the questions we have is how many

988
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:31,209
options should be supported for the

989
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:32,739
options we do support how do we answer

990
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:36,089
the questions that are posed for each

991
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:36,089
one of those options and what we do next

992
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,140
well what water would there's three

993
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:55,919
options on the table which if any of

994
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,058
those three options should we support

995
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,279
like one well

996
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:01,960
the option to support none of them means

997
00:51:00,279 --> 00:51:03,789
that we need to operate whiskey to

998
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,460
remove the default card registrar so we

999
00:51:03,789 --> 00:51:09,339
should be sporting one of them and at

1000
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:11,440
least four for each one of the options

1001
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:13,089
there's a number of open questions that

1002
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,380
need to be answered for each option so

1003
00:51:13,089 --> 00:51:16,259
we need to figure out how we get the

1004
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:23,140
answers for those questions as well and

1005
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:25,240
then what are our next steps okay yeah

1006
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,160
so which options do we support if he's

1007
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,200
working under them then we need to go

1008
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:30,359
back and revisit the brewski Draft so we

1009
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,129
have to support at least one of them

1010
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:35,230
then for the open for the subset of

1011
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:37,240
options we support there's open items

1012
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,559
against each option and then we need to

1013
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,578
investigate what the correct answer is

1014
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:46,059
for those organizers so this seems to

1015
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:52,720
all be trying to no this is too small

1016
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:54,279
for me to read so these options seem to

1017
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,410
to indicate that this is kind of

1018
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:58,660
co-located with the mass I write it at

1019
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:02,319
least in one case and in the other cases

1020
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,848
it's not so does that do those other

1021
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,640
cases

1022
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:08,049
sothey but the crowd syria does not

1023
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,240
necessarily need to be called creator

1024
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:11,740
with the master like for example the

1025
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,029
crowd could be using let's encrypt as

1026
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:18,069
the default CA that's true but the

1027
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:21,460
question is always that you basically

1028
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:23,288
get the IDF ID as the identifier by

1029
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,359
which you're looking up in a database

1030
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:28,720
yes determine yeah so which which is

1031
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:31,420
kind of something that the mass I needs

1032
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,089
to know already right yes so that's

1033
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,650
absolutely or duplicating information to

1034
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:37,839
the same type of information into

1035
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,369
multiple systems if you're not kind of

1036
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,680
considering this as an additional

1037
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:44,859
function co-located effectively with the

1038
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,750
Massa yeah so the de Massa and our crab

1039
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:48,819
racer will have to be pre provisioned

1040
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,650
with the L divide er the end of a key

1041
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:54,250
serial number so that I can type of ID

1042
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:56,440
yeah the ideologic guess sorry proof

1043
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,820
region with the idea of ID or I divided

1044
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,520
a thumbprint or serial number

1045
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:02,610
so that it can read rich right so if I

1046
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:06,220
consider them right located that kind of

1047
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:08,770
sounds the most simple to me which then

1048
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:12,040
begs the question for case two and three

1049
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:15,640
where that seems not to be the case what

1050
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:20,130
the benefits would be over case one

1051
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:23,200
right if it's so correctly I didn't

1052
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:26,290
missing the differences so Mike lurchers

1053
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,029
and so yeah yeah so maybe we Ellis

1054
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,890
trated this poorly by putting the dotted

1055
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:32,230
line between around the masa and the

1056
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:33,910
other thing I was I'm sorry I was my

1057
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:36,100
suggestion to put the three together

1058
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:38,100
like that so that you could see you

1059
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,569
could easily see the differences but

1060
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,880
between the two that they are different

1061
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:46,630
without flipping those slides but

1062
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,720
totalus the the the cloud registrar

1063
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:54,100
could be operated by anybody so an

1064
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:58,509
example would be X Y Zed widgets makes a

1065
00:53:54,100 --> 00:54:00,220
thing sells it on Amazon and then but

1066
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:04,450
the cloud registrar that it uses is

1067
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:05,770
sewers IOT you know think right so in

1068
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:08,620
that case you know there's really a

1069
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:10,990
fairly far relationship between the

1070
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:13,180
different pieces and and there's no

1071
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,649
requirement that the manufacturer run

1072
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:17,890
the cloud registrar there's currently

1073
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:19,600
some efficiencies is probably some you

1074
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:21,819
you know you just dip into the same

1075
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,350
sales database if you want to and stuff

1076
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:25,920
like that but I don't think there's any

1077
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:29,470
strong requirements architectural II in

1078
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,720
to doing that but I need to know if

1079
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:33,459
they're not kind of coming from the same

1080
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,799
source I need to trust two entities

1081
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:37,600
right the manufacturer with a mass and

1082
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,970
the same type of kind of information

1083
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:42,220
with that other party what's the value

1084
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:47,080
meter you need to validate you need to

1085
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:51,819
validate the masses vouchers regardless

1086
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:58,210
that's brewski okay when you go in the

1087
00:54:51,820 --> 00:55:01,150
case of part two or or three but it

1088
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:04,390
particularly two if I can't read it

1089
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:06,340
either then you know there's still a

1090
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:10,940
voucher that's being issued that spins

1091
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:12,890
the Registrar okay so you

1092
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,710
after that the device doesn't have to

1093
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:17,868
actually trust have a trust the cloud

1094
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:21,849
registrar because it's still going to

1095
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:24,290
get pinned by the Massa by the voucher

1096
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:27,200
same as inverse key no difference there

1097
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:29,960
and in in at least one of these cases it

1098
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,848
is a local registrar it's just not local

1099
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,490
to the network you're on so that's the

1100
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:38,030
case where you take your take a company

1101
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:38,899
phone and bring it to IETF your or

1102
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:42,770
something like that

1103
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:44,690
and you want it to work with the with

1104
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,520
your company even though you're not

1105
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:48,470
actually at the company and that's why

1106
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,960
you don't have any anima infrastructure

1107
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,578
to help you get on board it right so

1108
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,280
that's where the manufacturers cloud

1109
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:57,410
registrar redirects you to the local

1110
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,020
registrar though sorry not the local the

1111
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:01,848
company registrar possibly over the

1112
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:04,310
internet but you still onboarding with

1113
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:06,349
that local with that domain specific

1114
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:08,029
registrar Yeah right

1115
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:10,520
you can even do you can you could even

1116
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:12,710
get your L dev ID this and then bring up

1117
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,990
an ACP over the internet if you wanted

1118
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:17,950
to right and and that's entirely

1119
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:20,930
reasonable okay could be completely ACP

1120
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:23,049
uses or well I think I think the may be

1121
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:25,399
the the correct step to help you know

1122
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:27,200
differentiating these is to come up with

1123
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:30,170
a list of possible attack vectors and

1124
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:34,189
how each of them do or do not defend

1125
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:37,609
against those sure so so so in the the

1126
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:39,619
phone case because to the authors at

1127
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:41,900
least I'm gonna speak on that you're

1128
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:44,930
also cell phones right you're in that

1129
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:48,109
your home group right certainly we find

1130
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:51,250
certainly a viaduct a in the case they

1131
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:55,670
there there's no local that's a hosted

1132
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:59,510
PBX solution so they want but but each

1133
00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:02,420
customer has you know gets a stack of

1134
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:05,660
virtual PBX equipments in a in a nearby

1135
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:07,910
cloud nearby public cloud and so the

1136
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,828
manufacturer actually redirects them you

1137
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:12,859
know maybe only three hops down the

1138
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:14,810
street to their PBX system right and and

1139
00:57:12,859 --> 00:57:15,348
they're gonna get onboard into that

1140
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:17,810
system

1141
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:20,990
it just happens not to be within their

1142
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:23,270
building okay that's all but one

1143
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,709
deployment scenario that are Dutch IP

1144
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:27,410
phones need to figure out when you play

1145
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:28,940
so I've taken on people in other words

1146
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,160
box in my home office and I plug it in

1147
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:34,970
for the first time and I could be

1148
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,319
getting service from okay I'll say Cisco

1149
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,819
I could be getting service from a Cisco

1150
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,500
hosted sir it's a Cisco phone I could be

1151
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:43,430
getting service from a Cisco

1152
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:45,830
bolstered virtual PBX I could be getting

1153
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:47,839
service from a service provider it could

1154
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:50,240
be an open service writer are I could be

1155
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,660
getting service from my enterprises

1156
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:57,290
private PBX that have deployed in my HQ

1157
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:59,210
or in their HQ is cloud or my head you

1158
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:01,400
know I think I think all these examples

1159
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:02,869
are fine the next step in terms of what

1160
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,150
happens in the presence of the red

1161
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:06,920
players what what I kind of you know how

1162
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,380
well this is of the solution protect

1163
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,630
well so so so one of the things it

1164
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:15,080
between these these solutions is where

1165
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:21,290
the redirect occurs okay the redirect

1166
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:24,710
can occur before you get a voter after

1167
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:27,950
you get a voucher or when you ask to

1168
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:30,470
enroll I get that right yeah I think so

1169
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,060
or after you actually watch watch we

1170
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,830
thought likes we thought really likes

1171
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:36,230
option three he says that's the easiest

1172
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:39,290
you need to build yeah and I leaned

1173
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:41,450
towards action one so yeah so so what we

1174
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:44,029
don't have is clearly articulated

1175
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:45,770
distinction between the three use cases

1176
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:48,320
we're just pretty sure that we probably

1177
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:51,410
don't need all three we're just not

1178
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:55,970
entirely sure which two to keep now why

1179
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:58,480
I think one of one of the one of the

1180
00:58:55,970 --> 00:59:02,598
answers will be whether the local

1181
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,730
operator wants to run a CA or not yeah

1182
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:06,680
that's that's a good time check here

1183
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:08,950
because otherwise this too interesting

1184
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,950
better

1185
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:23,440
yep

1186
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,940
okay

1187
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,770
so I know we're a little bit behind

1188
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,740
schedule so I'll try to be pretty quick

1189
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:41,060
I am here to try and get this discussed

1190
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:43,580
resolved on the ACP document the RCA to

1191
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,230
need to name aspect is probably the

1192
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,870
trickiest part there's a few other

1193
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:50,750
things that should be pretty mechanical

1194
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:52,190
so summer here is I'm frequently

1195
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,930
confused if I'm confused

1196
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:57,410
getting me unconfused is going to be a

1197
00:59:53,930 --> 01:00:00,129
success I've come here so please be

1198
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:03,859
don't be shy about jamming apples Mike

1199
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:07,220
so just set the stage I'm gonna be using

1200
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:08,870
a be enough accepts my minor tweak to

1201
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,399
make it a little bit more sense I'm just

1202
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:13,880
gonna go through the a be enough and

1203
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,650
then talk about a little bit more so

1204
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,690
breaking down to the little components

1205
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:19,730
we've got this RFC self literal string

1206
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:21,650
that's just sort of saying this is the

1207
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:25,850
type of thing that we're using in our

1208
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:27,710
name and that's sort of my understanding

1209
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:31,190
of it and then we've got the IP address

1210
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:33,680
pretty straightforward and then in the

1211
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:35,840
our sub so we've got this routing sub

1212
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:39,500
domain concept and we have the R sub

1213
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:41,690
string that we append or prepend to the

1214
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:43,190
domain in order to get the routing sub

1215
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:46,400
domain itself and so this RS I was like

1216
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:48,940
a prefix I tried to go back through the

1217
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:51,170
email discussion and through the

1218
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,460
document and the only thing I could find

1219
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,680
that we actually use this for is this

1220
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:58,070
input to the hash and so I forced to

1221
01:00:54,680 --> 01:01:00,230
assume that this is also used in like

1222
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:02,720
the human readable output that we can

1223
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:03,950
get out and extract in a certificate so

1224
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,160
it's like used for organizational

1225
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:10,730
reporting about which part of the

1226
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:12,740
network is this device part of no so

1227
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:14,930
basically the whole idea was that the

1228
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:17,060
local parts would have kind of all the

1229
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:20,569
local attributes that we need in

1230
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:23,299
addition to let's say the the the simple

1231
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:25,850
address stuff and one of the things were

1232
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,640
doing algorithmically out of it is the

1233
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:32,089
calculation of the hash so if we start

1234
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:34,100
saying we have the one security domain

1235
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:36,440
which is coming from the ACP domain name

1236
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,240
right so that's basically for example

1237
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,829
where we we based the trust anchors but

1238
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,049
we're starting with multiple separate

1239
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:44,810
networks then the separate network

1240
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:47,690
should have separate address prefixes so

1241
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:50,839
basically the Arzo creates the ability

1242
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:53,030
to have different address prefixes and

1243
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:54,529
so then these can be easier concatenated

1244
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:56,150
together right so you're basically

1245
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:57,619
saying okay I've got just one trust

1246
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,970
Amina but I need to have five different

1247
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:03,050
networks if they all have the same

1248
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:05,359
addressing prefix then we can't

1249
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:07,369
basically easily partition and put them

1250
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:10,578
together right we get so that it's just

1251
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:14,180
you know some some trick to make you

1252
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:15,500
know the roster for the address

1253
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:19,450
assignments that we can have our

1254
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,450
separate partitions that you know okay

1255
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:26,029
think think of it as some large campus

1256
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:27,950
say I don't know

1257
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:30,920
Cambridge University as you may know

1258
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:35,540
that has sub campuses in other cities

1259
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:39,230
but our wishes to but but doesn't want

1260
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:43,720
to run a ula across all of them okay

1261
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:46,220
however anticipates that possibility of

1262
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,410
multi terabit networking which would

1263
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,450
change their their view on that and so

1264
01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:53,839
they want to make sure that there's not

1265
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:56,390
going to be a overlap or conflict in the

1266
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:59,270
future right so like I guess the address

1267
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:01,640
assignment is the major part of this of

1268
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:03,440
the are so far so yeah so the the use

1269
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,480
case we actually were faced with they're

1270
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,700
talking with customers at that when we

1271
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:09,920
came to these things was you know you

1272
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:11,720
wanted to go autonomic but then you do

1273
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,210
interconnect through a third party like

1274
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:16,189
a layer 3 VPN provider and there you

1275
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:18,650
don't have the autonomic mechanism so

1276
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:20,599
but you wanted to foresee that the you

1277
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,339
know third party service provider at

1278
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:25,280
some point would also be able to

1279
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:26,569
integrate across it so I guess the other

1280
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:29,270
thing comes to mind is that I think we

1281
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:32,540
say that you are not supposed to rely on

1282
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:34,490
the 40 bits of the address prefix

1283
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,000
actually being the hash of this stuff

1284
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:39,799
and so who actually needs this if it's

1285
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,400
only being used for the hash is it just

1286
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:45,500
whatever is doing IP address assignment

1287
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:48,900
so the idea is that that the

1288
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:53,549
administrator types in his domain name

1289
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:57,200
the UI runs the hash okay of that to

1290
01:03:53,549 --> 01:03:59,849
make a ula which presents to him okay

1291
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,490
which for most of people they just hit

1292
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:04,710
next and it's done they never need to

1293
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:06,029
know that again unless they were to

1294
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,349
reconfigure the whole thing in which

1295
01:04:06,029 --> 01:04:11,849
case you get deterministic the same

1296
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:15,749
thing however some of them realize no no

1297
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:18,920
no I'm supposed to use this ula cuz you

1298
01:04:15,749 --> 01:04:20,939
know there was some decision about

1299
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:25,200
previously installed whatever in which

1300
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:28,289
case they over type that that ula with

1301
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:31,078
something that they use last time and

1302
01:04:28,289 --> 01:04:33,269
which case they go forward that way so

1303
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:35,430
at that point yes we generated the ula

1304
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:38,490
from that that string and that's the

1305
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:41,279
default recommendation but we don't want

1306
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:43,799
to ever have anyone else have to run

1307
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:45,630
that hash again in case they've decided

1308
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:47,400
that there's a different address space

1309
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:49,200
they're going to use that make sense so

1310
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:57,059
like we don't necessarily need to put

1311
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:58,169
that in this certificate directly maybe

1312
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,970
I mean you don't have to answer me right

1313
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:01,890
now there's a there's a question I

1314
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:04,980
there's a piece there that that that

1315
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:07,379
that so that the at part become is the

1316
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,960
ACP domain name and that's just you know

1317
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:11,640
like that that's just a rel right and

1318
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:13,680
then we've used that to generate the

1319
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:15,989
address part which we put the other part

1320
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,430
and they're probably related but we

1321
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:19,289
don't want anyone to depend upon it

1322
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:21,239
that's why we put them both there

1323
01:05:19,289 --> 01:05:22,589
so I guess my current thinking is my

1324
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,690
understanding is that we don't really

1325
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:26,190
need this R sub in the certificate but

1326
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:28,950
you know we could think we can think

1327
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:30,779
about it harder not so there is always

1328
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,739
the fine line in terms of figuring out

1329
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:33,809
what is this

1330
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:35,400
you know persistent type of policy that

1331
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:37,529
otherwise would be very hard to

1332
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,509
distribute right because I mean you look

1333
01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:41,339
at something like brewski and if if

1334
01:05:39,509 --> 01:05:44,130
we're trying to have you know core

1335
01:05:41,339 --> 01:05:45,989
bootstrap information you know that

1336
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:47,489
wouldn't be in a certificate then we we

1337
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:50,309
have to reinvent kind of something as

1338
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:51,839
complex as this as brewski and and so

1339
01:05:50,309 --> 01:05:54,210
that's that's a fine line so we try to

1340
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:57,690
minimize it and definitely the RSF is

1341
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:59,910
really at the edge of that information

1342
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:02,160
right and I think at this point in time

1343
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,770
we just feel a lot more comfortable if

1344
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,850
we sure

1345
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:05,230
if we have it in there but it's

1346
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:07,600
certainly something we also need to

1347
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:09,520
explore we didn't have that in initial

1348
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,230
you know pre standard implementations

1349
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,240
but basically there was a lot of

1350
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:16,000
interest expressed to be able to better

1351
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:18,609
address these larger denominator okay

1352
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,190
great so I'm not totally confused about

1353
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:23,830
what this does and then we've got this

1354
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:26,680
extensions part so I've made the

1355
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:32,319
question do we have any plans vague at

1356
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:33,520
all for what the extensions would be we

1357
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,280
don't want to end up in a way where

1358
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,230
somebody does introduce an extension and

1359
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,150
it's not backward-compatible so in the

1360
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:42,910
parser we want to have an ability to be

1361
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:45,820
able to skip over things that basically

1362
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:47,259
can be added later case just the you

1363
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:49,270
know extension points of the parcel

1364
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:51,520
right is just come at it from like the

1365
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:54,130
x5 a nine point of view we're having an

1366
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,410
extension point in the name of the thing

1367
01:06:54,130 --> 01:07:00,520
being certified feels very streams as

1368
01:06:56,410 --> 01:07:03,129
like a cognitive mismatch I mean so like

1369
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:05,110
in the certificate this is going in the

1370
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:08,310
RFC 82 dating Thea so it's like the name

1371
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:11,470
of the thing being certified and so

1372
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:15,670
having an extension point in the syntax

1373
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:17,069
for your name feels a little bit weird I

1374
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:19,330
can sort of see how it might make sense

1375
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:21,460
these people coming in that when I have

1376
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:23,380
the PhD in their name and you say no

1377
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:25,600
sorry you kind of a PhD and we didn't

1378
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:30,010
foresee them the parser that would be a

1379
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:31,690
person named example like and then of

1380
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:33,640
course we're sort of covered the ACP

1381
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:36,160
domain name that's pretty key you know

1382
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:37,750
it it's the tenant of are you part of

1383
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,140
the same domain or not it goes into the

1384
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:43,510
authorization policy is pretty important

1385
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:45,040
so I tried to make a little table except

1386
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:47,710
table formatting and lot tech it's hard

1387
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:51,250
so it's a list and that's basically

1388
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:53,619
summarizing my understanding of what we

1389
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:55,150
talked about the previous slides so if I

1390
01:07:53,619 --> 01:07:57,250
want to try and flip that around okay

1391
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:59,950
I've got these descriptions of the type

1392
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:02,260
of information that we need to know how

1393
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:05,799
would I your green field deployment try

1394
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:06,850
to map those into x5 and I vocabulary so

1395
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,440
if we need to say something about the

1396
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:10,630
type of the thing we're shooting we're

1397
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,990
certifying in the certificate we can

1398
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:16,060
have x5 an extension that's a pretty

1399
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,540
common thing to have x5 an extension to

1400
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,299
say you know

1401
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:20,589
is the certificate for doing thing X as

1402
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:23,170
opposed to the certificate for doing

1403
01:08:20,589 --> 01:08:26,890
thing Y as opposed to you know a web

1404
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:28,180
certificate or a seed certificate and

1405
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:29,380
the crysta got the IP address we

1406
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,060
actually have a name type with IP

1407
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:33,640
address it fits very naturally in there

1408
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:35,819
I don't want to exclude doing something

1409
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:37,900
else but but that's the natural mapping

1410
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:39,370
running said to mean I didn't have a

1411
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:41,229
great place to put because I didn't

1412
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:43,568
really have a sense for what exactly was

1413
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:46,179
for it might be skippable we might have

1414
01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:47,859
to find someplace for it of course if

1415
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:51,970
we're using x5 on our extensions that's

1416
01:08:47,859 --> 01:08:55,049
sort of an extension point the every if

1417
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:57,010
we've not using the x5 ending name for

1418
01:08:55,049 --> 01:09:00,120
getting the domain information in the

1419
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:02,950
certificate and then the domain name I

1420
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,930
didn't have as great of a natural place

1421
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:07,689
to put that the best I could come up

1422
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:09,400
with was to say okay we've got x5 on an

1423
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:11,500
extension in a certificate that's gonna

1424
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:14,349
be like our type marker for this as a CP

1425
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:15,850
node certificate given that we already

1426
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:16,750
have that we can stuff a little bit more

1427
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:19,030
information in there

1428
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:20,680
the ACP domain name is kind of

1429
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:23,769
intrinsically tied to being an ACP

1430
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:25,810
certificate so just from the sort of

1431
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:29,740
information model mapping putting the

1432
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:32,440
ACP domain name in the x5 an extension

1433
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:34,689
that's our type marker feels fairly

1434
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:37,000
natural it's not a knock out of the park

1435
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:39,729
perfect fit but that would be my sort of

1436
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,850
sense of how to do it and I maybe give

1437
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:45,459
another point to think about it so the

1438
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:46,960
primary you know subject identification

1439
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:48,460
through the subject name kind of you

1440
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:51,399
know to me it always looks very similar

1441
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:55,030
to X 400 identifying some object through

1442
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:58,030
this you know tied value list of pairs

1443
01:09:55,030 --> 01:10:00,219
right and effectively you know an RFC

1444
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:01,809
822 address is very much the same thing

1445
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:05,380
and actually in the industry has won out

1446
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:06,910
over X 400 to name objects right so the

1447
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:09,490
fact that we're primarily naming people

1448
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:12,370
or so it's just because of the primary

1449
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:15,280
use cases right but in the way we're

1450
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:17,559
really just using the RFC a.22 address

1451
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,019
field here for several reasons that are

1452
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:22,780
listed in the document but it's very

1453
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,850
natural to use it to you know describe

1454
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:27,190
you know a preserved person in the

1455
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:30,469
context of the naming Authority which is

1456
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:33,619
the domain right in the same way as we

1457
01:10:30,469 --> 01:10:36,829
for people right that's why it's it's

1458
01:10:33,619 --> 01:10:38,539
natural from that perspective and the

1459
01:10:36,829 --> 01:10:40,308
whole idea of course was not to use the

1460
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:42,889
subject name because we wanted to reuse

1461
01:10:40,309 --> 01:10:45,380
a certificate so somebody else might

1462
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:47,210
have already some assignment the subject

1463
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:49,460
name needs to be something else so we

1464
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:52,249
wanted to sneak in so that we can

1465
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,469
basically extend the use of existing

1466
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:56,630
kind of that the certificates are used

1467
01:10:54,469 --> 01:10:59,239
for something and the entity right I

1468
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:00,860
sort of skipped over that part on one of

1469
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:02,629
the slides about the extension could be

1470
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,679
critical or not because I know we're

1471
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:05,599
using these certificates for other

1472
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,489
things than just ACP communication so we

1473
01:11:05,599 --> 01:11:08,719
presumably would not have a critical

1474
01:11:07,489 --> 01:11:10,159
extension in them because that would

1475
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:17,630
make it unusable for all of those other

1476
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:19,219
things and that was my last slide so the

1477
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:20,079
other thing that I want to ask everybody

1478
01:11:19,219 --> 01:11:22,400
here

1479
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:25,549
what was the point of mapping it to

1480
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:30,589
x.509 vocabulary well that's the idea in

1481
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:32,869
terms of if I just really can't get my

1482
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:35,570
head around thinking about this as an 82

1483
01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:38,749
name what would the other options be for

1484
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:41,210
winning of the we didn't do all these

1485
01:11:38,749 --> 01:11:43,309
other things and I argue for doing all

1486
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:44,929
this okay

1487
01:11:43,309 --> 01:11:48,229
the reason we didn't go that way or I

1488
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:53,570
didn't I was in the rough as it were was

1489
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:55,550
that we have operational experience that

1490
01:11:53,570 --> 01:12:00,380
we can't get CS to put anything in other

1491
01:11:55,550 --> 01:12:01,999
than a name and since they can verify

1492
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:03,920
the part on the right hand side of the

1493
01:12:01,999 --> 01:12:06,679
app and that's a domain name and they

1494
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,210
can verify the ownership of that and

1495
01:12:06,679 --> 01:12:11,420
they'll let us put anything that we like

1496
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:13,969
on the left hand part mostly because

1497
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:16,729
it's not their business that we at least

1498
01:12:13,969 --> 01:12:20,749
could get through that that part right

1499
01:12:16,729 --> 01:12:22,639
and and toilets also made sure that if

1500
01:12:20,749 --> 01:12:25,579
they really wanted to verify that part

1501
01:12:22,639 --> 01:12:28,039
by saying an email to it that we could

1502
01:12:25,579 --> 01:12:30,889
actually do that and create a mailbox to

1503
01:12:28,039 --> 01:12:32,119
create receive the email to validate the

1504
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:36,499
whole thing if we needed to do that

1505
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:38,900
right so so that we just we we just

1506
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:41,119
didn't want to fight the the CA

1507
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,808
infrastructure because it's hard enough

1508
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:43,639
already

1509
01:12:41,809 --> 01:12:44,809
this is like the the cab forum CA

1510
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:46,789
infrastructure

1511
01:12:44,809 --> 01:12:52,000
whether it's lab form or just the fact

1512
01:12:46,789 --> 01:12:56,360
that the the products out there that

1513
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,559
would implement CAS are set up for that

1514
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,230
kind of environment

1515
01:12:57,559 --> 01:13:02,570
right and that they are really reluctant

1516
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:04,610
to start certifying new exciting

1517
01:13:02,570 --> 01:13:07,429
extension types but they just don't know

1518
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:09,139
how they you just you just you you try

1519
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:12,380
to do it unless it's your own CA that

1520
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:14,780
you control enough detail on you wind up

1521
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:18,559
with you know well you just can't do

1522
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:22,250
that here right so that's that's where

1523
01:13:18,559 --> 01:13:24,469
it came from and I think it's I've

1524
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:27,710
written the code I think it's it's ugly

1525
01:13:24,469 --> 01:13:30,889
dogs breakfast right but you know what

1526
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:33,139
it doesn't done much and we we actually

1527
01:13:30,889 --> 01:13:34,969
have on the on the client and the new

1528
01:13:33,139 --> 01:13:36,500
device when we get address we have to

1529
01:13:34,969 --> 01:13:38,719
parse it out because we have to get our

1530
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:40,610
IP address out of it right to configure

1531
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,010
things so I'm like can I just have a

1532
01:13:40,610 --> 01:13:45,289
128-bit extension that just has my IP

1533
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:48,349
address in it right and the answer as

1534
01:13:45,289 --> 01:13:51,739
well yeah but how we're gonna get it in

1535
01:13:48,349 --> 01:13:57,969
right so easy in my code where I have a

1536
01:13:51,739 --> 01:14:01,360
local CA but I mean you can't get if as

1537
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:04,940
Owen is you know since using Acme

1538
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:06,679
literally let's encrypt for it it's just

1539
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:08,360
not going to happen right and that's the

1540
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:10,460
kind of space we really we did we just

1541
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:14,269
don't want that to be the blocking point

1542
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:15,980
for getting this deploy and I'm also

1543
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:17,599
looking from the operators experience

1544
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:20,178
right so all the crazy tooling you may

1545
01:14:17,599 --> 01:14:21,800
have whether it's you know OpenSSH or

1546
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:24,469
others right so I mean you always get

1547
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:26,300
the bloody RFC 822 address string in a

1548
01:14:24,469 --> 01:14:28,099
human readable form so you know

1549
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,079
fortunately there's a lot more known

1550
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:32,179
than autonomic Administration on the

1551
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:34,480
security side right I mean almost

1552
01:14:32,179 --> 01:14:37,010
nothing there you know from the Massa to

1553
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,468
the registrar all these things are non

1554
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:42,260
autonomic humans need to surveil that

1555
01:14:39,469 --> 01:14:44,360
and so basically the a20 to address is

1556
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:46,400
actually fairly easy to read for for

1557
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:48,789
humans right and we don't have to define

1558
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,138
it's a standard presentation make

1559
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:53,030
standard presentations which we

1560
01:14:51,139 --> 01:14:54,800
otherwise would need if all the same

1561
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:57,050
information fields would be in a binary

1562
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,190
encoding from it I also have to define a

1563
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:00,110
standard Hume

1564
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:02,059
presentation and then how do I get that

1565
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:04,009
standard human presentation to a lot of

1566
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:05,900
tooling that exists right now it's sort

1567
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:08,630
of dovetailing naturally into the other

1568
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:10,580
question I sort of had which is you know

1569
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:12,800
yes I've heard that we need the human

1570
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:15,260
readable version of this and you're just

1571
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,560
saying right now about how that comes in

1572
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:22,250
throughout several stages the process

1573
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:24,860
which is good for me to think about and

1574
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:27,290
I just sort of final question about is

1575
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:31,969
in terms of when we have the human

1576
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:34,160
readable part do we need all of the

1577
01:15:31,969 --> 01:15:36,440
information that's there do we just need

1578
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:39,530
the IP address we need the domain name

1579
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,179
as well our sub as most of it I think

1580
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:42,620
the domain name so for example if you're

1581
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:45,469
really saying oh I want to create

1582
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:46,550
different domains within my security

1583
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:48,530
context right you're a single

1584
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:50,120
organization you want to have networks

1585
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:51,860
that shouldn't talk to each other so

1586
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,570
their domain names need to be different

1587
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,549
so that's something that you would

1588
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:56,989
immediately have in any type of neighbor

1589
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:59,120
ship forming yeah you're definitely in

1590
01:15:56,989 --> 01:16:00,949
the ACP domains that fails not because

1591
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:03,949
the keys are incompatible but the domain

1592
01:16:00,949 --> 01:16:05,900
name so the reason why you know you

1593
01:16:03,949 --> 01:16:07,339
couldn't attach these devices would be

1594
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:08,929
immediately seeing all the domain name

1595
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:10,340
strings are different right so all the

1596
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:13,610
pieces I think are important to see

1597
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:15,380
actually the question of what would we

1598
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:17,690
likely see in extensions I said we don't

1599
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:19,760
have an idea but that's not true I just

1600
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:22,549
didn't remember so for example the one

1601
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,530
next logical thing is key roles right so

1602
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:26,449
we've been talking about we have the

1603
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:29,509
role of the registrar where we've been

1604
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:31,460
starting to put one existing flag in

1605
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:33,380
there already right but there might be

1606
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:35,540
other important roles like for the NOC

1607
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:37,580
to be able to push down policy into

1608
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:40,640
other devices or things but we still

1609
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:42,680
don't are far away from complete mutual

1610
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,350
autonomic anybody can do something at

1611
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:46,850
the same level of authority and and

1612
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,560
those are all things I think are going

1613
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:50,410
to be important extensions that certain

1614
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,580
devices are going to be given

1615
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:54,050
certificates with the specific role that

1616
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:55,699
would be an example okay

1617
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:57,469
excellent well I know we're pretty sure

1618
01:16:55,699 --> 01:16:59,960
on time so I don't want to take it more

1619
01:16:57,469 --> 01:17:01,969
thank you for giving me a lot more

1620
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:04,430
insight into what actually the the needs

1621
01:17:01,969 --> 01:17:05,540
are here I will go back and then ponder

1622
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:08,949
over it some more and hopefully we can

1623
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,949
make some good progress so thank you

1624
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:21,110
you have three minutes can you go to the

1625
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:21,110
Mikey

1626
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:27,690
what about whiskey a Stephan freeze and

1627
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:32,210
I'm just asking because he opens a slide

1628
01:17:27,690 --> 01:17:32,210
before but then he looks on reordering

1629
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:50,580
give us your fastest speed so I would

1630
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:53,519
like to just give a short status update

1631
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:55,650
on the Brisky AE draft so the draft

1632
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,390
basically originates from the fact that

1633
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:59,400
there are certain industry scenarios

1634
01:17:57,390 --> 01:18:02,610
where we can't apply whisky as is

1635
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:04,830
because there is limited functionality

1636
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:07,349
or limited connectivity to back-end

1637
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:10,530
services like PKI services or the PGI

1638
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:15,540
services like the ra or CA are more than

1639
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:17,790
one hop away so the changes from the

1640
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:20,700
last meeting as basically some updates

1641
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:23,070
of the introduction text that relate to

1642
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,660
the usage of ID f ID and rfid so it

1643
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:27,360
basically explains the self contained

1644
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:29,760
object that is being used here or that

1645
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:33,240
is being argumented and it explains that

1646
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,830
a nun protocol agnostic way i also

1647
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,630
updated the description of some

1648
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:38,760
architectural elements and changes in

1649
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:40,620
the Brisky architecture so it's just an

1650
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,960
enhancement to section 5 which was

1651
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:45,030
already there so the biggest change of

1652
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,570
the biggest enhancement of the draft is

1653
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:50,550
actually the introduction of an

1654
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:54,150
addressing scheme when more than one

1655
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:55,830
enrollment for the course being used so

1656
01:18:54,150 --> 01:19:00,240
I have a slide on that one as well

1657
01:18:55,830 --> 01:19:01,800
and the consideration of existing

1658
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,120
enrollment protocols has been enhanced

1659
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:06,660
so last time there was a discussion

1660
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:08,849
about that we have currently est with

1661
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:11,460
full CMC requests included in the draft

1662
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:13,650
and there is also a reference to CMP

1663
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:16,260
mean why we are not referencing CMP

1664
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:17,940
directly we're using CMP the lightweight

1665
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:20,380
profile of CMP which is currently being

1666
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:23,889
discussed on the lands working group

1667
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:26,090
so just to recall what is meant by

1668
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:27,890
authenticated self-contained objects

1669
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:30,350
what we need for a synchronous

1670
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:32,120
enrollment is to have a binding of the

1671
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:34,760
proof of procession which we get into

1672
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:37,160
the pkcs 10 request and then we need a

1673
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,590
binding of the proof of identity that is

1674
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:42,769
being done in Brisky using the direct

1675
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:44,660
binding to TLS if we have multiple TLS

1676
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:47,930
hops to the RA or if we have a

1677
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:49,550
terminated connection and no connection

1678
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:52,430
to backward services or back-end

1679
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:54,680
services then we need something else

1680
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:58,160
Brisky AE is basically motivating that

1681
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:00,890
was having a rep pkcs 10 can be done

1682
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:03,080
with a CMS for instance so what we also

1683
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:06,440
need is a certificate waiting indication

1684
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:10,219
that is what Elliot likes to reference

1685
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:12,650
as come back later for the soup that has

1686
01:20:10,219 --> 01:20:15,680
been included in the last iteration of

1687
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:19,879
the draft already so I skipped that

1688
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:21,890
slide so what I said at the beginning we

1689
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:25,100
have more than one enrollment protocol

1690
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:29,060
so unfortunately we have that so we have

1691
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:31,219
est-ce npc MC s-- kept within the ACE

1692
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:33,680
working group there is a new est

1693
01:20:31,219 --> 01:20:35,060
wrapping being defined which actually

1694
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:37,219
ends up in something like a

1695
01:20:35,060 --> 01:20:43,670
self-contained object so what we

1696
01:20:37,219 --> 01:20:45,739
included here is a proposal for for how

1697
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:49,250
to address the different enrollment

1698
01:20:45,739 --> 01:20:51,110
schemes here and we utilized what's

1699
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:55,219
already being defined in risky so Brisky

1700
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:59,839
uses the well-known notation from our c

1701
01:20:55,219 --> 01:21:01,489
5 6 8 5 and we enhance that with what is

1702
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,050
shown here on the slide was enrollment

1703
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:05,900
protocol and request and enrollment

1704
01:21:03,050 --> 01:21:08,060
protocol can be exchanged with est which

1705
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,230
is natively used and brewski but it

1706
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,540
could also be some of the other

1707
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:13,339
protocols that are stated there and the

1708
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:15,080
request will basically be something like

1709
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:18,260
simple enroll that has been used in

1710
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:20,059
risky or full CMC requests which would

1711
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:23,409
be used in risky AE for the safe

1712
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:27,070
contained object so open issue

1713
01:21:23,409 --> 01:21:28,869
that we see risky itself regarding the

1714
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:33,009
naming scheme or that addressing scheme

1715
01:21:28,869 --> 01:21:34,630
risky uses est over HTTPS if we also

1716
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:37,780
take into account what's happening in

1717
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:40,179
the ACE working group with co-op est we

1718
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:43,900
may enhance the naming scheme to also

1719
01:21:40,179 --> 01:21:47,469
support co-op s instead of HTTPS there

1720
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:49,089
so what's what's being necessary is a

1721
01:21:47,469 --> 01:21:51,340
selection of a set of mandatory

1722
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:53,530
enrollment protocols to increase

1723
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:55,209
interoperability but keeping the option

1724
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:57,449
to also select other and loan and

1725
01:21:55,209 --> 01:21:59,590
protocols that brought us to the

1726
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:01,478
introduction at least partly

1727
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:03,429
introduction of some kind of discovery

1728
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:06,459
mechanism which is auktioner the

1729
01:22:03,429 --> 01:22:07,989
discovery mechanism could use the naming

1730
01:22:06,459 --> 01:22:10,169
scheme for the different enrollment for

1731
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:12,879
the code so a pledge could easily be

1732
01:22:10,169 --> 01:22:17,229
discover which enrollment other codes

1733
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:17,650
are supported by the registrar so next

1734
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:19,689
steps

1735
01:22:17,650 --> 01:22:23,530
yeah further refinement of the approach

1736
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:24,789
then we have some some error discussion

1737
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:27,669
between the authors regarding the

1738
01:22:24,789 --> 01:22:30,188
operational modes so right now risky and

1739
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:33,340
Brisky ie oppose targeting some kind of

1740
01:22:30,189 --> 01:22:35,439
recoded I call it pool behavior so the

1741
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:37,510
pledge is always acting as as a client

1742
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:39,099
but there are certain scenarios where

1743
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:42,090
the pledge is also acting as a server

1744
01:22:39,099 --> 01:22:45,280
which what I refer to as push scenario

1745
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:48,579
and we are currently discussing about

1746
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:50,320
how to integrate this push behavior into

1747
01:22:48,579 --> 01:22:51,728
the draft by keeping all the different

1748
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,579
architecture elements which are already

1749
01:22:51,729 --> 01:22:56,349
there in Brisky so to not change too

1750
01:22:54,579 --> 01:22:59,409
much of the architecture but being able

1751
01:22:56,349 --> 01:23:02,709
to to let the pledge work as a server

1752
01:22:59,409 --> 01:23:04,598
and well that is actually the reason

1753
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:08,019
that I think right now it's not the

1754
01:23:04,599 --> 01:23:09,789
right time to ask for reduction we have

1755
01:23:08,019 --> 01:23:12,789
asked for adoption last time but then

1756
01:23:09,789 --> 01:23:14,650
this new feature came into into the

1757
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:16,989
picture and we thought it's better to

1758
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:19,650
not ask for adoption so it's just an

1759
01:23:16,989 --> 01:23:22,169
update that I would like to give you

1760
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:26,768
would but it'd still be you know a

1761
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:29,110
separate small you know HTTP like like a

1762
01:23:26,769 --> 01:23:31,449
separate one which I mean brewski right

1763
01:23:29,110 --> 01:23:33,249
now is kind of EST plus plus so the

1764
01:23:31,449 --> 01:23:37,650
limited context or even in a more

1765
01:23:33,249 --> 01:23:40,380
broader context like let's say in a

1766
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:43,259
net confessed connection at which which

1767
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:51,570
maybe embroider it could probably also

1768
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:54,360
be a broader approach what I mean they

1769
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:56,009
they obviously have some opinions of

1770
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:58,080
their own in terms of already having a

1771
01:23:56,010 --> 01:23:59,910
bunch of components like you know

1772
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,530
certificate enrollment that would

1773
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:03,360
replace her 70/30

1774
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:06,750
but obviously nothing that would replace

1775
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:10,410
the brewski elements right so that seems

1776
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:12,210
like you know a fairly big difference in

1777
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:14,280
how they do encoding models or so but

1778
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:17,640
maybe the the brewski steps would be

1779
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:19,860
logical to bring into that context right

1780
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,240
so what we had in mind here are two

1781
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,670
different modes actually for push

1782
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:26,429
oneness just push the pledge to start

1783
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:28,020
with risky and that could be if the

1784
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:29,940
network is discovering that there is a

1785
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,830
new device in the network instead of the

1786
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:34,410
the device is discovering that it's

1787
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:36,780
happened to be in a new network and the

1788
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:38,400
other thing would be to reverse the

1789
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:49,740
roads that the pledge is really the

1790
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:53,240
server finish our intentions with more

1791
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:53,240
ad stream needs over time

1792
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:03,510
sorry just who has read the document the

1793
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:07,700
latest one this was AAA

1794
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:07,700
okay all right

1795
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:21,679
okay Michael yeah okay do it yeah sure

1796
01:25:23,059 --> 01:25:30,479
we need two minutes to wrap up just talk

1797
01:25:27,019 --> 01:25:34,139
so I started a document which I did not

1798
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:38,760
post for riot of personal emergency

1799
01:25:34,139 --> 01:25:44,760
reasons and call it a delegated voucher

1800
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:52,229
and we use vouchers in a bunch of

1801
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:54,659
different places and right here so and

1802
01:25:52,229 --> 01:25:57,320
it has some problems okay it must be

1803
01:25:54,659 --> 01:25:59,638
online doesn't support second sale

1804
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:03,688
manufacture goes with business you might

1805
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:06,449
have to throw out the device and SSDP

1806
01:26:03,689 --> 01:26:08,369
which is the net comp version works

1807
01:26:06,449 --> 01:26:10,228
better for a number of online uses but

1808
01:26:08,369 --> 01:26:12,509
it still is quite almost of the same

1809
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:14,789
difficulties if you know but the guy

1810
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:16,530
goes offline or what unavailable then

1811
01:26:14,789 --> 01:26:21,148
you things don't work and you can't sell

1812
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:23,188
resell it necessarily so problem trying

1813
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:25,919
to solve is is second cell from a

1814
01:26:23,189 --> 01:26:27,749
willing seller so someone who you know

1815
01:26:25,919 --> 01:26:31,050
actually could do something perhaps

1816
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:32,579
before they put the device take the

1817
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:34,589
device off their network and put it in a

1818
01:26:32,579 --> 01:26:37,228
box and ship it to you

1819
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:39,599
second sell via creditor bankruptcy etc

1820
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:41,939
which means that in fact means that the

1821
01:26:39,599 --> 01:26:43,979
and the enterprise that has the

1822
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:45,719
equipment essentially is non-functional

1823
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:48,030
doesn't exists and you couldn't you

1824
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:51,809
can't really get anywhere with it so the

1825
01:26:48,030 --> 01:26:54,179
second problem manufacturer of assembly

1826
01:26:51,809 --> 01:26:55,919
or composite devices the examples been

1827
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:57,209
given as a passenger rail car that might

1828
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:59,780
have a whole bunch of interesting

1829
01:26:57,209 --> 01:27:02,099
sensors on them which will be not

1830
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:03,239
proxied so they'll actually all be on

1831
01:27:02,099 --> 01:27:06,809
the network and they all need to be on

1832
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:08,459
boarded but the the assembly needs to be

1833
01:27:06,809 --> 01:27:10,859
on boarded together and they don't want

1834
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:14,599
the devices that are you assemble with

1835
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:17,399
to each be having vouchers from their

1836
01:27:14,599 --> 01:27:21,239
their manufacturers you want some other

1837
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:22,350
process and the same same situations

1838
01:27:21,239 --> 01:27:24,740
been sent for

1839
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:26,940
Factory kind of environments

1840
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,290
disconnected owner that's the classic

1841
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:36,349
noir we've had the military based

1842
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:39,060
example with light bulbs and the example

1843
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:43,020
both Owen and I thought Stefan had to

1844
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:45,570
wanted to be able to pin a cloud PKI

1845
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,090
registrar and have things change so that

1846
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:50,269
was kind of what I was trying to solve

1847
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:55,890
basic shape of what I'm proposing is

1848
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:57,840
that you have some kind of array of

1849
01:27:55,890 --> 01:28:00,780
serial numbers which you are going to

1850
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:03,330
write a voucher for and that you pin an

1851
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:05,730
intermediate intermediary who can then

1852
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:08,700
issue another certificate which is more

1853
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:11,070
specific and then you might have a have

1854
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:13,349
a limit to how many of these chains of

1855
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:14,759
certificates that you could have okay

1856
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:17,490
that's the general shape of what it

1857
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:19,200
would look like so imagine this is the

1858
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:21,570
the first case you had a delegated

1859
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:23,880
voucher this dv1 to have owner number

1860
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:27,179
one owner number one effectively can now

1861
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:30,810
run a Massa and can delegate to owner

1862
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:32,670
number two okay and the pledge has to

1863
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:34,920
evaluate the whole set so you have to

1864
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:36,900
send the dv1 voucher along with the

1865
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,780
ephemeral voucher so that the pledge can

1866
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:42,389
see oh I can go from the original Massa

1867
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:44,130
to the first owner and then to the

1868
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:48,180
second owner right so you have this

1869
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:51,090
chain of rare thing and here's another

1870
01:28:48,180 --> 01:28:52,860
example with a third thing how many

1871
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:54,300
layers and this chain do you want to

1872
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,000
have well that's an interesting question

1873
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,260
whether you want to have a limit or not

1874
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,390
one of the things that you can do with

1875
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:03,270
this is owner one could be the same guy

1876
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:06,360
as owner - but owner two is when he has

1877
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:08,190
a new see a right so the last thing he

1878
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:12,269
does before he gets a new changes hit

1879
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:17,219
from godaddy to thottie right is issue

1880
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:19,110
himself as a delegated voucher for his

1881
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:21,090
new name right which lets them basically

1882
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:22,230
continue operating that's really yet

1883
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:24,450
okay

1884
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:26,759
and in intermediary that's conversations

1885
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:28,470
with some companies that do essentially

1886
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,020
they collect equipment from bankrupt

1887
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:32,220
companies and resell them I met these

1888
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,080
companies because they're good places to

1889
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,149
buy really good equipment from you know

1890
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:39,749
rock-bottom prices right

1891
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:41,249
and the the issue is that well they

1892
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:44,429
don't have anything right what are they

1893
01:29:41,249 --> 01:29:47,639
gonna do how am I going to get ownership

1894
01:29:44,429 --> 01:29:49,320
of things and so they may be able to

1895
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:51,989
negotiate with the manufacturers better

1896
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:55,459
than I can and in particular if they do

1897
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:58,499
it right then the they may be able to

1898
01:29:55,459 --> 01:30:00,300
essentially go in and put their own

1899
01:29:58,499 --> 01:30:02,760
trust anchors into the equipment and

1900
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:06,329
have the expertise to do that whereas I

1901
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:08,639
either won't or many I won't have the

1902
01:30:06,329 --> 01:30:10,379
right chance to do that so they could

1903
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,849
resell things and do that and there's a

1904
01:30:10,379 --> 01:30:14,309
bunch of cases where people said an

1905
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:15,629
intermediary would would help add a

1906
01:30:14,309 --> 01:30:17,159
layer of indirection it's always the

1907
01:30:15,629 --> 01:30:25,769
problem the solution in computer science

1908
01:30:17,159 --> 01:30:28,289
right that's it time for any discussion

1909
01:30:25,769 --> 01:30:31,849
and that's the end of this anniversary

1910
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:34,879
she said so and you go home and

1911
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:39,649
hopefully see you in Vancouver next

1912
01:30:34,879 --> 01:30:39,649
match right thank you

1913
01:30:56,339 --> 01:31:26,568
yes right when you have a minute just

1914
01:33:52,040 --> 01:34:02,420
yeah that's me to ignore and since

1915
01:34:02,879 --> 01:34:11,608
so we could know it because there was

1916
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:13,199
nobody really your son she just

1917
01:34:11,609 --> 01:34:16,189
announced the meeting but everybody is

1918
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:16,188
then pointing to their

1919
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,780
you
