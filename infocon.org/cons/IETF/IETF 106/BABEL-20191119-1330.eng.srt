1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:13,750
which is really not meeting girls

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:32,989
well this this one would be good the

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:48,710
slides do this to go something else

4
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:51,319
first into the white wine our let's go

5
00:00:48,710 --> 00:01:01,640
back to the this will only go back to

6
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:05,180
the agenda right okay so you think what

7
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:11,780
I should do that such that so I need you

8
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:21,860
over to me my ashes to the tryout

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:25,100
machine it's much easier sure no the

10
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,400
first one is the first one here in the

11
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,399
right order

12
00:01:49,670 --> 00:02:00,090
they're all PDFs actually that's another

13
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,649
advantage of doing it for my machine is

14
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,649
if I do powerpoints I can edit them

15
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:13,079
[Music]

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,610
usually I get started earlier and I have

17
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,610
actually done this before

18
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:32,950
what this is Monday plus is the Tuesday

19
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:34,990
13:30 go ahead sorry okay okay so we

20
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,730
don't actually have too much to do and I

21
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:43,570
got early so I guess I'll go ahead

22
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:46,690
really rapidly here it's not Donald

23
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,900
Eastlake with future way Russ White was

24
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,020
unable to make this meeting Martin art

25
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:59,080
area director is sitting in front here

26
00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:03,160
so this okay people are presumably aware

27
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,740
of the note well and the fact that you

28
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,150
want quality documents you should review

29
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,420
other documents and if you do that

30
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,830
people probably review your documents so

31
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,559
here's the proposed agenda so just do

32
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,420
some update on status just briefly

33
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,670
touched on the yang model document so

34
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,799
that block meant that graft the yang

35
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,560
model Lachman is in last call ending at

36
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,239
this meeting so we'll see what there

37
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,560
haven't been any negative comments there

38
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:32,380
have been some positive comments on the

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:36,070
list here in Mabel presentation by Sandy

40
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:39,000
Jiang and I just have a presentation on

41
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:43,840
possible DVF maybe they will futures

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,160
which I can go over well what seems like

43
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
things we might want to work on in the

44
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,650
future

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,740
mostly for discussion on the mailing

46
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,289
list and showing anybody has discussion

47
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,060
here or ideas here we can do that does

48
00:04:53,290 --> 00:05:03,970
anybody want any changes in this agenda

49
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:06,190
additions deletions whatever okay so we

50
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,860
have two documents that have been food

51
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:13,360
with the iesg inner all green in the

52
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,770
Ballad so they're two documents which

53
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,290
have discusses though need to be

54
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,830
resolved

55
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:22,070
the H max security document and the new

56
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,719
base protocol document there's two

57
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,900
documents with publication requested

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,790
source specific information model as I

59
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,010
said that will yang models in working

60
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:34,610
group last call there is also a working

61
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:36,740
group draft on the round-trip time

62
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,010
extension which was presented at the

63
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,010
last etf meeting and there's a couple of

64
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,420
related drafts which is the home that

65
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:51,800
draft which is waiting on the protocol

66
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:54,920
draft and Sandy's draft on beer papal

67
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,970
extensions so we've really done pretty

68
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,190
well on the milestones that are in the

69
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:01,310
Charter really the only one left is to

70
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,540
submit the yang document to the iesg

71
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,530
which perhaps we can do later today

72
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,540
which at that point there would be all

73
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,130
the milestones in the current milestone

74
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:17,080
listen the Charter would be completed

75
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:23,870
which seems good so that's it for these

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:28,310
agenda and status slides so I guess on

77
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:30,410
the yang model draft the only question I

78
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,660
really had was it currently there's an

79
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,390
orangey yang symbol which means that the

80
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,150
automated yang checker isn't completely

81
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,500
happy with it is that a problem or can

82
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,909
they I mean because there's certainly

83
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:46,250
most people think it's an excellent

84
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:48,020
condition and we could just go ahead or

85
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,180
you can come up front if you want to

86
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,200
over there whichever way you're closer

87
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:56,500
to that microphone so I guess what

88
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,240
you're referring to is on data tracker

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,740
yeah saying that yeah well there are

90
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,150
some issues with the tools themselves

91
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:12,140
that sometimes lead to that error and

92
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:14,450
it's good is as as simple as saying that

93
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,490
one of the included files that I might

94
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,140
have referred to is something it can't

95
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,640
find

96
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,950
I can suddenly take a look at it and

97
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,479
send a note to the mailing list if need

98
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:27,440
be to let have even know maybe I see

99
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:53,390
Martinez pull up

100
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:57,980
oh okay so I believe that that is a bug

101
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,900
in the tool the a feature requirement

102
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,330
for it to be mechanical order although

103
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,729
the a B and F grammar for the language

104
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,010
says that that is the right order for

105
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,750
some reason it's complaining but anyway

106
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,250
as I said I'll take a look at it and

107
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:16,160
send a note to the mailing list

108
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:17,950
okay confirming and now if you're gonna

109
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,690
send a note you'll be like later today

110
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,150
okay yeah more than happy to actually do

111
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:26,090
it and so is there any objection after

112
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:28,060
that notice posted to declaring the

113
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,530
draft to a past working group last fall

114
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,630
it's been I have noticed out for a while

115
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,630
like I say this with no objections and

116
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,419
some support so hearing nothing as soon

117
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,159
as you post that note or unless you say

118
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,960
you don't want to I need to head in that

119
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,000
note then I'll post a message saying

120
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,220
it's fast working group last call and I

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,540
can start working on the publication

122
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:55,360
request - okay sounds okay information

123
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,550
model has been publication requested

124
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,890
there is a template out there and it's

125
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:05,959
currently requested as well in that

126
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:11,689
state in the state of publication

127
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:19,550
requested okay here for a bedroll you I

128
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:33,770
know that see how do I get to so I guess

129
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:36,349
I want to go here okay okay good

130
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:39,949
afternoon I'm Sam is on from that he

131
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,880
this print is for PR in Babel we have

132
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:46,340
caused or

133
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:50,210
Tony P and it's I'm glad to present this

134
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:52,700
job Hokkien Babel working group so at

135
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:58,490
first let us see the motivation of this

136
00:09:52,700 --> 00:10:01,430
draft we our intent is to use paper

137
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:05,870
protocol Esbjerg underlay protocol to

138
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:09,739
build a beer forwarding there let's let

139
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:13,460
me introduce peer technology here and

140
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:17,560
briefly you know that beer is a new

141
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:20,690
multicast a technology and it can you

142
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,160
can build multicast forwarding there

143
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:27,050
without it is explicitly multicast

144
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,110
distributing trees building and it

145
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,589
doesn't require any inter mediate in

146
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:36,020
those to maintain any per flow stage so

147
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:38,720
it's a new multi has the technology and

148
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:43,010
the other can bring many advantage of

149
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,950
what it has the forwarding hmm and the

150
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:49,580
beer is split the networking into three

151
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:52,670
parts and the first one is a core layer

152
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:55,760
it me is called peer forwarding layer

153
00:10:52,670 --> 00:11:00,520
and needing this forwarding there the

154
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:04,460
vector can be forward by multicast

155
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:09,310
duplicate and it can reach around her

156
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:13,790
without the SG or much much e in the

157
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:17,560
intermediary network and the packet can

158
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:21,110
be encapsulated with her header

159
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,920
now mr. processor I'm curious function

160
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:28,250
Ethernet function and a v6 function is

161
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,010
ongoing but in order to build as a

162
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,590
beautiful loading there we must rely on

163
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:37,400
some under a protocol to build

164
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:39,860
forwarding so we depends on the ITP

165
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,010
protocol and the beach P protocol and

166
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,000
the variable to to build a the routing

167
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:50,120
under day so we use the exchanging of

168
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,520
this routing protocol like a Bible like

169
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:57,680
her ITP to forward

170
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,250
querida we are information and spread it

171
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:04,900
into the networks and all the computer

172
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:08,030
knows in the network can calculated

173
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:11,510
unicast routing and the can also

174
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:14,000
calculate as a beer forwarding table so

175
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:16,100
as a beautiful wedding

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,490
layer can be built from the IDP

177
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:25,210
extension and after the forwarding layer

178
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:29,660
is built and the overlay is used to

179
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:32,540
corrected the podcast information about

180
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,270
the numerous router and the egress wrote

181
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,949
our search for some specific multicast

182
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:45,410
the flow so the be the universe rotor

183
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:48,500
like this BF IR can run wanna be PFI all

184
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:52,060
receive some specific multicast flow it

185
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:55,070
can encapsulate the packet with

186
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:59,949
according to a pair header and the

187
00:12:55,070 --> 00:13:03,380
forwarded into the network then the the

188
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:06,260
intermediator notes came forward this

189
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,170
package and the duplicated this factor

190
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,550
according to the previous calculation

191
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:16,069
result and push this packet to the edge

192
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:20,060
routers so the parameter can be

193
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:24,880
forwarded in this network and using be

194
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:28,339
peer multicast the technology so in some

195
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,970
network we know that we may only use

196
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:35,210
bebo is routing protocol so every day

197
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:38,170
like a fool mmm the bro I appear in

198
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:42,140
these networks we can't depends on SPF

199
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:44,810
extension ice I say extension or PD

200
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:48,830
extension we can only rely on Bebo

201
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:52,040
extension so we'd like to make some

202
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:54,580
extensions in Babel protocol to build as

203
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:58,630
a beer forwarding layer so it's our

204
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:03,130
motivation so

205
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:06,460
so briefly summary of protocol we know

206
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:09,250
that bebo is distance vector routing

207
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:13,810
protocol it can be used the young world

208
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:16,810
and the worldís mass networks so it's a

209
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:20,829
very good routing protocol can be used

210
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:24,030
in well various network it's our intent

211
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:28,870
because it can extend the beer

212
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:33,160
deployment in the wireless network and

213
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:35,800
we know that people has made some heavy

214
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,760
extension to carry the indigenous

215
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:43,930
additional information so we think that

216
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:48,640
people can also use a new sub T of V

217
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:52,900
took away the beer information - so we

218
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,790
with racket will use peer extension to

219
00:14:52,900 --> 00:15:02,260
carry the beer parameter in the network

220
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:06,280
so it's an example of implementation we

221
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,890
know that suppose that the node a is a

222
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:13,180
universe brought her officer network and

223
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:17,560
there's other routers cow also wrong the

224
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:21,099
Babel protocol and when people protocol

225
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:25,180
is used to advertise the prefix of every

226
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,530
node The Associated appear information

227
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,479
such as sub domain and the bf ID and

228
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:35,740
some other information can also be

229
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:39,190
carried with the prefix advertisement so

230
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:43,180
one Babel protocol is running the

231
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:45,550
network and as long as the prefix

232
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:48,969
information has spread in the network

233
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:53,050
peer information can also be spreading

234
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:56,860
this network so one pebble protocol

235
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:59,380
calculated the unique hostile route it

236
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:03,010
can also calculate as a peer forwarding

237
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:08,220
haber so peer forwarding layer can be

238
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:11,930
built from this MRB is an example of

239
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:15,410
peer or a protocol so in this net

240
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:18,680
we suppose that the MRD is used to

241
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:22,730
convey the AG rotors information for

242
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:26,390
some specific her multicast flow so the

243
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:32,530
for example know the a hanging capsulate

244
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:36,410
the associated Heather into the in the

245
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:39,260
the motive has to flow packet and then

246
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,569
forward adding the network and all the

247
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,170
net the noting this networker come

248
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:50,210
forward the packet correctly according

249
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:54,469
to the pier forwarding table and we know

250
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:57,460
that because the pier capability in this

251
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,850
network may be an optional so we you

252
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:03,470
define some an entire Beach of the

253
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:06,950
extended sub jovi to zero

254
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:10,100
if a router cannot recognize the sake of

255
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:13,490
e it can it must even know the unknown

256
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:20,060
sub shell V and it cannot processing the

257
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:23,450
other key fields in this extension it's

258
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:26,899
for matter of a post-secondary and that

259
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:32,150
we the second only profits is aligned

260
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:35,380
with the definition in SPF and ice is so

261
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:39,440
we also defined at the same fields in

262
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,160
the extension but we may not use it in

263
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,910
be able to because the such as PA are

264
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:51,260
bar and the IP ie views may not have

265
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:53,920
special meaning in paper protocol so we

266
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:57,170
just define and the to align with

267
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:01,910
advertisement with IP protocol but it

268
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:04,130
may be may not be used for now but maybe

269
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,930
in some footer we can find some use of

270
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:11,450
this field and also as we defined a sub

271
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:15,850
sub activity of MPs encapsulation

272
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:18,440
it's also keep our line with

273
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:21,379
advertisement thinking OSPF and the eyes

274
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,300
eyes and in the future we will add the

275
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,429
literal netting encapsulation sub sub at

276
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:29,019
your V is

277
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:31,389
has only different from the type fields

278
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:37,720
with employers encapsulation sub sub

279
00:18:31,389 --> 00:18:41,529
govt so it's some information about the

280
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,409
under de ABR underlay extension and the

281
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:49,299
science support for beer has been

282
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:51,789
published this fc8 for the other one and

283
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:55,210
also the OSPF extension has been

284
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:59,220
published and the PTP extension is

285
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:03,399
ongoing and the but we know that and

286
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:06,399
beer does not rely on all wrote her sing

287
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:08,918
our domain to firm performing the beer

288
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:12,518
forwarding so how to support tunnels

289
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,889
that will allows to tunnel beer across

290
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,480
such rotors which cannot support a beer

291
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:19,479
forwarding in Babel

292
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,720
is for further study because we know

293
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:26,110
that there is a distance vector protocol

294
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,330
and the not our SPF protocol so when it

295
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:31,508
calculates the roads and routes

296
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:36,460
maybe we know that because it's only one

297
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:39,820
hop away so it may define some tunnels

298
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:43,450
or we use special method to build a

299
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:47,470
tunnel to across the router which cannot

300
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,749
support a beer for body and there is an

301
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,259
implementation of the control plane of

302
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:57,159
beer in Babel you can maybe you can find

303
00:19:53,259 --> 00:20:02,369
a some something where you being this

304
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:05,110
link ok that's all for today thank you

305
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:09,749
ok thank you

306
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,748
do we have comments or questions on this

307
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:32,019
I guess after we go on Donald it's a

308
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:34,389
question for you sure if the working

309
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:37,299
hope was to work on that would that be

310
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:39,029
part of a chartering effort or do you

311
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:40,950
think it fits in the

312
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,659
it does fit in the Charter because there

313
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,279
it's it's an optional thing in the

314
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,080
Charter the Carter just certain things

315
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,900
have to be done and gives to optional

316
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,189
things which I actually go over that in

317
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,679
my I mentioned that in my presentation

318
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,860
there's multicast and source-specific

319
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,140
routing okay so we've already done sort

320
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,219
of specific routing but pretty much with

321
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:05,960
them okay thank you

322
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:22,980
sure any other questions or comments

323
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:24,779
okay thank you thank you yeah anybody

324
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,159
else hasn't signed the blue sheets stick

325
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:31,500
your hand up or something we can get

326
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:36,899
them to you so I have a little

327
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:40,950
presentation on possible futures so you

328
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:43,110
know starts by going over what the work

329
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,179
items are in our Charter and their

330
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,289
status so Green is basically a good

331
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:51,299
color indicates we've there so the

332
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:53,100
stability segment is explicitly called

333
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:58,559
out in the Charter and that's that's the

334
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:01,379
iesg there's the proposed standard

335
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,299
Nevada based protocol standard there's a

336
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,710
security needs need to be addressed and

337
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:07,080
we have two drafts that do that one of

338
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,960
which is it's fully approved and one of

339
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,809
which has a one discuss left needs to be

340
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,270
resolved manageability is listed there

341
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:17,039
and we have the information model which

342
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:19,470
is in publication requested and we have

343
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:23,850
the angle which if we later today will

344
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:26,490
be in the past working group last call

345
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,918
and this when I get the paperwork and

346
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:34,789
stuff done will convene publication

347
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:37,500
requested the Charter says we should

348
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,149
document implementation experience but

349
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,919
it explicitly says it doesn't need to be

350
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:43,020
an RFC or a document or something like

351
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,240
that so we've basically been doing that

352
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,850
by doing reports at meetings there is

353
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,620
not such a report at this meeting but at

354
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:52,060
last meeting there was a report on the

355
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,459
implementation

356
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:58,360
so we've sort of been doing that by my

357
00:22:54,460 --> 00:23:01,480
reports to the meetings pretty much

358
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:03,250
meets that item there are two optional

359
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,560
things in the existing Charter One with

360
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,360
sort specific routing and there's a

361
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,250
graph on that which is in publication

362
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,149
requested state and the other is

363
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,360
multicast

364
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,760
so we haven't made nearly that progress

365
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,389
on multicast I think it's more

366
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:23,080
complicated topic but we do have this

367
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:26,230
beer available extensions draft and it's

368
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,330
something which we can our charted to

369
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,440
work on with our current Charter is an

370
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:34,389
optional item so I came up with a couple

371
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,830
of other things the list as possible

372
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:40,960
work items one would be type of service

373
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:42,429
specific routing so you have different

374
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,740
routing for different types of service

375
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,890
there is an expired graft on that topic

376
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,810
for our working group which hasn't been

377
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,510
worked on in a while but that that could

378
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:54,070
be revived and I think it's mara way so

379
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,980
straight forward another possibility I

380
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:59,500
thought of is doing an 802 11 mesh it's

381
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,900
a Wi-Fi mesh pass selection protocol so

382
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,010
Wi-Fi mesh assumes of course all the

383
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:08,050
nodes and your Wi-Fi mesh have the same

384
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,879
path selection protocol routing protocol

385
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,970
II it's coming to call it a past

386
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,260
election protocol and their provisions

387
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,860
are having different ones but I say any

388
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,150
particular mesh it has to be consistent

389
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,790
there's even a provision for vendors

390
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,620
specific path selection protocols so we

391
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,690
could you know it's designed so that

392
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,350
other organizations could make up a

393
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,290
selection protocols and use their UI we

394
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:35,290
use the Eno aur to come up with our own

395
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:36,730
designation I've found ATAR to 11 to be

396
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,980
somewhat receptive to this sort of thing

397
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,470
there was a draft done in the IETF which

398
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,730
down at the bottom of this slide called

399
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:49,440
secure hybrid wireless mesh protocol and

400
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:52,540
this draft was liaison to 802 11 I think

401
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,750
and a neutral Evan said oh sure and so

402
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:58,450
they allocated a code point in the 802

403
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,310
11 space for that so you can identify

404
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,720
the past election protocol either by a

405
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:05,600
single byte or by oh oh you

406
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,110
and a sub selector for a particular

407
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,730
vendor so the 802 11 has its own

408
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,520
assigned number Authority and I just

409
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:16,520
went and looked yesterday in there and

410
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,110
there's two values in for past selected

411
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,300
protocols one is the basic one in the

412
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,909
802 11 standard and the other is this

413
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,399
secure hybrid wireless mesh protocol so

414
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,200
they allocated point to a while ago and

415
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,070
it's of course it's still allocated and

416
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:34,220
I suspect that if we proposed a path

417
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,590
selection protocol using babel for it or

418
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,230
211 mesh that they'd be happy to

419
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,659
allocate a value 3 in their space well

420
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,190
we could use our own and you know if

421
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,890
there were some extension somehow

422
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:48,830
required it's it's possible they would

423
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:50,930
do that so I don't think there's much of

424
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,060
an inter standards development

425
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,890
organization problem there and it seems

426
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,919
like the kind of thing that that will

427
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,600
should be good for because you have

428
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:07,880
obviously highly variable link metrics

429
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:10,310
in an 802 11 mesh so I have another

430
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,860
slide I was wondering could anybody in

431
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:15,409
the room or remotely or whatever has any

432
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:19,070
ideas for other possible work items

433
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:20,660
they'd like to to finish possible future

434
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:25,720
or new work items they would like to

435
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:28,640
have added to this list of stuff here

436
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,110
and if they don't want to speak up now

437
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,130
they can act we can boast to the list or

438
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:36,919
whatever later is going ahead - though I

439
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,420
think the last slide is what what should

440
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,520
be what we'll be doing I think the

441
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,830
highest priority obviously you're in the

442
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,379
short run is to get the core set of all

443
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,659
four graphs including the base protocol

444
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:51,730
graphed through the process and in the

445
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:54,560
RFC editors queue but for the long run

446
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:57,440
longer run we should discuss recharge

447
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:00,260
ring and possible new work items and we

448
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,540
can do it right now or and or our

449
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:04,820
nonetheless I mean we should we should

450
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,620
do it on the list regardless I believe

451
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,560
not to see if there's people out there

452
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:13,949
who are a favor additional work items

453
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:17,070
that to be added to our do charter

454
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:22,500
so if anybody would like to comment on

455
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:28,049
any of these charter items or possible

456
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:37,169
new work items or whatever or proposed

457
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:39,510
any additional ones now yep Barbara

458
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:42,990
Stark I don't see Julia stepping up to

459
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:45,179
the mic um and I know David is because I

460
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,049
just heard him at the microphone over

461
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:48,720
two doors down

462
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:51,000
um I think we may be just a little bit

463
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,649
distracted in this session right now and

464
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,549
it might be better just to discuss this

465
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:58,590
on the list

466
00:27:53,549 --> 00:28:00,600
sounds reasonable to me I think we

467
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,860
should if nobody had regardless of

468
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,029
whether people had things to say here

469
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,769
there's a lot of people jumped up and

470
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:07,830
they all said there should be absolutely

471
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:09,210
no new work oh that doesn't seem to be

472
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,360
happening I'm pretty sure we should

473
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:15,590
discuss it on the list and perhaps work

474
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:21,178
on a draft new charter language there

475
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:26,939
was a D I'm very happy Babel finds new

476
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:30,059
work to do just make sure that today's

477
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,870
day energy to effectively effectively

478
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:38,850
bring it to completion that sounds very

479
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:40,949
reasonable yeah no it has to be yep

480
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:46,918
no there's available community working

481
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:51,600
and implementing and so forth some okay

482
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:57,330
well is there any other business for the

483
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,908
working group here looks like we may

484
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,320
manage to have we originally applied for

485
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:03,630
a one hour for this lot we had an hour

486
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,960
and a half but it looks like that may be

487
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:09,269
a half hour will do us which is okay

488
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,860
because I think people have things

489
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:16,590
they'd like to do so last call for any

490
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:22,189
additional comments discussions or

491
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,189
topics here okay

492
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,009
since there seems to be plenty of time

493
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:32,269
on the available in the agenda rod Van

494
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:34,759
Meter I'm new to Babel I had never seen

495
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:36,559
it before so I just walked in to find

496
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,049
out so sort of a little bit about what

497
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,019
Babel is doing and what's going on I'm

498
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:46,039
the chair of the proposed quantum

499
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:48,289
internet research group and one of the

500
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:52,610
issues that we ultimately are dealing

501
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:54,470
with is routing and in fact the the the

502
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,600
links are potentially not very stable

503
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,149
and potentially relatively data dynamic

504
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,689
so the idea of a routing protocol that

505
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:06,110
works well with dynamic link costs as a

506
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,929
particular interest to to us fiber

507
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,899
probably varies on the granularity on

508
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:13,429
the order of an hour butBut free space

509
00:30:11,899 --> 00:30:16,129
links or satellite links could be

510
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:19,460
minutes or below so I'm curious you know

511
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:20,840
just completely off the top of my head

512
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,029
whether or not Babel is something we

513
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,990
should look at as a routing protocol for

514
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:29,929
those kinds of networks III would think

515
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:34,999
you should so that's the only

516
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:37,039
interesting and I think if you were to

517
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,470
ask that question on the list that

518
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,210
Julius would probably respond to you and

519
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,749
he's like the person who knows the most

520
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:47,149
and it's just 6:30 in the morning for

521
00:30:44,749 --> 00:30:56,119
him and my experience is he's not the

522
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:57,590
best person at 6:30 in the morning okay

523
00:30:56,119 --> 00:31:03,439
thanks for a comment that said

524
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:06,499
interesting covering yeah I was quickly

525
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:12,019
going over your slides again and it you

526
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:14,899
missed the rtt druffs no no I see in the

527
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:17,389
in this presentation okay so sorry yeah

528
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:21,439
it should be down here I guess it's it's

529
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:23,990
not something explicitly called out in

530
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:30,320
the current Charter and it's something

531
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:32,600
that is already it's already a working

532
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,060
group draft it seems like it's sort of

533
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,040
ascetic it's a kind of part of the

534
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,440
protocol draft I think I guess I

535
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,540
considered it to kind of fall under

536
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:47,410
under the existing work it should have

537
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:51,710
been listed there it is a let's see here

538
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:54,620
go back to the status of documents here

539
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:57,530
so so yeah so that's down there is it is

540
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:01,820
a working group graphed we could for

541
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:03,500
example do a working group last call on

542
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,679
it if he will believe that draft isn't

543
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,140
good enough shape for that that would be

544
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:15,230
a reasonable thing to do it's in could a

545
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:16,820
current work do you think that it is do

546
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,170
you have an opinion on whether we should

547
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:30,710
do a working group last call for that

548
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:33,500
document I think we really need to ask

549
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:36,320
you're talking about specific no no the

550
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,410
RTT extension I thought nobody asked

551
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,720
about oh the RTG round trip time

552
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,340
extension I mean I think that's another

553
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:50,960
thing we probably need to take to the

554
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:53,300
list okay so we can ask on the list

555
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,850
whether what comments people have on

556
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,169
that draft and if there's no you know

557
00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:00,080
whether they believe it we should do a

558
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:03,470
glass call yep yeah rollin tilta I

559
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,290
should go review it and I will I should

560
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,400
go and review it okay excellent cool if

561
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:10,810
you could review it and post your

562
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:16,070
comments that would be right okay

563
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:19,310
anything else from anybody okay we

564
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:22,159
measure sent the emails and Nick glance

565
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:24,530
and we send out a declaration that the

566
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,630
yang model has passed working request

567
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:29,860
call a little bit later today

568
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:32,060
and I think with that that concludes

569
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:34,909
about the working group meeting for this

570
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:39,500
time so thanks for barbara for taking

571
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:42,610
minutes and see you on the list and the

572
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,610
next IDF meeting

573
