1
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:25,660
and icon yes

2
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:36,350
welcome to qi RG quantum internet

3
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:40,160
research group still proposed as of our

4
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,079
current status let's see I am rod Van

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,370
Meter and I will be running today's

6
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,859
meeting welcome and the blue sheets have

7
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,559
just begun now circulating around so

8
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:56,719
please sign in as the blue sheets come

9
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:59,449
around let's see so we have both a

10
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,210
scribe and a and a note-taker setup

11
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:05,810
Thank You let's say so today you all

12
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:10,280
know where and when we are for those of

13
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:13,580
you who are new to what we're doing just

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,590
a quick review of the current status the

15
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,980
idea of this a writ was originated by

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,090
Stephanie in Stephanie Vayner in January

17
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,060
of 2018

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,430
I presented remotely at the IRT F open

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,700
in March 2018 the mailing list opened

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,950
that month it's ongoing the the traffic

21
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:37,580
level is sort of low to moderate we were

22
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:40,280
approved as a proposed RG on November

23
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:43,100
6th last year in Bangkok or just prior

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:48,140
to Bangkok and the tentative proposal is

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:50,210
or was to to meet one time a year at RT

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,570
F once a year at a quantum conference

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,240
and once per year at in a virtual or

28
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:59,330
online meeting so far we have actually

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,500
achieved three face-to-face meetings at

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:06,410
IETF s 103 104 and 106 and so far for

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,860
online meetings all in the last couple

32
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:12,349
of months focusing on one of the drafts

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,240
in particular the Wojtek is leading and

34
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:16,369
so far we actually have not held a

35
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,959
meeting at one of the

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,930
quantum related meetings that will

37
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,940
happen hopefully sometime next year

38
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,069
let's see so agenda administrivia blue

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,579
blue sheets going around note-taker we

40
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,829
have done scribe agenda if anyone has

41
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:37,220
any comments at this point on the agenda

42
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:39,650
and the RG documents we have three

43
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,049
active drafts which we will be looking

44
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,849
at there's a fourth report to there

45
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:48,829
under RG business on qkd in SSL and then

46
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:52,310
I hope to run an open mic discussion for

47
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:55,489
about 20 minutes or so I spent some time

48
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,819
last night this morning updating a list

49
00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:01,220
of proposed topics for discussion

50
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,859
including whether or not we whether and

51
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,890
how to move from proposed RG to our Jeep

52
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,560
or perhaps in Vancouver suggestions for

53
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,589
the next meeting date advice from the

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,160
floor on what and how to move that our

55
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,110
existing IDs to our FCS beyond whatever

56
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,859
gets discussed about the documents

57
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,989
themselves and a couple of things that

58
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,470
we one thing that came up on the mailing

59
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,470
list

60
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,090
just recently denial of service attacks

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:31,299
and integration of quantum internet

62
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,769
services into the larger internet

63
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,359
there's no documents associated with

64
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:37,130
that but it's been actively discussed on

65
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:38,900
the mailing list if anybody has any

66
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,630
comments during the open mic section and

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,950
also potentially a list of things to

68
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:48,139
take on next including suggestion from

69
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,690
from the mailing list on qkd

70
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:53,510
architecture or how to integrate qkd

71
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,760
into the internet architecture naming

72
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,500
and addressing of nodes came up early

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,319
this year and has not been and has sort

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,370
of gotten pushed aside as a discussion

75
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,138
issue routing quantum resistant crypto

76
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,239
or PKI and how do you integrate that in

77
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:11,389
and security of the networks all of

78
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,700
these things came up earlier so any

79
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:18,700
suggestions comments questions on the

80
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,700
agenda

81
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:33,000
: hey Colin partners just a note that

82
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:35,070
some of the security working groups have

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,900
quantum resistant crypto things to make

84
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,450
sure you're talking to them yes

85
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,400
absolutely the point would be the point

86
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,930
of doing that in this venue would be to

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,060
coordinate with them rather than rather

88
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,830
than have it go on in some some way

89
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,410
that's completely unrelated to IETF or

90
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,940
IR gf Thanks anything else on the agenda

91
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,470
the details of these specific items we

92
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,800
can talk and we can talk about in the

93
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:06,810
latter part of the meeting itself if not

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,730
first item up white deck draft IRT fqi

95
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,290
RG principles let's say you want to use

96
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:23,340
this device all right let me find the

97
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:32,240
slides architectural principles of a

98
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:35,460
quantum Internet how's that okay

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,650
everybody I'm gonna talk about the work

100
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,849
we've been working on on the draft on

101
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:44,750
the architectural principles of the

102
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:48,240
quantum Internet there's a brief recap

103
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,700
as a brief recap the first version was

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,390
prepared and presented at the IETF in

105
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:56,280
Prague in March the main motivation for

106
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,289
bringing it forward to the key are G's

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,359
to address actually one of the charter

108
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,890
points which is that to create an

109
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,680
architectural framework delineating

110
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:06,419
network node roles and definitions to

111
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,010
build a common vocabulary and serve as

112
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:12,600
the first step toward a quantum network

113
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:14,550
architecture and also because the IETF

114
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,860
is mostly people who don't know quantum

115
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,570
mechanics at all and also to create a

116
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,610
good starting point for people with no

117
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,770
quantum background and kind of service

118
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,300
that document you would read if you want

119
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,450
to kind of understand what the

120
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,370
challenges problems are and how do these

121
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,280
things relate to the other work done in

122
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,390
the IETF

123
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,450
the draft was adopted and at that

124
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,280
meeting

125
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,409
after that first meeting I received a

126
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,059
lot of comments but the first round of

127
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,400
comments was actually mostly either

128
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,650
editorial or they're very vague

129
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,140
open-ended questions would be good to

130
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:52,270
add this would be good to do that and so

131
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,090
towards like in the run-up to this

132
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,590
meeting and I eventually organized some

133
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,640
web calls through which we started

134
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:01,960
actually going through these open-ended

135
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:06,460
questions as a group rather than just me

136
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,469
hiding away and trying to do all that as

137
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,570
part of that I've set up the work on

138
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,910
github we're not actually it's

139
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,219
convenient because it lets us share

140
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,870
updates at a finer granularity then they

141
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,790
strike her and do convene diffs and

142
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,740
people know who know good help know how

143
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,740
to navigate it but we're still doing all

144
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,970
discussions to the mailing list and

145
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,710
essentially I don't think there was

146
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:32,170
enough inertia to move too much to get

147
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:33,940
to github so before view I will actually

148
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,950
go into more detail for those who don't

149
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,920
actually and I was going on but a brief

150
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,409
overview of the changes since March 3

151
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,870
new authors have been added and multiple

152
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,940
small editorial changes has been updated

153
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,300
to the security stuff in the draft and

154
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:51,730
I've we've reworked two sections to

155
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,250
essentially better address the concerns

156
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,630
and provide a better understanding of

157
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,330
the situation to people with a

158
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:03,190
networking background but no quantum

159
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:04,510
background for those who have been

160
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:06,100
monitoring the mailing list not all

161
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,020
contributions have been reflected that

162
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,390
have been made and the run-up to the

163
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,609
meeting essentially goes busy in Penang

164
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:15,430
getting sunburned on my shins instead

165
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:17,740
rather than incorporating changes and so

166
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,890
here's a list of the things I still well

167
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,270
as a group we still need to do a run has

168
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,849
provided quite a lot of comments by only

169
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,109
incorporated some of them and to do with

170
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,750
section 4 and 5 but there's still quite

171
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:32,070
a lot to go through there is a sub

172
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:34,690
section written by Sarah and my fellow

173
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,880
about link generation I just have to

174
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,950
incorporate still and there's a pull

175
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,780
request and github from Patrick about

176
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,110
encodings which I still have to actually

177
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,199
look at so what were the major updates

178
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,130
the major updates are to do with

179
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,800
security and

180
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,939
works and it's kind of actually an

181
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,579
interesting thing security I think

182
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,430
because we do kind of have a clean slate

183
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,580
and it's kind of not a secret that

184
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:03,040
security is kind of poor on the non

185
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,080
quantum internet and so it would be good

186
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
to get a right especially since one of

187
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:10,780
their selling points of building quantum

188
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,370
networks is better security so I think

189
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,189
it would be good not to kind of delegate

190
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:18,400
it to a second-rate question which is

191
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,750
too easy to do and there are two updates

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,880
to Section four section four is

193
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,800
essentially about a kind of a more clear

194
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,750
description of what's the lifecycle of

195
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,120
entanglement in the network entanglement

196
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,490
being the key resource in a contra

197
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,650
network as you created used in delivered

198
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,600
and updated section five intercept

199
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,939
because essentially it's not clear to

200
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,620
the non quantum audience is that a

201
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,910
classical the number there that a

202
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,250
non-core network which is what we call

203
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,230
classical network is actually a key part

204
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,690
of a quantum network the quantum network

205
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,590
won't exist in isolation it will heavily

206
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:52,090
lean on and use the networks built we

207
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,760
already have like the public Internet

208
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,910
and hence we will have a dual quantum

209
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,230
classical data plane so what was the

210
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:04,600
update to security essentially that the

211
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,220
point is in a quantum network user data

212
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,430
is not actually and enter the network

213
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,900
and the network delivers so-called

214
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,819
entangled pairs and these entangled

215
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,000
pairs are used to teleport the user data

216
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,440
by passing the network however there are

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,480
still security considerations because

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,130
you can leak information which could

219
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,080
allow a malicious third party to

220
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,370
intercept your communication and there's

221
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,490
obviously also questions about

222
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:30,640
authenticity integrity stuff

223
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,020
however most crypto applications and

224
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,939
most security applications essentially

225
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,430
do that kind of security at the

226
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,470
application level and so as long as the

227
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,459
quantum network kind of satisfies the

228
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,890
model of a entangled pair source and the

229
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,180
network itself should not tackle at all

230
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,310
the questions of integrity

231
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,510
confidentiality and authenticity that's

232
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,550
up to the application and and an

233
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,589
interesting question is because it's

234
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,420
fidelity which is the quality of the

235
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,500
entanglement you deliver if it's less

236
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,660
than one kind of means you've leaked

237
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,529
information but because it's not it's

238
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,300
not actually

239
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:06,399
doesn't mean here communication is not

240
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,269
less secure it actually just means that

241
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,730
your applications will have a lower rate

242
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:15,040
because they have to abort more attempts

243
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:19,540
than they would otherwise with a with

244
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,160
better entanglement however and so that

245
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,420
was just about end-to-end security but

246
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,860
there's also obviously a lot of security

247
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,569
in the network and I was actually

248
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,829
ordinary mentioned on the question that

249
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:28,599
kind of came up but it's not actually

250
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:30,099
considered well yet are things like

251
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,519
denial of service attacks and kind of

252
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,850
network level threats and which as far

253
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,980
as I know are completely untouched I've

254
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,690
put a point that I think it's likely

255
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,360
will piggyback on classical solutions

256
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,470
but I actually have no idea there's a

257
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,339
question mark of whether this should

258
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:51,160
actually make it into this draft another

259
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,199
major update and was an update to the

260
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,120
life cycle of entanglement and as we

261
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:59,680
read tend to clarify the whole process

262
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,420
for the purposes of and now the reader

263
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,120
with a networking background by with no

264
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,819
quantum background and again when I

265
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,709
wrote the draft first I kind of wrote it

266
00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:10,870
from my perspective which is a physicist

267
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,569
perspective with networking knowledge

268
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:17,050
and but that's not actually the audience

269
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:18,459
we're targeting so based on the calls it

270
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,899
was kind of a lot of issues where they

271
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:24,518
became clear as to where we should

272
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:27,399
clarify etcetera so as part of those

273
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,949
changes so first in the updated section

274
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,630
we illustrate now the challenges to do

275
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,969
with what what's the main challenge of

276
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,829
in a quantum network and essentially in

277
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,540
a quantum network with there some major

278
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:40,239
challenges are the fact such as the

279
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,500
measurement problem in a classical

280
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
network you can look at your packet you

281
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,459
can actually read the headers and you

282
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,949
can relive in the user data if you so

283
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:49,479
wish and you can't do that in a quantum

284
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:52,269
network when you do you destroy your

285
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,730
data and your entire state so you cannot

286
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:57,160
do that which kind of already already in

287
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,630
that it makes copying difficult and why

288
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,639
what makes copying really difficult is

289
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,350
the no-cloning theorem you cannot

290
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,649
actually copy anything in the quantum

291
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,600
world copying is basically how you do

292
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,670
networking and you can't do that in

293
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,560
classical and quantum networking at all

294
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,269
it's just physically impossible it's not

295
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,279
a it's not a technological limitation I

296
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:17,170
was actually key to know this is

297
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,529
a fundamental limitation of quantum

298
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,240
mechanics and the last challenge is

299
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,769
fidelity so in quiet in classical

300
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,600
networks when you deliver a packet you

301
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,759
basically either deliver it perfectly or

302
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,439
you don't so you drop it by checking the

303
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,779
checksum if it doesn't match you drop it

304
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:34,230
and quantum networks delivering a

305
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:37,720
perfect state is incredibly challenging

306
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,999
technologically potentially impossible

307
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,100
but also most applications don't

308
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:43,749
actually need perfect states so they can

309
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,839
actually get away with in perfect states

310
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:48,069
and the key point to note about that is

311
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,360
that imperfect states means you can

312
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:50,769
deliver them faster so there's a

313
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,149
trade-off between the quality of state

314
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,850
and the rate which you can deliver

315
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,110
things however as I point out below a

316
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,050
kind of mixed trends these kind of

317
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,999
things makes transmission difficult and

318
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,949
the point is rather than in a classical

319
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,540
Iowa query we send bits from source to

320
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:06,040
destination we were not going to be

321
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,449
doing that and in Contra now we're not

322
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,050
delivering a qubit from source to

323
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:13,628
destination instead we will distribute

324
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,099
entangled pairs of particles to the two

325
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:16,959
end points and the two end points are

326
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,730
then free to do what they please were

327
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,258
those entangled pairs and one of those

328
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,180
things they can do with those entangled

329
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,550
pairs is quantum teleportation which is

330
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,479
data transmission quantum data

331
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,099
transmission and the life cycle of and

332
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,189
tango and roughly like what it perceives

333
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,269
basically first you generate

334
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:36,309
entanglement on a link you generate a

335
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:40,750
pair on individual links on your path on

336
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:43,059
all of them potentially in parallel so

337
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,649
now you have an entangled pair on every

338
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:46,480
link on your path from source to

339
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:48,250
destination and then you combine them

340
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,110
using a technique called entanglement

341
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,629
swapping where you can actually combine

342
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,449
neighboring and tangled pairs to create

343
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:57,009
a longer bell pair and at the end you

344
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:59,319
want to deliver that pair those two

345
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,759
qubits that form that one pair to the

346
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:02,139
endpoints who are actually going to then

347
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,269
use it for things such as quantum

348
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:06,069
teleportation but before you deliver to

349
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,689
it to the end of an application there's

350
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:09,160
three things you have to consider how

351
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,429
the corrections what that effectively

352
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:17,529
means is you have to either deliver

353
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:19,899
always the same pair to the endpoints or

354
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:22,360
you because there's one of four possible

355
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,490
pairs that can be delivered and so you

356
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,449
either always deliver the same one so

357
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,100
essentially you have to do the pilot

358
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,229
correction to bring it to the same state

359
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,390
or you actually tell the end

360
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,490
I know it's what you have delivered to

361
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,260
them another key important feature is

362
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,050
that the two end nodes must be able to

363
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,430
identify which qubit of theirs belongs

364
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,060
to which belters they can coordinate

365
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,069
actions on the same entangled pair if

366
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,079
that information is lost having just one

367
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,630
qubit of a pair but not knowing where

368
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,010
the other end point is is useless you

369
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,050
might as well just throw it away

370
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,819
and another important point is you need

371
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,069
an estimate of the quality of the state

372
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,610
that you have been delivered if you

373
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,290
don't have an estimate basically you

374
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,730
then just have to rely on other

375
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,640
higher-level processes which means that

376
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,750
your performance will degrade can't

377
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:13,750
yeah you can't optimize base base you

378
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,380
can't ask the network for what you

379
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:22,720
actually want so just to highlight with

380
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:25,230
an illustration of what I mean so if

381
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,790
this is like a three node network ABC

382
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:30,370
you'd first generate an entangled pair

383
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,890
between a and B and B and C so here's

384
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,440
one entangled pair X 1 X 2 and another

385
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,810
entangled pair Y 1 y 2 there's being a

386
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,790
qubit another qubit Y one thing to keep

387
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,729
in a way to being a qubit squiggly line

388
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:45,400
denoting entanglement between them and

389
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:49,210
entanglement swap basically takes X 2

390
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,640
and y 1 and perform some operations on

391
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:54,520
them and you end up with a entangled

392
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,230
pair that spans from X 1 to X 2 by

393
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,110
performing on the operations our node B

394
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:03,250
you do have to send some classical bits

395
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:05,620
between from B to either end node so

396
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,030
it's not entirely done just by B there

397
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,869
needs to be some coordination at a

398
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,869
higher level as well

399
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,780
was about the lifecycle of entanglement

400
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,929
and other work that was done was about

401
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,730
the network model and effectively what

402
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,310
does the network look like because I was

403
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,440
actually a big question and raised by a

404
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:25,849
lot of people and from a networking

405
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,290
background and essentially the biggest

406
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:30,350
question was like a biggest confusion

407
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,629
was like are we using qubits to encode

408
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,980
header information or not and that's or

409
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,380
is no we're not using qubits to encode

410
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,310
header information and so what are the

411
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,980
actual challenges

412
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,290
so first illustrate the model by

413
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,750
Lestrange the challenges we have when

414
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,490
building quantum networks

415
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:49,520
number one being there is no equivalent

416
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,500
of a payload carrying packet we're in

417
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,720
the classical in a normal network we're

418
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,040
used to having payload and a bunch of

419
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,100
headers attached to that tell the

420
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,379
network or we're gonna do with it this

421
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,649
does this is not possible in a quantum

422
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,260
network

423
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,730
it kind of is resembles also like

424
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,230
transport networks and or you can have

425
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,060
just like optical networks where you

426
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,290
can't actually read the header data so

427
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,310
there are some similarities over there

428
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:15,560
there are also many differences as well

429
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,120
an entangled pair is only useful if you

430
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,679
actually know where both qubits are so

431
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,729
one of the key roles of a network is

432
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,130
actually keeping track of this

433
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,540
information and you can't just send a

434
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,430
qubit one way in another qubit on its

435
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,899
merry way and hope for the best

436
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,270
you actually have to know at all times

437
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,480
where they are actually not at all times

438
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,530
not gonna be that strict but when it's

439
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,480
delivered when you actually wanna make

440
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:38,870
use of your entangled pair you do have

441
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,430
to know who and where it holds the other

442
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,570
parent have to be able to identify it

443
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:47,600
unambitious lee another key difficulty

444
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,340
is that generating and time requires

445
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,169
temporary state when you receive a

446
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,760
packet in a normal Network you kind of

447
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,900
just look at his headers look at your

448
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,320
routing table and you throw it out

449
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,790
another an output port it's kind of a

450
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,220
bit more difficult in a quantum network

451
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,680
because your qubits arrived separately

452
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,630
from the control information you have to

453
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,360
maintain state to correlate their

454
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,840
control information with your qubits and

455
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,939
vice versa

456
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,659
and so therefore there is a bit of a

457
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:19,160
disparity again some similarities to

458
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,330
gmpls networks and however generating

459
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,700
and turn entanglement is actually

460
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,800
paralyzed above operation because since

461
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,080
we're not transmitting user data

462
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,780
you can actually just generate all these

463
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:31,100
individual link pairs in parallel they

464
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,320
don't have you don't have to wait to

465
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,740
generate the next one only after you're

466
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,629
done with the first one and so it means

467
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,580
quite importantly that you're going to

468
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,110
be doing a lot of things in parallel and

469
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,909
it's quite important for optimization

470
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:47,540
purposes to actually do these things in

471
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:48,860
parallel and here's the point that kind

472
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,629
of just to really drive at home

473
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,800
classical communication is necessary

474
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,710
quantum networks were leaned very

475
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,659
heavily on the existing classical

476
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,970
infrastructure for two reasons

477
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,130
number one is you need to be able to

478
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:04,160
communicate classical bits of

479
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,050
information and between the various

480
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,930
nodes one example is in an entanglement

481
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,060
swap you actually have to tell the next

482
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,410
node what was the result of your

483
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,270
operation because the result of the

484
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,420
entanglement swap operation is actually

485
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,160
a number between 0 and 3 so there's four

486
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,410
possible outcomes and that has to be

487
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,470
sent to the receiver to the other end

488
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:26,060
and this has to do with the four at

489
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,910
possible entangled pairs that you can

490
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,280
create another reason why you want

491
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:33,230
classical communication is simply the

492
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,850
same reason why you want to have that in

493
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,430
a normal network you want to do routing

494
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,870
you're gonna do signalling you want to

495
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,280
be able to set up circuits you want to

496
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,050
do a bunch of management stuff and

497
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,760
there's no point in doing that with a

498
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:47,360
quantum network we already have a bunch

499
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,340
of stuff that works and again I'm gonna

500
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,020
go back to the example of gmpls because

501
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,820
there's a lot of similarities and

502
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:57,950
actually theirs has already been work on

503
00:20:52,820 --> 00:21:00,230
doing some quantum with J MPLS I also

504
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,610
added like actually defined the elements

505
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,920
of a quantum network a quantum network

506
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,510
will consist of contrary features

507
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,920
quantum it features are effectively the

508
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:11,240
devices that perform the entanglement

509
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,830
swaps they're the kind of way we get a

510
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,050
past the fact that we can't amplify

511
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,699
signals I've pointed out that they're

512
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,169
automated and controllable because for

513
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,540
example if you want to build a long link

514
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,160
you can't just lay down a long fiber

515
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,440
because eventually you lose your signal

516
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,000
and you can't just put small amplifiers

517
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,660
or something along the way you basically

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,400
have to put full quantum repeaters and

519
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,050
but these contractors will probably be

520
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,240
fully automated in the same way just

521
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,930
have a simple switch layer to switch or

522
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,550
something

523
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,350
I distinguish quantum routers from

524
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,710
quantum repeaters to kind of distinguish

525
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,240
and knows that have a control plane so a

526
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:46,710
quantum router would still be a repeater

527
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,690
because it's capable of performing an

528
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,160
entanglement swap but if it has to make

529
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,840
decisions such as like well I actually

530
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,730
have more than just two links I'm not

531
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,370
just going from one side to the other

532
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,100
side I'm actually I can probably may

533
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,989
have to make decisions and so these kind

534
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,280
of repeaters will have a control plane

535
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,050
and there's actually distinction between

536
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:06,240
these two you'll have automated nodes

537
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,490
fully automated notes simply performing

538
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,000
repeating of operations and you'll have

539
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:14,010
essentially nodes with a control plane I

540
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,050
distinguish end nodes because end notes

541
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,280
can be simpler than a contributor they

542
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,169
don't have to be able to perform an

543
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,550
entanglement swap they don't even need

544
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,980
to have a quantum memory they can

545
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,110
literally just receive their end of the

546
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,730
pair and measure immediately so there's

547
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,990
actually smaller requirements in the end

548
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,180
nodes than on the intermediate nodes

549
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:32,220
there may be non quantum nodes to

550
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,140
perform management tasks a centralized

551
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,420
controller and obviously you will have

552
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,470
quantum links and classical links and to

553
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,490
kind of again highlight the fact that

554
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,080
you have two data planes you have a

555
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,440
quantum data plane and a classical data

556
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,419
plane a kind of an illustration of what

557
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,570
it all looks like you will have

558
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:51,710
applications at the top communicating

559
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:54,030
with each other over a classical channel

560
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:57,570
the applications will run on end nodes

561
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:59,720
and these end nodes will be connected

562
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,939
via a physical link at the bottom and

563
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,740
straight and that physical link will

564
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,240
most likely also be the quantum channel

565
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,270
through which they distribute air qubits

566
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,680
but a important point kind of an

567
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,050
important point to make is they will

568
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,400
also need a classical channel to

569
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,899
communicate the control information I

570
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
was discussing but that classical

571
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,320
channel doesn't have to be essentially

572
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,570
the same physical link as the quantum

573
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,730
Channel it can be completely separate

574
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,840
and they can share that thing there I'm

575
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,640
pretty sure there are technologies to

576
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,889
share quantum and Confirmation on the

577
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,490
same fiber as many ways of implementing

578
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:34,690
that but that's kind of not part of this

579
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:37,029
draft

580
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,580
looking forward and what else is there

581
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,080
to do I'm going to finalize the updates

582
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,549
to sections four and five based on the

583
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,649
feedback from the last call from 11th of

584
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:46,359
November I've mentioned there's a few

585
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:50,619
pipeline changes still need to be

586
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:52,809
incorporated and and another work to do

587
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:54,999
is like whilst we don't really tackle

588
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:56,918
too much physical stuff physical layer

589
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:58,389
stuff in the draft it is very important

590
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,580
to highlight what are the difficulties

591
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:03,939
brought into the architecture based on

592
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,989
physical constraints essentially one of

593
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,909
the biggest constraints is memory

594
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:08,259
lifetimes and you can only store qubit

595
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,700
currently technology lets you store

596
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,349
cubes for a very very short amount of

597
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,070
time which require very strict timing

598
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:16,178
controls and then essentially the

599
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,220
purpose of the draft was to kind of

600
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:19,809
outline the goals and principles of how

601
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,700
would you design a quantum Internet and

602
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,408
that's kind of still untouched and I've

603
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,789
got some feedback on that and but that

604
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:26,440
will essentially now that we've kind of

605
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:29,408
laid down the foundation for a better

606
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,669
understanding or what's going on and to

607
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:32,619
kind of now move on to the goals and

608
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,559
principles and I put down Network level

609
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:36,999
security with a question mark and it's

610
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:38,168
good question should it should it end up

611
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:40,960
here or should not sure to have a

612
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:43,749
separate and it should be separate work

613
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,429
and I don't really want to delat

614
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:47,710
relegate security to a second-rate

615
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:48,970
concern because it's actually say since

616
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,960
these content networks are built around

617
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,059
the idea that they're going to be more

618
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,809
secure it's kind of important to tackle

619
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:58,570
any concerns that might arise and that's

620
00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,700
it for me all right so that was actually

621
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:04,479
about 19 minutes out of our twenty

622
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,820
minutes get scheduled for this but the I

623
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:08,049
only have 60 minutes of agenda items and

624
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,928
we have a 90 minute session so it's

625
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:14,739
totally okay by me if we run over on

626
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,820
this for however much QA we have because

627
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:18,460
I think this is the single most

628
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:22,529
important item we're actually working on

629
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,529
in the group so questions from the floor

630
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:35,410
[Music]

631
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:38,559
name two busy Nalini Elkins now I'm just

632
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,480
wandering into this slowly but and I

633
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,780
will tell you that my I have had a very

634
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:48,490
misspent life focusing on measurement

635
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:51,190
and diagnostics and so so so I get the

636
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:55,840
jitters you know when you say you can't

637
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:58,840
measure anything and having said that

638
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,649
the success of all this depends on a

639
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,620
good management system so so I'm just

640
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:08,260
curious you know because I was kind of

641
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:12,159
going through and thinking well what are

642
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:16,090
the parameters one would need for this

643
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:18,220
good management system and what can be

644
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:20,860
thought of you know I mean what can be

645
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,650
measured like number of like where

646
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,740
qubits were at a particular location and

647
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,990
how many you did or you know I mean I'm

648
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:33,340
just I'm just I just want to get your

649
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:35,230
thoughts on on all this rambling yeah so

650
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,699
that the examples you've given like are

651
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,580
good examples you kind of keep track of

652
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,330
essentially like for example the

653
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,230
entangled pairs come with our IDs so

654
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,210
when these entangled pairs are generated

655
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,549
even on a link they come with an ID so

656
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,260
you can keep track of the ID well comes

657
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:53,590
with meet means we have to build the

658
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:59,559
protocols yet maintain yes that's our

659
00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:01,449
responsibility here in this room yes I

660
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:02,860
say allocate an identifier to entangled

661
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,630
pairs and they can keep try and actually

662
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,699
one part important thing to actually

663
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,410
keep track of is which entangled pair

664
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,820
have you entangled with which entangled

665
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,250
pair because it's actually critical in

666
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,540
their end to end delivery so that's one

667
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,540
thing you can definitely keep track of

668
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,639
and you can keep track of failures to

669
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,100
generate on the link you can keep track

670
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,360
of how many have successfully generated

671
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,290
the entanglement generation it's kind of

672
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,790
still missing from the draft because

673
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,320
it's one of the pipe light changes but

674
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,389
actually the entanglement generation and

675
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,659
link is heralded so you actually get a

676
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,070
notification and when an entangled pair

677
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,320
is generated so that's something you can

678
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,350
keep a

679
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,700
tract of information of and actually

680
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,290
there's also a lot of other information

681
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,140
mostly this other information is kind of

682
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:46,680
metadata like such as like when did your

683
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:49,080
parents accessory generated which time

684
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,600
bin and when did you perform operations

685
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,669
and it what result it came out was

686
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,080
delivered successfully and so on

687
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,780
there's obviously anything we can keep

688
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,679
track of anything apart from we don't

689
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,910
actually need to measure the cubit the

690
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,980
cubit actually doesn't carry anything

691
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,600
interesting to the network the only

692
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,820
thing we cannot measure at all is

693
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,760
effectively the fidelity we can only

694
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:12,240
have an estimate of the fidelity there

695
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,280
really is no good way I think of because

696
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,020
to measure fidelity would have to repeat

697
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,790
the generation multiple times and then

698
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,320
measure it multiple times and have to

699
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,700
make sure that it's the same area that

700
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,740
you've performed the same thing many

701
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,670
times so that's the only one thing that

702
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,200
I think would be difficult to measure

703
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:30,720
everything else is fine like what would

704
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,400
be the things I mean if the group thinks

705
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,020
that's an interesting topic I'd

706
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:39,180
certainly be interested in working on

707
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:41,490
something like that let me take a

708
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,020
process interrupt for one second blue

709
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,760
sheets if you have not signed the blue

710
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,930
sheets please do there's one up here in

711
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:51,300
the front I'm not sure where the other

712
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:54,420
one got to okay yes so the model here

713
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,639
which is great in some ways says that

714
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,800
there are n nodes for which we're

715
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,020
computations and applications run and

716
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,480
then they're repeaters which allow you

717
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,780
to build longer lengths and more complex

718
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,400
topologies out of the communication

719
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,980
channels with both the classical in the

720
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,570
quantum so something that's happening in

721
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,730
parallel in this community is something

722
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,399
called computing in the network where

723
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,470
intermediate devices in the network that

724
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,090
we classically think of as either just

725
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,370
repeaters or switches are also doing

726
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,110
computation so I'm curious what happens

727
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,550
to this model if the things that you're

728
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:31,409
calling quantum repeaters are actually

729
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:33,060
quantum computers and the this internet

730
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:36,030
thing this quantum internet thing is

731
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:41,909
actually sort of a way to distribute a

732
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:43,530
quantum computation it's a good point I

733
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,120
think Rodney actually often calls the

734
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,250
problem of distributing entanglement as

735
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,080
a distributed computation

736
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,580
but it would be a distributed classical

737
00:29:49,080 --> 00:30:06,510
computation to deliver the entangled

738
00:29:50,580 --> 00:30:08,460
pairs so yeah well there's there yes

739
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,110
there are actually multiple choices of

740
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,240
operations that can be done besides just

741
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:15,030
the entanglement swapping most having to

742
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,580
do with with error management but you're

743
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,840
exactly you're exactly right and and as

744
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:21,960
what tech said you know I often call

745
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,610
this really a it's not store-and-forward

746
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,650
building an end-to-end connection is a

747
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,240
distributed computation and in fact

748
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,490
right before the meetings started here I

749
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,730
was talking to a Aaron Falk about about

750
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:35,390
the the coin work and and I really think

751
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:37,290
there's a lot of potential at least

752
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,360
intellectual synergy I'm not sure if

753
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,129
there's actual technological overlap or

754
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,679
not and that's that's something I'd love

755
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:47,040
to pursue with with the coin people you

756
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,700
and even whoever else hi their news

757
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,250
Moira

758
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,010
and so I had the pleasure to play around

759
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:56,760
a little bit with kis kids so the IBM

760
00:30:53,010 --> 00:31:00,270
quantum computing hub and so what I did

761
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:03,180
was initialize 50 cubits with 0 perform

762
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,160
a no operation and measure the results

763
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,850
and I think in 50% of the cases at least

764
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:12,810
one qubit flipped so without performing

765
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:14,669
any operation right so what you do about

766
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:18,240
this if you're talking already about

767
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:22,620
routing and maintaining a state what do

768
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,480
you do about bit flipping there so there

769
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,979
are quantum error correction codes

770
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,450
they're not really considered in the

771
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,940
near term because they have quite high

772
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,040
resource requirements and however it all

773
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,230
actually kind of comes under this guise

774
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,950
of fidelity so fidelity kind of also

775
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:39,660
encodes potential bit flips essentially

776
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,880
how close you are to your desired state

777
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,800
and effectively what it means is that

778
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,470
your end-to-end application which is

779
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:49,610
performing some security protocol will

780
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:52,380
effectively detect an abort transactions

781
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,699
it detects that you it's got at least

782
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,470
too much information into the

783
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,330
environment so that's how it's going to

784
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,040
be dealt a near term in the future there

785
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,629
will probably be proper quantum error

786
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,930
correction codes implemented there's

787
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,880
also

788
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:05,300
the idea of distillation but I don't

789
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,470
think the solution would solve bit flips

790
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,200
it's all about like delivering a better

791
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,990
pair but yeah error correction is kind

792
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,670
of a more long-term concern and we deal

793
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,930
with imperfect states as was what we

794
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,730
have now it basically just reduces the

795
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:19,950
right with which you can deliver at the

796
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,620
end okay thank you

797
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:25,710
so the the distillation that we tech

798
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:29,689
just mentioned is in effect it's error

799
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,690
detection as opposed to error correction

800
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:37,980
pollution I have a question I'm

801
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,750
concerned about measurement because is

802
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,790
there a danger that when you try and

803
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,800
measure entangled pairs you may

804
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:45,810
decompose maybe a quantum system now to

805
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,010
a classical system and therefore it will

806
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:53,040
now behave more like a classical system

807
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:54,540
yeah that's why you want you don't want

808
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,250
to avoid measurement in the network I

809
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,720
accept during the entanglement so one

810
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,250
part of the integrant swap is actually

811
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,860
measurement so you will want to measure

812
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,010
it then but in that case the measurement

813
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,510
is done in a way that actually

814
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,000
transports entanglement rather than

815
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:10,230
destroying for this thing a essentially

816
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,550
they what your concern about is like

817
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,290
reducing your system to a classical

818
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,580
system is effectively decoherence so

819
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,710
interactions with the environment it

820
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,730
happens and currently it's taken to

821
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,410
account by the fact that your fidelity

822
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,270
degrades and you're going to be

823
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,460
delivering imperfect entangled pairs to

824
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:27,750
the end nodes does that answer your

825
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,430
question let's close off the line with

826
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,960
the two people who are here in line

827
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,000
there both of you are there that fine

828
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,440
but let's let's end it there and then if

829
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,850
there's more we can do it the open mic

830
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:44,250
section at the end okay no well

831
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:46,740
developers I'm the boys that claims in

832
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:51,060
the deserts about the physical stuff and

833
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:53,400
all the like now seriously what I think

834
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,800
and and then trying to I'm taking this

835
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,110
moment just to try to clarify a little

836
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,060
bit with my thoughts we have a

837
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:03,750
conversation pending but the point is

838
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:06,659
that I think that we are running too

839
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:09,000
fast in following the same analogy with

840
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,130
the current network model of the current

841
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,960
classical network model in the sense

842
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,669
that we're assuming that there's going

843
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,500
to be a physical physical

844
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:20,879
physically we live in a physical world

845
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:23,040
that's but thing is about talking about

846
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,759
links talking about Network talking

847
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,960
about application I think that we are I

848
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,829
mean that we are running too fast

849
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,970
because we don't have right now the

850
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:35,280
operational experience of connecting

851
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,469
several quantum computing computers and

852
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:42,119
see what happens with them and probably

853
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:44,368
we could step back a little bit and

854
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,649
start thinking about and probably the

855
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:50,250
physical energy is not good because it's

856
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:51,690
it's as misleading as well intense that

857
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,389
when we are talking about this what we

858
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,159
have I work with an entanglement we

859
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:58,230
could be talking about we have a channel

860
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,400
we have a secret something that that

861
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,750
connects two or several because

862
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,510
theoretically my understanding is that

863
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:09,329
you can connect at the same time with

864
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,950
you don't need pairs of entanglements

865
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:15,690
you can't look event an entanglement

866
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:18,000
with several ends thinking about setting

867
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:21,480
but that so far what we know is about

868
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,670
building entanglements that we know what

869
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,549
can be done is building entanglements

870
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:28,829
and calling them out whatever call it

871
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:31,170
whatever probably would avoid the term

872
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:33,839
link or whatever this is equal in the

873
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,849
air in the air in the classical network

874
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,700
case and tried to elaborate over this

875
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:40,380
that that was my my my point probably

876
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,589
was not clear on the list and this is

877
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,579
why I wanted to trances here is it's

878
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:50,670
about trying to avoid over the the

879
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:52,619
excess of analogy I'm sorry I get your

880
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:55,190
name I'm sorry did you say develop this

881
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,430
I'm over telefónica research Thanks

882
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:01,470
I'm still actually because you say avoid

883
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:04,558
analogies with the link but we won't

884
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:08,098
need the link no no no not to the link

885
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,740
avoid analogies with the current network

886
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,599
mobile with the seven layers the link

887
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,910
the physical the length the network the

888
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,190
transport etc because probably the

889
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,618
number of layers the layering etc will

890
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,849
be different yeah

891
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:24,839
actually I actually actually agree with

892
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:27,030
you and kind of that's why on the calls

893
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,440
I actually have resisted trying to put

894
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:31,079
an explicit

895
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:34,020
Nishan of layers into this draft there

896
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:36,089
is work in this in this community about

897
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,050
layers but that's fine if it's separate

898
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:38,400
because we kind of need to start

899
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,930
understanding these things but I

900
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,599
actually did try to explicitly avoid

901
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,890
talk about layers we did start talking

902
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,589
about responsibilities which having

903
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:49,230
which people try to relate to layers but

904
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:52,049
I really do want to avoid defining a

905
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,470
stack in this draft completely yes no I

906
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,470
agree with that

907
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:04,440
your name please

908
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,720
I'm actually the chair I'm actually the

909
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,790
chair or the co-chair of this coin group

910
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,259
and it's great that we're talking KO'ing

911
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:13,279
here because in coin we thought about

912
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:15,839
you guys and the ideas that we had

913
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,359
comments from the IAB about putting

914
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,040
security in our systems especially when

915
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:23,670
we start putting computing elements and

916
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:27,690
actually without a homothetic security

917
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:30,599
which is not very feasible without some

918
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:32,190
form of of quantum computer and I was

919
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,910
wondering what were your thoughts on

920
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:38,069
future of security systems inside the

921
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:43,500
network now that we have this type of

922
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:45,119
communications I actually I have not

923
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,520
thought much about security apart from

924
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,700
so very so you mean about security of

925
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,589
the in network nodes computing nodes

926
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,720
yeah and also of the overall

927
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:57,150
infrastructure that needs to be secured

928
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,560
if we're going to have access to the

929
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,630
information while it's in transit

930
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,119
because a lot of people are developing

931
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:06,480
more and more and to an encrypted system

932
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,520
and first we have to have trusted nodes

933
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,230
in the center but if there's strong

934
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,329
encryption well you know it takes a

935
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:15,450
while to decrypt them so frankly it's

936
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:17,640
not a really great idea than to put

937
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,589
computing because we never will never

938
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,750
get access to the data and we started

939
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:25,078
thinking about I'm erratic signatures

940
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:27,030
and security but again you need very

941
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,150
very high level of computations for this

942
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:32,069
and I was wondering in your system again

943
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,190
when you're thinking about how is this

944
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:37,890
going to be dealt with both from I would

945
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:40,290
say the traditional computation where

946
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:42,270
you start like they've they've said to

947
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,400
have quantum computers

948
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,660
the system but also even for your thing

949
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,820
how are you going to deal with security

950
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:51,480
it's more of a comment maybe the

951
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:53,100
question but we've we've we've because

952
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,440
we are pretty in computation and the

953
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,360
network we are very much involved in

954
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,810
thinking about what's going a bit next

955
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,700
generation of this and maybe it's here

956
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:05,040
yeah so it's probably so the only

957
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,750
security that I'm aware of that we've

958
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,820
thought about is end to end between

959
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,440
applications and I have mentioned that

960
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,120
we have not thought about any security

961
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,500
in the network yet I don't think anybody

962
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,900
has thought about any security in the

963
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,300
network for quantum stuff maybe a tiny

964
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,500
bit somewhere else but that's part of

965
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,810
that's something that rod has suggested

966
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,730
for the open mic so I would I would say

967
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:28,830
you are much closer to helping us than

968
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:30,600
we are to helping you yeah but I will

969
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,060
actually disagree so we actually have

970
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,580
one paper the title which is the network

971
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:37,950
impact of hijacking a quantum repeater

972
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,650
that actually looks at whether or not

973
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:42,419
the hijacking of an individual node in a

974
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,640
network is actually fundamentally

975
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:47,070
different from from the hijacking of an

976
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,049
individual router in the internet and we

977
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,790
found yes but it's possible to mitigate

978
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,680
it I think I actually mentioned that

979
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,380
paper on the mailing list but maybe

980
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,299
meant maybe miss Talent

981
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,890
all right um let's let's finish this

982
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,090
discussion here now if we have more to

983
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,690
talk about with this we'll still have

984
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:06,780
some time at the open mic I hope let's

985
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,930
see and now the next the next task is

986
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:13,770
actually challenging for me technically

987
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:18,419
technologically next we are to have a

988
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:21,330
remote presentation from axle on the

989
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,130
link layer protocol wants to get who

990
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:28,319
wants to show me how to run the me deco

991
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:30,990
on this or as a how do i how do I bring

992
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:37,050
it up so that axel can run run this run

993
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:45,658
the presentation remotely or aha let's

994
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:50,439
see so if I just actually you with us

995
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:52,089
yep can you hear me hot let's see do I

996
00:40:50,439 --> 00:41:04,419
run the slides from here is that what I

997
00:40:52,089 --> 00:41:05,519
do all right Axl you're up okay sound

998
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:09,939
good

999
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:14,669
speak louder speak louder yes yeah you

1000
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:14,669
hear me now good okay okay

1001
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:19,839
we're always better that will do yeah

1002
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:23,109
let me know if it's not good enough but

1003
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:26,469
I will try to speak loud so my name is

1004
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:30,399
axel Dahlberg I'm at Q Tech in doubts

1005
00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:33,580
also with Stephanie Boehner and I will

1006
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:34,828
give a brief presentation I won our

1007
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,078
[Music]

1008
00:41:34,829 --> 00:41:41,079
draft which is called the drafts Coburg

1009
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:46,059
ll quantum which you can find with this

1010
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:48,969
QR code here so this drafts is on the

1011
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:50,319
link tire service and what's the task of

1012
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:54,039
the link layer service in a quantum

1013
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:57,729
network and what would an interface be

1014
00:41:54,039 --> 00:42:00,489
through this link layer service and I

1015
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:02,828
would like to just briefly recap what

1016
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:04,749
our view of the link air service is and

1017
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:08,139
what this craft is about and also what

1018
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:11,888
changes have been made since the last

1019
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:14,979
meeting so just to be very clear so this

1020
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:17,169
is about our definition of a service so

1021
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:22,269
not of a protocol implementing this

1022
00:42:17,169 --> 00:42:26,019
service and what is then the task of a

1023
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:27,729
link layer service so depending on how

1024
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:30,308
you want to formulate it in some way or

1025
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:32,709
another in a classical network non

1026
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:33,099
quantum network the goal is to send a

1027
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:35,049
message

1028
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:39,429
classical message from one node to

1029
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:42,069
another and you might think that in a

1030
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:44,289
quantum network then the fundamental

1031
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:47,199
task would be to send a qubits from one

1032
00:42:44,289 --> 00:42:49,949
node to another however this is not the

1033
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:53,289
most fundamental operation which Voytek

1034
00:42:49,949 --> 00:42:55,959
mentioned the more fundamental operation

1035
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:58,599
is to generate entanglement and the

1036
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:59,049
reason for this is that when we have in

1037
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,200
tango

1038
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:07,180
we can use this to send qubits through

1039
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,649
teleportation so in our view the task of

1040
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,440
a link layer service is to generate

1041
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,480
entanglement between adjacent nodes in

1042
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,360
the network

1043
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,540
let me just maybe check in here if the

1044
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:23,680
if this is working and whether you can

1045
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,240
hear or understand me I can hear you

1046
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,580
receive so but you'll have to tell me

1047
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,410
when to change pages yeah okay you can

1048
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:35,440
[Music]

1049
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:40,060
okay so the task of the link layers as I

1050
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,920
mentioned is to generate entanglement it

1051
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:45,070
turns essentially a physical layer which

1052
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,750
is possible which is can make

1053
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:49,660
entanglement generation attempts that

1054
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:53,800
might fail with some probability into a

1055
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:55,569
robust service of entire generation what

1056
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,000
was also mentioned in the in the

1057
00:43:55,570 --> 00:44:00,570
previous talk is that the link layer

1058
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,800
service will give will return an

1059
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,900
identifier of this generated

1060
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,180
entanglement that can then be used in a

1061
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:10,300
network to track this entanglement and

1062
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:15,279
for nodes to agree on what qubits are

1063
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:18,750
entangled so as I mentioned this is

1064
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:21,340
about the service but if you want to

1065
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:25,060
read about a protocol that we propose

1066
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:27,250
that provides this service you can find

1067
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:29,620
this in in a paper from ours which is on

1068
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:38,140
the archive which we presented also at

1069
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:41,049
seecombe this year next slide so in in

1070
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,990
brief you how would this work so in our

1071
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:46,450
view the link layer service how you

1072
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:49,330
interact with this is that you you you

1073
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:51,790
ask it to create entanglement we do what

1074
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:54,790
we call a create message this create

1075
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:57,460
message contains a few different things

1076
00:44:54,790 --> 00:45:00,430
and I was going to the details now but

1077
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:04,000
for example you can specify what is your

1078
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:05,589
required fidelity and the reason for

1079
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,110
this is that there's usually a trade-off

1080
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:11,740
asphaltic mentioned between fidelity and

1081
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:12,610
the generation rate and not all

1082
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:16,209
applications

1083
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:19,920
requires perfect fidelity because some

1084
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:22,180
of the noise can be corrected

1085
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,800
classically in in post-processing

1086
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:29,799
and force upon generating key another

1087
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,640
type of argument in this create message

1088
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:36,070
is the type of request and we currently

1089
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,080
envisioned two types of requests where

1090
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:42,010
one is to create the entanglement and

1091
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,930
keep it in memory at the end nodes this

1092
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,490
is the difference from creating

1093
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:48,779
entanglement which is measured directly

1094
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:52,839
to generate correlated classical bits

1095
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,660
which can be used for for example key

1096
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,840
distribution or quantum key distribution

1097
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:01,480
and how this then works is that this

1098
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,630
create message is supplied from one of

1099
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:08,110
the nodes and later when entanglement is

1100
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:10,510
generated and okay or a signal is

1101
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:12,910
returned to both nodes that now there is

1102
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:19,630
entanglements and this is your qubits

1103
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:24,160
that's entangled so and I should maybe

1104
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:26,950
mention that in this draft of our link

1105
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,190
life service we've defined basically

1106
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,720
what goes into this create message as

1107
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,570
fields in the headers and we specified

1108
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:38,049
the bits of these headers which might be

1109
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:40,060
confusing and caused some confusion in

1110
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:43,750
the sense that I think this is not

1111
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:47,320
generally the way to maybe define the

1112
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:51,570
interface to a service and there's been

1113
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,570
some suggestions so maybe next slide

1114
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:59,080
from various people and I just wanted to

1115
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:01,720
briefly mention that we have we also

1116
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:05,230
have a github repo with this draft and

1117
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,879
there are current issues there and for

1118
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:10,330
example one of these issues is that we

1119
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,980
maybe shouldn't fix for example the

1120
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,680
number of bits in these fields of the

1121
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:20,290
headers but maybe we can instead use a

1122
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:24,580
type length value message to make it not

1123
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:27,100
as fixed okay but what

1124
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:32,230
has changed since the last meeting so

1125
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:34,060
next slide so this was the this is the

1126
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:39,240
new header and I just wanted to briefly

1127
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,240
mention what has changed so next slide

1128
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:44,950
one thing that's changed is that in this

1129
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,170
create message one can specify how long

1130
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,930
are you willing to wait before you

1131
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:51,250
receive your entanglement this because

1132
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:55,299
perhaps some node cannot wait

1133
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:58,870
indefinitely and we earlier had a just a

1134
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:01,600
single field which specified the next

1135
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:05,049
time one is willing to wait there's now

1136
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:08,529
a new field which specifies the time

1137
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:11,700
units of of this next time you can

1138
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:14,320
specify a maximum waiting time in

1139
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:17,370
essentially microseconds milliseconds or

1140
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:22,360
seconds so this is one of this change

1141
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:24,430
next slide the other slightly bigger

1142
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,590
change axle we have a question for just

1143
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,629
jumping really quick because we face the

1144
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:31,270
same problem somewhere else I look at

1145
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,950
something called time TLV which was

1146
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:35,380
actually done from an a a while ago

1147
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:38,379
which is a TLV encoding mantissa and

1148
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:41,530
exponent so you can choose between short

1149
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:43,510
times with high resolution or long times

1150
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,910
with low resolution with one data

1151
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:49,690
structure a Dave name for the record

1152
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:51,609
Dave I ran sorry I said the last time so

1153
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:54,190
it's probably a better encoding than a

1154
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:57,490
fixed time encoding where you have to

1155
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:59,980
choose your poison once great thank you

1156
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:04,540
very much that's very good I will

1157
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:06,060
definitely look into that so the other

1158
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,400
thing that changed which is like the

1159
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,230
technical is that as I mentioned there's

1160
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,760
this type of request where you want to

1161
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,970
generate the tournament and you want to

1162
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,440
measure it directly now in quantum

1163
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:21,609
mechanics you can measure in different

1164
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,380
bases and depending on what your

1165
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:25,420
application is you might want measuring

1166
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:30,400
different paces and you might want to

1167
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:33,310
measure in a random basis so what has

1168
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,830
now been added is more possibility to

1169
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:38,170
define what bases you want to measure in

1170
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,210
for both

1171
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:44,079
requesting note of entanglement and the

1172
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:47,289
remote node and also how to sample these

1173
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:54,430
random basis by specifying essentially a

1174
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:58,210
probability distributions next slide up

1175
00:49:54,430 --> 00:50:00,399
so I should have said next slide earlier

1176
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,769
but this was about the time units next

1177
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,420
slide yes

1178
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:08,379
so there are now new fields to specify

1179
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:11,940
the probability distributions and the

1180
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:15,940
basis is you want a measuring next slide

1181
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:18,759
so I had to get up story there's I think

1182
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:22,299
currently ten openings mostly pointed

1183
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:27,309
out by Bruno Reisman for example about

1184
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:29,799
this type length value messages and also

1185
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:34,299
something that came up earlier is about

1186
00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:35,470
the scope of a remote node when you

1187
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:39,460
specify who you want to generate

1188
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:41,859
entanglement wait and we're very happy

1189
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,619
for contributions about this so if you

1190
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:48,420
want to contribute either use the

1191
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:51,910
mailing lists or go to the github repo

1192
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:56,589
and submit pull requests or or issues

1193
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:57,129
and I'm very happy to discuss this ok

1194
00:50:56,589 --> 00:50:58,328
let's try

1195
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,069
the questions or the answers to about

1196
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:04,900
three or four minutes for this one Diego

1197
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:08,680
yeah mm-hmm developes just a suggestion

1198
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:11,549
again about the the analogies etc I well

1199
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,779
well I can understand we call this link

1200
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:16,509
though I would prefer something

1201
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:19,119
different because to avoid the analogy

1202
00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:20,799
but well let's keep it as a link what

1203
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,289
you're mentioning here what you are

1204
00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:26,009
sending when the what you call here

1205
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:28,539
headers are more I would call them

1206
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:30,880
control messages I mean you're not

1207
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:32,589
generally putting a header plus a

1208
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,930
payload with data right

1209
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,940
it's just say it says the header it's

1210
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:38,950
more like you are communicating in

1211
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,049
modernist services it's a control plane

1212
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:43,450
communicating to a data playing or to a

1213
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:46,180
quantum data playing I would talk here

1214
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:47,500
about control messages or control

1215
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,390
actions or something like that because

1216
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,000
it would be clear to understand for

1217
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:56,200
those of us who are more used to to the

1218
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,299
normal Network environment and he's and

1219
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:01,569
I think it describes better the goal of

1220
00:51:58,299 --> 00:52:05,619
the air of what you were shown I like

1221
00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:07,930
that suggestion axel sorry Dave I ran

1222
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:09,279
again so there seems to be a missing

1223
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:11,919
link here in the sense that the

1224
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:13,779
architecture document talks about the

1225
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,509
really nice fact that you can do a lot

1226
00:52:13,779 --> 00:52:19,119
of things in parallel but this seems

1227
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:21,700
like you have a very serial make one

1228
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,569
call create one entangled pair make

1229
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,390
another call

1230
00:52:22,569 --> 00:52:27,819
send another message create another

1231
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:30,848
entangled pair so I wonder if there if

1232
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:36,549
the protocol really shouldn't be some

1233
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:39,000
type of parallelized such that you can

1234
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:43,029
say you know create me 75 of these

1235
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,559
entangled pairs perhaps all with the

1236
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:45,789
same characteristic because you're going

1237
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,859
to you know you're going to do the same

1238
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:50,589
thing with all of them so I'd give some

1239
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:52,299
thought about you know given the fact

1240
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:54,880
that we have the opportunity to do a lot

1241
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:57,160
of parallelization designing a protocol

1242
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,940
that is seems to be biased to doing

1243
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:03,160
things serially so that's a very good

1244
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:06,190
point and I didn't go into the full

1245
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,480
detail of this draft but this is

1246
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,819
definitely something that's that's

1247
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,050
already there so one of the things you

1248
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:13,270
can also say in this great message

1249
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,850
how many pairs do you want so you can

1250
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:17,350
say I want a thousand pairs and I want

1251
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:20,740
to measure them directly to generate key

1252
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:23,940
you can also it's not sequential in the

1253
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:26,560
sense that you need the okay message

1254
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,380
before you send another crate you can

1255
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:31,360
submit multiple creates and this will be

1256
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,330
stored in a queue essentially and you

1257
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:40,450
can do various scheduling of these great

1258
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:41,560
messages hi Wojtek from Q tech just a

1259
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,060
clarification about what I meant by

1260
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,700
paralyzed below operations that

1261
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,560
sowhat's paralyzed about is so over here

1262
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:50,470
and this draft Axel's talking about an

1263
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:53,470
individual link and whereas if you have

1264
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:55,660
a multi hop path with say three four

1265
00:53:53,470 --> 00:53:57,279
links then you can definitely paralyze

1266
00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:00,009
those three four links where you have

1267
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,170
three or four fundamental link pairs

1268
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,880
generated at the same time rather than

1269
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,140
hub by up so that so that's one thing so

1270
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,480
the so when I said paralyzed abode

1271
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,319
that's what I meant

1272
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,430
although I do also get your point I

1273
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:13,450
guess that on that individual link you

1274
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:16,149
can also paralyze okay pollution on the

1275
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:18,279
record I went through the draft and

1276
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,620
there is actually the number field on

1277
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:25,570
the link there and it has been set to

1278
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:29,200
16-bit so the number of entangled pairs

1279
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:31,750
that can be generated is around 65,536

1280
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,879
is this a hard limit and I just wanted

1281
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:37,540
to know the design decision behind this

1282
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,850
because is this been set because maybe

1283
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,330
of a physical restriction in the number

1284
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:48,670
of entangled pairs that can be generated

1285
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:51,180
no I think comes back to the question

1286
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:54,210
that it's maybe not the best choice to

1287
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:56,919
now set the length of these fields and

1288
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:59,340
it might be better to move away from a

1289
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,340
fixed

1290
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:11,890
the question from from Java I don't have

1291
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:14,319
the name because I have asked for it and

1292
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:18,910
is not yet here but where the question

1293
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:21,700
is a federico sant andrea is asking

1294
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:24,190
whether it could be possible or useful

1295
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:28,930
to generate entanglement all the time

1296
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:30,569
and distribute pairs as needed that's a

1297
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:34,240
good question

1298
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:36,730
so why we didn't go for this approach is

1299
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:40,240
that at least in some physical systems

1300
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:42,910
it's not so advantageous to do this and

1301
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:46,149
the reason being for physical

1302
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:48,240
considerations is that in some systems

1303
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:50,140
for example the system we have in doubt

1304
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:52,270
whenever you try to generate

1305
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:54,990
entanglement you produce some noise on

1306
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:58,359
your memories so you would like to not

1307
00:55:54,990 --> 00:56:00,359
unnecessarily try to generate

1308
00:55:58,359 --> 00:56:03,369
entanglement if there's no need for it

1309
00:56:00,359 --> 00:56:08,470
so that's the motivation for not always

1310
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:10,779
trying to generate statements okay with

1311
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:14,169
my individual hat on I want to ask one

1312
00:56:10,779 --> 00:56:16,710
quickly so axle the the the new

1313
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,819
additions you talked about with the

1314
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:22,150
requests are getting to specify the

1315
00:56:18,819 --> 00:56:23,529
choice of measurement basis when you're

1316
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:26,890
when you're actually measuring the the

1317
00:56:23,529 --> 00:56:28,839
cupids out directly does that belong as

1318
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:34,680
part of the link service or should that

1319
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:36,750
be end to end well so so this is for

1320
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,919
basically I guess if there's some

1321
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:42,130
application running directly on the link

1322
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,289
so generate for example key mmm the

1323
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:46,390
reason why this is part of the

1324
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:49,270
entanglement generation request and not

1325
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:51,190
something you do after the entitlement

1326
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,910
is generated is that when you measure

1327
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,779
directly you can generally go faster

1328
00:56:53,910 --> 00:57:01,149
because you don't have to wait for

1329
00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:03,299
communication essentially to if there's

1330
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:06,250
a midpoint and or her welding station

1331
00:57:03,299 --> 00:57:07,869
yes but my point I think you think that

1332
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,549
I think that argument holds over

1333
00:57:07,869 --> 00:57:12,730
multiple hops as well as over a single

1334
00:57:09,549 --> 00:57:15,670
hop so I would argue that belongs at a

1335
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:19,089
different level in the and the the

1336
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:19,960
stream of specifications there's

1337
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:21,819
to be part of the part of the

1338
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,319
specification of the end and service

1339
00:57:21,819 --> 00:57:30,369
rather than part of the part of the link

1340
00:57:23,319 --> 00:57:32,680
specification but okay I'm not sure I

1341
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:35,349
agree because it should still need to go

1342
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:37,660
to the link layer generation service

1343
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:39,430
such that it's known already what the

1344
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,589
measurement basis is when you try to

1345
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:47,489
generate entanglement it could also come

1346
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:50,529
from higher above okay

1347
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:54,039
I'm not sure I agree but let's let's

1348
00:57:50,529 --> 00:57:58,210
let's there is more recommend that

1349
00:57:54,039 --> 00:58:00,369
anything else is it comes from which is

1350
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:02,499
it it's a number I don't know I only

1351
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:04,660
have a number but they say I agree with

1352
00:58:02,499 --> 00:58:08,558
wrong that they measure immediately

1353
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:10,509
logically belongs in a hika layer the

1354
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,700
transport layer but I am sure Diego

1355
00:58:10,509 --> 00:58:14,039
won't like the name and that's true I

1356
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,649
don't like it

1357
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:19,089
okay thanks axel I hope you're hanging

1358
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:21,460
around there may be more questions for

1359
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:25,599
you later yeah let's see if I can figure

1360
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:25,900
out how to turn you off anything thank

1361
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:34,569
you

1362
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:34,779
let's see good okay see if this is gonna

1363
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:40,450
work

1364
00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:42,489
um so my own internet draft on

1365
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:46,269
connections set up in a in a quantum

1366
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:48,430
network so sooner or later you're gonna

1367
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:51,339
have to set up a connection from from

1368
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:53,348
between a pair so I've marked s and D on

1369
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:54,910
here but that's really rather than

1370
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:57,339
source and destination it's really sort

1371
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:59,348
of initiator and responder in terms of

1372
00:58:57,339 --> 00:59:03,849
setting things up because we are talking

1373
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:07,089
about a entanglement as a service rather

1374
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:08,410
than a transmission as a service if you

1375
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:11,288
want to go into some of the details of

1376
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:15,578
this the slide set from from Prague is a

1377
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:16,930
little bit longer let's see so there are

1378
00:59:15,579 --> 00:59:18,729
sort of four stages of the overall

1379
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:21,249
problem one of course is at first of

1380
00:59:18,729 --> 00:59:23,769
course you have to select a path or a

1381
00:59:21,249 --> 00:59:26,799
route through your network you have to

1382
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:28,930
collect a set of information for

1383
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:30,640
planning the set of operations that

1384
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:32,589
you're going to actually execute at each

1385
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,180
of these nodes in the middle and this

1386
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:35,400
again do

1387
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:37,589
it's sort of the the distributed

1388
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,000
computation part of it then you have to

1389
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:40,770
actually do the planning of this

1390
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,050
operation and then you have to convey

1391
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:46,319
the sequence to the to these notes and

1392
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:48,599
all of this is done in the set of

1393
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:51,058
constraints or assumptions the links are

1394
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:54,569
heterogeneous and that not very much is

1395
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:56,460
known about the links a priori and at

1396
00:59:54,569 --> 00:59:58,349
the moment resource management or

1397
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,520
multiplexing is beyond the scope but

1398
00:59:58,349 --> 01:00:03,000
that's something we probably need to

1399
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,579
discuss and so this this draft is aimed

1400
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,349
at the collection and distribution of

1401
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:08,760
this information rather than the process

1402
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,470
of actually planning the sequence of

1403
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:12,000
operations itself and does not

1404
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:15,509
specifically target it at the routing

1405
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,220
itself so each of the nodes has some

1406
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:18,690
information about its own capabilities

1407
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,939
including the amount of memory that it

1408
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:23,130
has and the memory lifetime and its own

1409
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,660
local Fidelity's it has a little bit of

1410
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:29,099
information about the links and those

1411
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:32,520
who its neighbors are and as in OSPF or

1412
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:33,960
a similar protocol we're assuming that

1413
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,400
it knows something about the topology of

1414
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,720
the local network with some sort of

1415
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,640
routing metric and where the gateway to

1416
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,680
the outside world is but not a lot of

1417
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,690
detail about the other things so for

1418
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:45,960
example it does not have full

1419
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:48,299
information about every single memory

1420
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:51,299
qubit everywhere in the network we don't

1421
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:53,040
think that that would scale um so the

1422
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:55,829
basic process is if you picked a path

1423
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:58,410
from the initiator to the responder so

1424
01:00:55,829 --> 01:01:02,040
at each of these nodes you send a Matt a

1425
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:05,368
message across the path sort of building

1426
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:08,308
a stack of information about the the

1427
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:10,920
total set of resources that you're

1428
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:12,930
actually going to be using and then that

1429
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:16,770
runs from the source and through the

1430
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:19,618
nodes abcdefgh I once that arrives at I

1431
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:21,780
I turns around and sends that

1432
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:23,640
information and performs the actual

1433
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:27,089
planning of the entire computation and

1434
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:29,129
it creates a stack of operations to be

1435
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:31,890
executed in each of these notes labeled

1436
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:34,170
with the the node for it and that entire

1437
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:36,270
stack is then sent backwards through the

1438
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:39,390
network and each node progressively pops

1439
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:42,599
its own set of instructions off of the

1440
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:44,730
top of it so it passes through D to C to

1441
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:46,050
B to a and each one collectively gets

1442
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,220
what it needs

1443
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:49,980
this once you have that you have

1444
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:51,390
distributed the set of rules for which

1445
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,380
each node is actually going to operate

1446
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:57,089
and during the course of this connection

1447
01:01:54,380 --> 01:02:00,000
let's see so there's a different diagram

1448
01:01:57,090 --> 01:02:03,900
of what we're looking at there and some

1449
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,250
of the distinctions that you have to

1450
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,680
worry about is you have to figure out

1451
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:09,660
where you are going to perform the

1452
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,839
entanglement swapping operations that

1453
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:14,790
what that got mentioned earlier which

1454
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,070
order you're going to do things in are

1455
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:19,410
you going to apply some sort of error

1456
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:21,870
management scheme which qubits you're

1457
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:24,480
going to use if there are a long wait

1458
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:26,390
intervals how long a wait interval is to

1459
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,740
high and at which point you discard the

1460
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:30,299
states you've been working on reset and

1461
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,100
go back to the beginning those sorts of

1462
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,410
issues are the kinds of things that get

1463
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,420
established in these sets of rules the

1464
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:38,100
details of those particular operations

1465
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,690
are out of the outside of the scope of

1466
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,580
the particular graph we've written all

1467
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,960
we've written so far is the messaging

1468
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:46,170
for how this process actually goes back

1469
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,960
and forth let's see so that's a list of

1470
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:52,320
the a couple of the challenges there

1471
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:55,260
so first draft of this the zero zero

1472
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,610
draft was just before the prog and we

1473
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,830
got some questions on the mailing list

1474
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:02,580
around that point someone brought up the

1475
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:05,790
the suggestion of segment routing as an

1476
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:07,590
alternative this or similar thing I'm

1477
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:09,509
not particularly familiar with segment

1478
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:10,980
routing so if there's anybody who wants

1479
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:14,190
to continue and wants to bring this up

1480
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:18,990
and discuss it more by all means let me

1481
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:20,280
know dieppe not me but they have a

1482
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:23,189
couple of colleagues that are working

1483
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:28,020
very heavily on that I will ask them ok

1484
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:31,980
I myself an expert there but think I can

1485
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:34,080
gather a couple of them ok let's see so

1486
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:38,730
and just before the deadline for this

1487
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:41,100
meeting I put up the o1 draft the only

1488
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:43,500
change is that from the 0 0 draft to the

1489
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:45,420
old one graph were really a fairly minor

1490
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,760
improved the definitions of end nodes

1491
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,320
and repeaters but those really need to

1492
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,850
be coordinate or reconciled with

1493
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,480
actually what's going into a white X

1494
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:57,710
draft we improved the discussion of non

1495
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,950
data teleportation uses of entanglement

1496
01:03:57,710 --> 01:04:01,600
teleportation is the equivalent of

1497
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:04,240
except it's done in a very distributed

1498
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,560
fashion but there are other uses of the

1499
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,720
entanglement as well so there's a little

1500
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:10,330
bit more discussion of that in the in

1501
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:12,220
there and a little bit of a discussion

1502
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:14,200
of multiplexing and resource management

1503
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:16,120
there's nothing prescriptive yet but

1504
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,520
just sort of a description of the need

1505
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,440
for it I really kind of wanted to avoid

1506
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:22,840
putting that into this draft because I

1507
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:24,850
think it's a really a very big issue and

1508
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,650
so I think it belongs um sort of

1509
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:31,600
elsewhere or at least as a as a

1510
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:34,810
follow-on work out of Giga Java I think

1511
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:37,870
it's a someone that's again a number is

1512
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:40,750
that number nine seven six four eight

1513
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:45,609
nine three five two at Hulet conf

1514
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:47,680
attacker.com okay and says I don't think

1515
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:49,090
segment routing is applicable we'll send

1516
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:52,330
an email to the mailing list with

1517
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:53,680
details okay thank you and a couple of

1518
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:55,270
people in the audience who have been

1519
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,040
making faces about it as well it's not

1520
01:04:55,270 --> 01:05:02,530
that it's not a universally approved

1521
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:05,680
solution apparently let's see no I was

1522
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:07,480
Bruno okay yeah yes Bruno has been very

1523
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,259
active and involved on the list on a lot

1524
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:13,240
of these discussions so following on

1525
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:14,710
from that from the posting of the o1

1526
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,020
document and actually some of the stuff

1527
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,370
even going back farther I spent some

1528
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:21,330
time digging through the mailing lists

1529
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:24,460
to see what issues are still open

1530
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:26,799
probably the single biggest issue is

1531
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:28,660
actually the question of creating what's

1532
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,980
called multi-part tied entanglements so

1533
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:32,770
we've been talking so far about

1534
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:36,070
entangling two things in across the

1535
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:37,360
network and a service is to your

1536
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,770
point-to-point entanglement which you

1537
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,440
would use for quantum key distribution

1538
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:43,180
or for sensor networks or distributed

1539
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,340
quantum computing or whatever but it's

1540
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,020
also possible to actually entangle more

1541
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,960
than two sites or more than two devices

1542
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:52,090
and that's actually there are a number

1543
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,430
of uses that have been proposed for that

1544
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:56,560
and so it was brought up on the mailing

1545
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,359
list as to whether or not this

1546
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,820
particular graft addresses that and

1547
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:03,520
whether or not it should my own

1548
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:05,260
preference is that yes we should

1549
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,280
eventually address that issue but we

1550
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,540
should not do it in this particular

1551
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,490
graft I think we should do

1552
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:10,810
point-to-point first so that we have

1553
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,370
some understanding of what we're doing

1554
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,750
before we try to add that additional

1555
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:15,940
complexity

1556
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:17,619
we're also I think much farther away

1557
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:19,900
from actually needing that in the field

1558
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:21,609
and so of course I want the architecture

1559
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,760
to support it but I don't think we need

1560
01:06:21,609 --> 01:06:25,810
to actually address that right now

1561
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,700
someone brought up the notion of a

1562
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,320
kicking context and connection tear down

1563
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,669
which I realized while digging back

1564
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,170
through the through the mailing list and

1565
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:35,190
that's a good point I wrote I wrote a UH

1566
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:37,030
a draft on how you on how you create

1567
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:38,800
connections but not how you tear them

1568
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:40,619
down and presumably you'll want to tear

1569
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,119
them down at some point

1570
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:44,859
Wojtek suggested moving from the

1571
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,720
terminology that we used for the rules

1572
01:06:44,859 --> 01:06:49,029
themselves of being conditioned in

1573
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,848
action to being match in action that

1574
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,830
would be okay by me there was also the

1575
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:56,050
suggestion of separating the rule set

1576
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:58,750
definition from the distribution and I

1577
01:06:56,050 --> 01:07:00,970
do want this draft to focus only on the

1578
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:02,740
distribution and not so much on the

1579
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:04,330
rules themselves but there is in fact a

1580
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:07,359
little bit of discussion of that inside

1581
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:08,950
so we can go into some of the detail on

1582
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,180
the on the mailing list about what

1583
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:12,700
should stay in and what should come out

1584
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:15,569
as a result of that yes just the div

1585
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:18,129
around just a quick comment on tear down

1586
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:20,650
if you'd have to have a justification

1587
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:24,250
pretty strong for needing it because you

1588
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:25,839
can just do soft state timeout and that

1589
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:28,240
has very nice properties because it

1590
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,400
doesn't it it it recovers nicely if

1591
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,229
there's a network partition you don't

1592
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,060
have to sort of remember stayed during a

1593
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:35,680
disconnection to reconnect and only to

1594
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:38,259
be able to tear things down and throw a

1595
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,000
state away so I would say start with the

1596
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:42,369
notion that the these connections are

1597
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,619
soft state timeout and just get

1598
01:07:42,369 --> 01:07:48,280
refreshed or on a timer in order to keep

1599
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:49,960
them going and unless there's some

1600
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,960
strong reason why you really need to

1601
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:56,170
recover resources deterministically with

1602
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:57,369
a with a explicit teardown that's a good

1603
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,599
thought you know that the set of

1604
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,460
resources that are going to be available

1605
01:07:58,599 --> 01:08:03,130
in any network in the short term is a

1606
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:05,380
very limited set of resources and so

1607
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,820
potentially we may want to recover that

1608
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,910
or include it in some sort of resource

1609
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,050
management scheme but personally I sort

1610
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:14,170
of agree with you I would sort of leave

1611
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:15,849
it for sort of soft timeout but at least

1612
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:17,410
incorporating that into the draft in

1613
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:20,500
some way as this is what's expected to

1614
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:22,389
happen I think would be a good idea

1615
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:25,720
the other big issue was whether this is

1616
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:28,000
single domain or Internet work and the

1617
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:31,480
draft as written is for a single network

1618
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,180
my own proposed approach to the overall

1619
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:36,608
inter network architecture is to build

1620
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:38,440
off of the recursive network

1621
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:42,310
architecture which Joe touch and others

1622
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:44,169
defined quite a while back for classical

1623
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:45,700
networks but it is not not sort of

1624
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:47,740
widely adopted at this point but I think

1625
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:50,080
it actually suits quantum networks very

1626
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:52,089
very well so we have one old paper from

1627
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:55,210
about 10 years ago on that working on

1628
01:08:52,089 --> 01:08:57,370
that let's see and so those are sort of

1629
01:08:55,210 --> 01:09:00,000
the the issues of what we're planning on

1630
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:06,210
doing for that and that's it for my

1631
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:08,410
draft any any further questions comments

1632
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:13,210
how many people have actually looked at

1633
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:14,680
this draft Oh 10 or 12 here in the room

1634
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:17,290
that's pretty good that that's good

1635
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,060
thank you all for doing that all right

1636
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:21,069
if there's nothing else then we'll go on

1637
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:24,279
to the next scheduled presentation which

1638
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:25,299
is on the integration of OpenSSL in this

1639
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:26,799
hangout all right question something

1640
01:09:25,299 --> 01:09:31,839
from Java yes

1641
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:34,479
Fredrik for the regular science I feared

1642
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:36,640
that focusing on point upon links now

1643
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:38,709
instead of considering multi-party

1644
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:41,319
entanglement for the stat will freeze

1645
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:45,279
some assumptions well I'm sorry well

1646
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:55,480
what some assumptions will freeze will

1647
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:59,550
freeze would or badly okay point taken

1648
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:02,410
I'm not sure I agree with the the I

1649
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:04,390
would certainly say that the multi-part

1650
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:07,150
ID is a substantial more complex problem

1651
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:09,520
and I want to keep things as simple as

1652
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:12,129
possible and add complexity only when it

1653
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,410
starts to become necessary so that issue

1654
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:15,670
is actually entangled with a different

1655
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:17,950
issue which is you're also assuming

1656
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,580
congruence between the classical and the

1657
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:23,080
quantum channels as opposed to

1658
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:25,030
independent topologies for the classical

1659
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:27,340
channels and the and the quantum

1660
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:30,030
channels so that you know for example

1661
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:33,100
you can't you don't have a way to

1662
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:33,780
optimally use a broadcast classical

1663
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,510
channel

1664
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:43,259
in order to manage a set of

1665
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:45,900
point-to-point quantum channels I mean

1666
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,340
one could design protocols that worked

1667
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,170
where there wasn't congruence between

1668
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,540
the classical channel and the quantum

1669
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:53,580
Channel I think that it is probably an

1670
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,340
interaction between that and whether you

1671
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:58,080
want to do multi-part tight

1672
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:59,730
entanglements I'm not sure there's

1673
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,980
actually a direct relationship there I

1674
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:03,389
do think you're correct that so far we

1675
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:05,059
have not assumed to the existence of

1676
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:06,810
that classical broadcast channel

1677
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:08,040
although I don't think anybody's

1678
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,600
actually written that assumption down

1679
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,280
and I would like to keep that assumption

1680
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,280
I do not want to assume a classical

1681
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:16,620
broadcast channel we do assume this I

1682
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,780
used what cast as like the that's the

1683
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:20,610
other extreme right of completely

1684
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,500
congruent one classical channel for

1685
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:26,000
quantum Channel but there many

1686
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:28,410
intermediary possible deployments right

1687
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,910
yeah I would say yeah I'm fine with

1688
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:36,960
keeping the congruence for now right we

1689
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:38,130
do we do have to have quantum

1690
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,590
communicator or a classical

1691
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:42,420
communication between all of the the

1692
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:45,210
classical controllers for each of the

1693
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:48,480
quantum nodes along along the path but

1694
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:50,070
there may be boundaries beyond which the

1695
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,919
communication between these two nodes

1696
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:55,049
never never crosses a / to a network

1697
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,720
boundary or even the existence of nodes

1698
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:59,340
within a particular network may not even

1699
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,930
necessarily be exposed outside the

1700
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:03,330
network boundary that's one of the

1701
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:06,210
issues we've worked on with the larger

1702
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:07,740
recursive network architecture but for

1703
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:09,930
this particular draft we're assuming a

1704
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:11,400
single and individual network and that

1705
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:12,810
all of the all of the classical and

1706
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,230
control nodes can communicate with each

1707
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:20,160
other as necessary yes jabber language

1708
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:22,950
when do decide but sofa Bruno

1709
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:25,260
saying that he says I see strong

1710
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:29,580
resemblance between this protocol and

1711
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:33,480
RSVP RSVP has point-to-multipoint LSPs

1712
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:37,500
which which are similar to multi port

1713
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:39,690
items on government and Fredrik saying I

1714
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,160
think like Bruno that the adaptation to

1715
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:45,639
some multi-part identical meant

1716
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:48,200
distribution is not too complex okay

1717
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,580
Bob Braden was I used to have an office

1718
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,769
next to Bob great and he was one of the

1719
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:55,130
sweetest humans on the planet so I I

1720
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:57,400
like RSVP but all right let's go into

1721
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:57,400
the next

1722
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:35,900
is this a very big file 250 kilobytes

1723
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,960
turn 50 kilobytes it should have been

1724
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:48,710
there all right there we go

1725
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:51,500
all right okay so right so I'm going to

1726
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:54,470
talk a bit about integrating qkd in to

1727
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:59,200
openness cell where does this come from

1728
01:13:54,470 --> 01:14:02,870
so on November 5th and 6th right labs

1729
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:07,309
ripe ncc organized a pan-european

1730
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:11,300
quantum internet hackathon where

1731
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:14,540
multiple nodes participated Delft Paris

1732
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:17,330
Sarajevo Padova Geneva Dublin in Geneva

1733
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:18,620
was actually CERN and the idea was to

1734
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:21,290
tackle various quantum internet

1735
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:23,690
challenges and I was one of the

1736
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:25,730
technical coordinators and one of the

1737
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:28,219
challenges I proposed for the hackers

1738
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:33,139
and I was actually integrating qkt into

1739
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:34,520
open SSL so if you actually want to look

1740
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:36,380
up what the challenge was afterwards

1741
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,540
it's actually all on github publicly

1742
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,250
available and but essentially what I was

1743
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,800
trying to go over and kind of lay down

1744
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:45,290
in front of the hackers was that having

1745
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,080
an end goal was to basically open up a

1746
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:50,480
browser on one computer and run a server

1747
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:53,809
running some basic website on another

1748
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:56,740
computer and actually have an HTTP

1749
01:14:53,810 --> 01:15:00,680
connection which was encrypted using qkd

1750
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:02,440
all over a simulated network and they

1751
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:05,840
wouldn't really give us the real network

1752
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,820
once they built in but what was the

1753
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,270
motivation for the challenge and so my

1754
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:13,040
it's kind of like my personal Eric with

1755
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:15,770
the way the state of quantum networking

1756
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,080
is today it's basically we either talk

1757
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:19,910
at a very low hardware level low level

1758
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:23,769
operations like entanglements while

1759
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:26,930
being linked entanglement generation

1760
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:28,730
gates it's very very very low level and

1761
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:30,230
then we also have the other extreme

1762
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:31,969
where we're talking about application

1763
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,559
protocols but they all like quantum

1764
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,640
cryptography

1765
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,460
protocols with really complex

1766
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:38,470
mathematical proofs and I with a physics

1767
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,610
degree I struggle to follow them and to

1768
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:41,890
be honest I just give up most of the

1769
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:44,049
time anyway and it's not my area of

1770
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:45,250
expertise so I kind of wanted to bring

1771
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:46,840
one when I was to a user level

1772
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,130
application kind of raised the level of

1773
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:50,200
abstraction and led people to actually

1774
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:52,240
hack at a higher level then just you

1775
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,910
know stringing together gates like you

1776
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:56,110
do in kiss gate or QED sharp etc I kind

1777
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:57,849
of open up the field to software

1778
01:15:56,110 --> 01:16:02,019
engineers who don't necessarily have a

1779
01:15:57,850 --> 01:16:03,130
condo physics background because I spent

1780
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,200
two years as actually as a software

1781
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:07,450
engineer in a company that was doing

1782
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,519
control plane protocols and at that time

1783
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:10,720
I kind of completely stopped thinking

1784
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,740
about physics and kind of learn the

1785
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,910
software engine is actually a very

1786
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:15,099
creative bunch and they're much better

1787
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:17,620
at coming up with like practical uses of

1788
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:19,690
various abstractions and stringing them

1789
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:21,220
together into something more powerful so

1790
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:23,200
that's kind of what I wanted to open it

1791
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:25,600
up to do and also just practically

1792
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,160
relate the hackathon to I'm going to qkd

1793
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,110
because qkd is actually a commercialized

1794
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:31,090
technology already exists and people

1795
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:32,799
actually do sell devices and make money

1796
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:34,600
well whether they make profit is a

1797
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:38,200
different question I have no idea but

1798
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:41,560
they are being sold so the challenge was

1799
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:42,730
built around an API that Etsy a European

1800
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,960
standards organization is trying to

1801
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,790
standardize I don't think it's

1802
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,800
standardized yet but they're working on

1803
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:49,960
it I have a bunch of documents about it

1804
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:53,380
and and it seems they're in a quite an

1805
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:54,430
advanced stage the API is very simple it

1806
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:56,860
has five functions but they're really

1807
01:16:54,430 --> 01:17:00,430
for basically you open a connection you

1808
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:02,620
well you open your connection to your

1809
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:04,870
qkt device you connect to the other qkd

1810
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:06,670
device you get your key or you and then

1811
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:09,420
you close what does the flow roughly

1812
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:12,940
look like the flow looks like basically

1813
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:14,140
on your server and the client you

1814
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:18,460
basically you open your connection to

1815
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:20,590
your qkt device through your qkd api you

1816
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:22,480
use a key handle to essentially identify

1817
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,980
the session at the two ends the key

1818
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,320
handle can be sent in the open to the

1819
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:28,540
other end it's not just an identifier

1820
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,070
between the two endpoints there's also a

1821
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,240
version where you can pre distribute the

1822
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:34,170
key handle and you don't actually have

1823
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:36,010
to send it between the two ends you

1824
01:17:34,170 --> 01:17:38,890
initiate a connection between the two

1825
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:40,270
ends and then you run a get key again

1826
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:42,940
and again and then you close it now

1827
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:43,990
that's roughly the API and what were

1828
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:45,519
they elements of the challenge there are

1829
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,480
basically two parts one was to actually

1830
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,410
integrate

1831
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:52,419
this API was OpenSSL and and the other

1832
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:53,920
was to actually implement the qkd api in

1833
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:55,330
software and so basically there are

1834
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,860
people who actually understood the

1835
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,450
physics and wanted to implement a qkd

1836
01:17:56,860 --> 01:18:01,330
protocol could do so and basically

1837
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:02,950
provide that API or people who wanted to

1838
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:04,570
just have an abstract API and actually

1839
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:07,269
do hacking on an open source repository

1840
01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:08,380
of open SSL it could do that and then

1841
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:11,980
the first part is the one I'm going to

1842
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:13,210
focus on and talk about here so there

1843
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:15,730
was actually a team and Delft that

1844
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:20,050
attempted to integrate this qkd API into

1845
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:21,429
open SSL Composer Bruno Evo and Tim and

1846
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:23,800
Bruno actually has a very thorough

1847
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:25,570
write-up and if you follow this thing

1848
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:27,160
it's very thorough it has a lot of

1849
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:31,360
background information about like

1850
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:33,099
encryption by the SSL and why quantum

1851
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:34,599
key distribution and so on it's actually

1852
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:36,340
it's not just about the projects also a

1853
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,470
very thorough background explanation so

1854
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:39,850
I do recommend visiting it it also has

1855
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:43,570
running code if you would actually want

1856
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:46,170
to try out and saying roughly there are

1857
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:49,540
two ways of extending open SSL and

1858
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:51,190
basically open a Cell provides an NG

1859
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:54,220
provides a way of extending open cell

1860
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:56,980
using what they call engines and they're

1861
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:58,930
basically a way for openness cell to

1862
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:00,690
offload some of the heavier

1863
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:03,340
computational functions onto Hardware

1864
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:07,450
normally and so if you have like

1865
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:08,500
diffie-hellman key a protocol you can

1866
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:09,730
actually offload some of the more

1867
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,560
computationally intensive stuff onto

1868
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:13,450
hardware that's what an engine is for

1869
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:15,610
you basically provide callbacks for the

1870
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,830
sink sweden hardware or you create a

1871
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:20,380
first-class key exchange protocol state

1872
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:21,550
machine the other one would record the

1873
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:23,020
first one doesn't actually require you

1874
01:19:21,550 --> 01:19:24,910
to change anything in the open a cell

1875
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:26,110
code base the second one does actually

1876
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:28,840
require you to change the open a cell

1877
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:31,089
code base the team opted to go for to

1878
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,800
implement an engine they abused the

1879
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:34,060
diffie-hellman protocol so basically

1880
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,690
open a self but it was running

1881
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,760
diffie-hellman

1882
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:41,320
but really the callbacks were just doing

1883
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:45,690
qkd and what does their architecture if

1884
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:48,130
they look like so we provided a mock api

1885
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:50,469
in order to let one of the teams

1886
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:52,660
actually implemented an edition of the

1887
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:55,090
api so actually the hackathon they just

1888
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:57,430
had a mock which just didn't do anything

1889
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:59,920
quantum I just provided the API in a

1890
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:03,250
mock way and then basically they

1891
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:05,320
an engine difficult and benjin built on

1892
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:06,610
top of their security API that would

1893
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,170
actually communicate with the openness

1894
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:09,849
the library so we're just a call back to

1895
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:14,560
the OpenSSL library and the OpenSSL

1896
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:16,570
library would therefore do qkd thinking

1897
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:19,060
I was doing diffie-hellman difficulty

1898
01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:20,710
and challenges and there's some the

1899
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:22,989
engine actually behaved differently on

1900
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:24,429
the server the client side but the

1901
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:26,799
callbacks were actually symmetrical and

1902
01:20:24,429 --> 01:20:28,330
opened a cell and so that kind of was a

1903
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:30,820
challenge in the end the team actually

1904
01:20:28,330 --> 01:20:34,410
implemented two different binaries two

1905
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:37,660
different openness silk libraries and

1906
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:39,040
also the design of the mock API was

1907
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,739
actually pretty limited because it was

1908
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,790
actually meant to be just be simple and

1909
01:20:40,739 --> 01:20:45,280
so that we didn't have to spend too much

1910
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:46,840
time implementing a mock API and but it

1911
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,360
turned out and actually the design led

1912
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:50,590
to deadlocks and you wouldn't use the

1913
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,299
engines because of the way the state

1914
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:57,520
machine worked so they actually had to

1915
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:58,719
hack on the mock API as well and in the

1916
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,500
end they did there's actually running

1917
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,610
code on this github link and the

1918
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,679
conclusion is open ourselves actually

1919
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:07,630
quite difficult to extend and even the

1920
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,250
easy hacky way of doing it and actually

1921
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:11,110
something I didn't put in is like I

1922
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:14,800
found this project quite cold I saw a

1923
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:16,509
team working on it because we've done a

1924
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,520
few of these hackathons already and very

1925
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:20,020
often people without a quantum

1926
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,520
background would spend a day or two just

1927
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:23,410
learning about quantum how do you

1928
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,880
combine gates what do they do it cetera

1929
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:26,349
where I said this will make actually

1930
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,600
could like really get on it actually

1931
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:33,330
implement an application and into an

1932
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,330
application so I found that quite fun

1933
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:43,690
okay am i speaking so actually I used to

1934
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:48,129
work on similar projects ten years ago

1935
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:49,900
my target was i ke so and I'm asking a

1936
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:52,929
question so do not showing a favor of

1937
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:58,150
qkg so you know the qkd come and they

1938
01:21:52,929 --> 01:22:01,270
fail i do to restore ping then we isn't

1939
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:04,870
you need some kind of a fallback or oh

1940
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:07,390
so oh yes so the fallback em so the way

1941
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:10,469
the api was designed actually i actually

1942
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:12,790
should have put a picture is was that

1943
01:22:10,469 --> 01:22:13,820
basically all the complicated stuff

1944
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:18,769
about qkd

1945
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:20,150
was the below the API so essentially you

1946
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:22,099
had the whole system connected to each

1947
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:23,929
other it did all the post-processing all

1948
01:22:22,099 --> 01:22:25,460
the all the difficult stuff was done

1949
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:26,989
below the API none of the difficult

1950
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:28,969
stuff was expected to be done above the

1951
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:30,468
API but no we didn't have any so I

1952
01:22:28,969 --> 01:22:32,690
actually don't even know what the API

1953
01:22:30,469 --> 01:22:35,630
specifies it does if it can't get a key

1954
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:44,000
I think it just blocks I guess so now we

1955
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:48,739
didn't have a fallback a couple of

1956
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:51,469
commands one from let me recall I think

1957
01:22:48,739 --> 01:22:55,280
is a Bruno yes

1958
01:22:51,469 --> 01:22:58,699
Bruno's I'm working on an implementation

1959
01:22:55,280 --> 01:23:01,849
of VB 84 in Python using the simulacrum

1960
01:22:58,699 --> 01:23:03,949
simulator the quantum part is done but

1961
01:23:01,849 --> 01:23:05,630
I'm still working on the classical

1962
01:23:03,949 --> 01:23:07,759
post-processing information

1963
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:10,010
reconciliation and privacy amplification

1964
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,770
once the Python implementation is done I

1965
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:15,139
will translate it to C and integrate it

1966
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:17,750
with open SSL work down at the hackathon

1967
01:23:15,139 --> 01:23:20,630
I expect this work to be completed

1968
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:25,250
within a few week weeks at most

1969
01:23:20,630 --> 01:23:28,699
everything will be posted on github no

1970
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:31,369
no no yes oh yeah Bruno is the guy who

1971
01:23:28,699 --> 01:23:33,860
actually led the team so he implemented

1972
01:23:31,369 --> 01:23:35,449
this hacker and stuff so yeah do follow

1973
01:23:33,860 --> 01:23:37,309
it yeah I still do strongly recommend

1974
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:38,598
visiting that website his write-up is

1975
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:40,429
actually very good if you're interested

1976
01:23:38,599 --> 01:23:43,429
in this project okay let's make this

1977
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:44,960
let's wind this up quickly because we've

1978
01:23:43,429 --> 01:23:48,790
already burned almost all of our open

1979
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:52,010
mic time and I want to get somehow

1980
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:54,860
anyway yes well Bruno's opinion is

1981
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:59,210
important cuz he's a guy who didn't know

1982
01:23:54,860 --> 01:24:01,130
is my question precisely when it comes

1983
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:04,489
to the fallback and all the like is

1984
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:08,210
about identifying a set of proper proper

1985
01:24:04,489 --> 01:24:09,980
ciphers which to be used in TLS to with

1986
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:12,619
open SSL this is something you have not

1987
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:15,379
done yet right or not that I'm aware of

1988
01:24:12,619 --> 01:24:17,960
no probably would be once we have this

1989
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:19,969
or you have this more or less stable it

1990
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:21,679
will be interesting to discuss about the

1991
01:24:19,969 --> 01:24:26,150
cipher suites and even trying to to

1992
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:27,620
standardize and why not well again new

1993
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:30,049
Tomoya here so I didn't

1994
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:31,370
the employer that I worked for before so

1995
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:35,570
I work for the German Aerospace Center

1996
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:37,970
and first of all thank you a lot for

1997
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:42,259
bringing the subject up for a very first

1998
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:44,150
ITF that attend here so in 2013 we got a

1999
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:47,480
nature in a science article for already

2000
01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:49,670
trying to run a BB 84 protocol and

2001
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:52,209
synchronized with a plane so plane

2002
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:56,360
flying did the key exchange and the data

2003
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:57,980
encryption everything done so this is

2004
01:24:56,360 --> 01:25:00,170
something that we're very much looking

2005
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:01,910
forward to coming out you know because

2006
01:25:00,170 --> 01:25:04,940
I'm this a huge project in Europe going

2007
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:08,000
on called the qci quantum communication

2008
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:09,440
infrastructure that's based on the qnet

2009
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,510
project and I'm pretty sure you're also

2010
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:14,299
aware of the media satellite project

2011
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:16,310
running by the Chinese run by the

2012
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,800
Chinese so I think this is a very

2013
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:20,300
important topic and I think next time

2014
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:23,480
I'm gonna be here with ten more of my

2015
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:24,250
colleagues hopefully working on that so

2016
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,259
thank you a lot

2017
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:28,970
sounds cool that's exciting alright

2018
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,970
we've got five minutes phone phone for

2019
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:33,800
for open mic out of the 20 I'd hoped it

2020
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:38,210
to have but I think all of this has been

2021
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:40,520
valuable so far questions anything

2022
01:25:38,210 --> 01:25:42,320
related to the working group at all or a

2023
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:45,490
device on running the the working group

2024
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,490
or advice on where we should go next

2025
01:25:56,710 --> 01:26:16,520
someone should have something yeah sorry

2026
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:19,190
for kind of hogging the mic so I do it I

2027
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,630
only have one thing to say a topic

2028
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:22,178
another time so one of the topics that

2029
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:23,929
reoccurs in the mailing list is

2030
01:26:22,179 --> 01:26:26,179
multi-part of entanglement but there's

2031
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:29,570
also one more topic that pops up every

2032
01:26:26,179 --> 01:26:31,910
now and again on my mailing list which

2033
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:33,889
is the relation between the way we do

2034
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:36,110
quantum networks and MPLS or more

2035
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:38,090
specifically gmpls there's already work

2036
01:26:36,110 --> 01:26:39,349
actually done that qk d ng MPLS so

2037
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:43,610
there's actually even a publication I

2038
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:44,690
think you worked on that and so there's

2039
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:46,339
actually already work on that and I

2040
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:48,049
think you'll be I know one of their an

2041
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:50,150
interesting question actually to tackle

2042
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:53,890
as well and Kure G given that there will

2043
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:57,379
be MPLS and gmpls experts in the ITF and

2044
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:58,850
so I think that's actually and actually

2045
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:00,469
Bruno has also committed to work on

2046
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:02,870
actually adding an MPLS section to the

2047
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:05,390
architecture draft and so there's

2048
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:06,559
definitely scope for a lot of questions

2049
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:08,719
and how do you do these things what are

2050
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:15,800
the similarities what can we piggyback

2051
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:17,239
on etc other comments or questions one

2052
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:21,500
in particular I want to bring up before

2053
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:23,629
we sort of finish here on the proposal

2054
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:28,070
that's on the table is to push this from

2055
01:27:23,630 --> 01:27:30,920
proposed RG to full RG as of after

2056
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:33,019
Vancouver which is the next IETF we have

2057
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:37,460
not yet committed to actually doing a Qi

2058
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:39,320
RG meeting like this in Vancouver yet

2059
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:40,730
but but it's very likely to happen and I

2060
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:44,660
almost certainly will be there in person

2061
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:49,730
any any comments or questions on on

2062
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:52,330
Vancouver or becoming a full RG people

2063
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:52,330
in favor of that

2064
01:27:54,550 --> 01:28:04,900
other comments or questions ya wanna hum

2065
01:28:03,489 --> 01:28:07,030
for whether or not we should push for

2066
01:28:04,900 --> 01:28:10,388
full large e okay everybody who's in

2067
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:14,040
favor of pushing for full RG as soon as

2068
01:28:10,389 --> 01:28:14,040
sort of feasible let's let's hop

2069
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:21,610
sounds like consensus to me anyone

2070
01:28:19,059 --> 01:28:27,909
opposed to to moving toward full RG for

2071
01:28:21,610 --> 01:28:31,079
this um sounds like consensus to me any

2072
01:28:27,909 --> 01:28:31,079
other questions comments

2073
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:41,559
if not we'll end up about 90 seconds

2074
01:28:38,469 --> 01:28:47,320
early here see you all at the social in

2075
01:28:41,559 --> 01:28:49,510
door at the plenary tomorrow blue sheets

2076
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:51,579
anyone who did not sign the blue sheets

2077
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:55,679
please do so before you go out and

2078
01:28:51,579 --> 01:28:55,679
please bring me the blue sheets

2079
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:04,189
