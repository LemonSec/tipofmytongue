00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,400
a note-taker he jumped on jabber scribe

17
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,500
so we wouldn't ask him to be a

18
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:08,960
note-taker all right we do we have a

19

note-taker notetaker wonder if I can get

21
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,510
the Hank to do it since he's uh appears

22
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:32,450
to be too distracted to say now

23
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:40,789
note-taker you have to it okay

24
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:40,789
note-taker anyone anyone really people

25
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,620
way I could do that but I'm looking at

26
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,940
the room and I'm sensing that that might

27
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,940
mean we just don't have the meeting

28
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,710
Chris you're gonna take notes yep so I

29
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,000
guess one of our chairs has generously

30
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,570
agreed to take notes and I will note

31
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,580
that that is not me so apologies for

32
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,000
getting started late note to self

33
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:37,270
kick the side meeting out in a timely

34
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:40,270
manner loose sheet going around now okay

35
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,439
I do believe we are now ready to get

36
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,699
started

37
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,980
apologies for the delay this is the

38
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,290
second working group in the IHF we have

39
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,610
a jabber scribe and we have a note-taker

40
00:08:50,290 --> 00:09:01,750
and the blue sheets are about to begin

41
00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:03,250
so this is the note well when you

42
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,870
register for the meeting you will have

43
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,640
agreed to this this is a reminder that

44
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:11,050
these conditions still apply in this

45
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:15,069
meeting this is the agenda that we have

46
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:20,229
for today we're going to rejigger it

47
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:22,000
slightly to allow a couple folks that

48
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:25,060
need at least one person that needs to

49
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,230
leave to leave so the first thing we're

50
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,719
going to cover real briefly is the

51
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,010
status of the coast word document and

52
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,589
the early document which have both

53
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,750
completed working group last call and

54
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:40,150
then at that point we will proceed with

55
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:45,890
the agenda as it is so any other agenda

56
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:50,220
bashing agenda

57
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,110
and is that an item for the term another

58
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,380
document is it still expired at the

59
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,360
moment it is expired yeah but I keep

60
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,010
putting it on the agenda for an update

61
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,850
so that you will tell us what we're

62
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:04,860
gonna do with it this is called

63
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,800
passive-aggressive pressure no so I

64
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:11,250
can't join this too cheap because then

65
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,870
we are that's not okay we you can you

66
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,460
repeat that please I have to go to cheap

67
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,640
at some point okay so we'll do

68
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,140
terminology third yeah yeah okay thank

69
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,319
you

70
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,910
women today or so perhaps we'll cover

71
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,860
this in working group status way ahead I

72
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,170
would like to bash milestones and verses

73
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,920
documents and yes you are the milestone

74
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,839
ad all right

75
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,449
so Steven do you want to give a really

76
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,520
quick update on really okay so the role

77
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,530
a software descriptor document has gone

78
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,470
through working group last call and has

79
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:49,110
received a decent amount of review and

80
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,330
feedback that feedback has been

81
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,300
integrated into the most recent version

82
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,220
of the document it's been updated and I

83
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,140
believe that the document is now ready

84
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,990
to move forward through the shepherding

85
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:07,500
process if the chairs are ready for that

86
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:09,840
as well I believe we are so great great

87
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,580
okay that's all yeah excellent

88
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,170
thank you so that that document is done

89
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,170
and ready for shepherding coast wood

90
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:32,640
good morning Dave altameyer so we we've

91
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,220
completed it feels like a few working

92
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,290
group last calls on on coast wit at this

93
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,900
point we've gotten a ton of feedback on

94
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,319
the document and that's all been

95
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:47,010
addressed the the most recent feedback

96
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,110
we've gotten was from Kathleen and she

97
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,420
fixed a bunch of typographic or she

98
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,570
pointed out a bunch of typographic

99
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,880
editorial issues that were fixed in the

100
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,800
latest draft that was posted she did

101
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,189
raise a couple of issues

102
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,920
which we've there's been some

103
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:07,410
back-and-forth on the on the list about

104
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,529
I wanted to raise those I'm in the room

105
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:13,850
just just for awareness so the first one

106
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:18,449
was she was suggesting that that we had

107
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:22,739
support for using cosy web tokens as a

108
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:24,660
way to support signing in the coast

109
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:29,100
would draft I suggested that it was

110
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,629
pretty late in in the hour as far as you

111
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,009
know work on the on the draft that we

112
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:36,269
were looking to send it forward I

113
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:38,369
suggested that maybe if there's interest

114
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,850
in pursuing that kind of solution that

115
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:46,499
we look at maybe writing a second draft

116
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:48,449
to describe how one would do that we

117
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:51,420
could do abyss as well

118
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:54,089
I personally like to see you know more

119
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,860
implementers raise their you know their

120
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,100
opinions as far as what kind of

121
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,459
assigning approach that we would like to

122
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:05,610
see in the draft so um hi this is hang

123
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:12,029
from the Mike but it might look very

124
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:14,029
obvious to do that I I'm using CW a lot

125
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,439
for a lot of things and and

126
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:19,290
unfortunately it was not ready at the

127
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:22,230
Palmeri started the reasons why haven't

128
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,149
done that but now it's a small lift

129
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,610
certificate format it's a total format

130
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:29,699
so they're issuers and subjects and

131
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:32,639
issue a date and this is this is

132
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:37,670
redundant semantics to coast with so so

133
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:41,519
I'm I have no way of breaking semantic a

134
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:43,229
strict division of semantics when we

135
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,079
include and we have to include them the

136
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:52,230
optional items that are issue are and

137
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:57,209
other claims from from CWT also we would

138
00:13:52,230 --> 00:14:00,419
swamp the CWT registry with roughly 80

139
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:02,339
to 100 new items and I think that trendy

140
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:05,549
in there right now so we dominate that

141
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:07,589
place suddenly I don't I know it could

142
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:08,100
be done and if there is a good use case

143
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:10,169
for it

144
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,090
I'm all for guiding everybody through

145
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:14,100
the process because I'm

146
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:17,970
I'm not sure it's in the solving an

147
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,650
actual problem right and I think from

148
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,540
that perspective there's a lot to talk

149
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,520
about and something you know that that

150
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,459
conversation is going to take you know a

151
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,439
number of months probably to conclude

152
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:34,320
you know which we'll just further push

153
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:37,080
back the publication of coasted and but

154
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,900
I think I think what I'm proposing as a

155
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,560
way forward maybe is that we you know we

156
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,829
published coast wit as is and and that

157
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,989
if there's interest in and looking at a

158
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,920
CWT based signing solution that we have

159
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,920
that as a separate conversation

160
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,640
Kathleen on the Java has mentioned that

161
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,680
she will help she also mentioned that

162
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,240
she is going to read the really document

163
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,640
from before I miss that comics I was up

164
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:09,450
here talking about it so uh sorry

165
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,430
Kathleen put in chat here potentially

166
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:18,090
removed the method specified and do it

167
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:21,170
in a separate draft I mean given given

168
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,470
that they're given that there are

169
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,420
integrity

170
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:30,330
security considerations you know

171
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:32,939
relating to a coast wid and I I think

172
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:36,390
the the responsible thing is to provide

173
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:40,370
at least a signing solution at least an

174
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:43,380
integrity mechanism as part of the draft

175
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:48,090
to you know to provide for that

176
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:50,490
integrity I think if we were to pull

177
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:55,380
that out we would be providing only a

178
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:57,240
partial solution you know which you know

179
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:01,320
given that there's already interest in

180
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,330
using you know cozy I don't it doesn't

181
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:08,130
seem like we wish we should have to do

182
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:11,730
that at this at this point in time this

183
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:14,610
is Steven as Steven yeah I think I agree

184
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:16,680
with Dave that signing is pretty

185
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:19,590
important I mean if we look at some of

186
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,359
the interest around a Swit itself

187
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,730
signing is a pretty important use case

188
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,810
in a lot of places and it's important to

189
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,900
how people are in

190
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,550
- and are currently using Swit yeah and

191
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,279
I think if you want to fully support

192
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,740
Swit in Khost wid then signing something

193
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,990
that's gonna need to get done and I

194
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,750
mention the kathleen that you know cozy

195
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:44,370
as a as a signing container is is

196
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:47,850
roughly parallel to xml d sake from the

197
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,490
persuade tags it's a similar kind of

198
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:53,510
approach and also we need signing

199
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:56,730
because otherwise we cannot do the

200
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,740
appraisal policy reference value known

201
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:00,990
good value stuff from the servers and

202
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,570
the draft is basically done and we have

203
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:06,150
to do a reference to the RFC

204
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:08,850
and that is very important so if you

205
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,280
can't sign it today and wait for the

206
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:16,800
next iteration a lot of people will be

207
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,660
kind of mad yeah right so I guess we're

208
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:22,800
looking to the chairs as far as guidance

209
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,199
on you know how to how to pursue this so

210
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,990
I feel like if the conversation just

211
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:33,360
happened so managing too many things at

212
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:35,310
once as chair there was a room says we

213
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,250
should figure out how to do signing do

214
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,139
you think we should delay for adding

215
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,380
signing to the draft because that part

216
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:46,100
wasn't exactly clear to me and then

217
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:49,230
humming something like a full Rios cozy

218
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,300
you will there is a there's appendix how

219
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,780
to sign that and about to hit a few to

220
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:57,149
use bear and venden why it is in the box

221
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,879
okay so it wasn't clear to me you wanted

222
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,460
to add another mechanism I think on the

223
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,890
conversation I think it's worth

224
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,870
discussing other mechanisms but I

225
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:15,690
believe that there should probably at it

226
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:24,090
as the editors extensions to well I mean

227
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:25,800
there's this CWT suggestions sure I just

228
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,720
wanted to make sure that Kathleen had a

229
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,050
couple responses and I want to make sure

230
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,179
that her opinion got voiced here as well

231
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,830
she agrees that signing is important but

232
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,220
that multiple methods are confusing

233
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,120
maybe waiting a little bit makes sense

234
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,650
she's worried about adoption

235
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,649
not just getting the draft out the door

236
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,830
yes sorry this is think my last comment

237
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:52,530
was not on the mic

238
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:56,399
CWT uses cozy as dust cold sweat it is

239
00:18:52,530 --> 00:19:00,120
the same method so if we would have a

240
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:05,580
biz or an additional document it would

241
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:09,149
basically say we now use the seven CWT

242
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,750
claims also and I do I think that's the

243
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,960
only difference

244
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,790
NEC Tabuchi res it registry and swamp

245
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,179
that so that basically that is the only

246
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:20,100
addition we would make and I'm not sure

247
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,410
if you're breaking anything before or

248
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,480
after because we will literally use the

249
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,110
same signing mechanism where there's a

250
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,670
cozy envelope both of them use them I

251
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:35,428
think so please collect me if I'm wrong

252
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:38,490
but a British it's also anything because

253
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:39,750
lien wants to do this is other document

254
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,090
we are happy to help with that that is

255
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,370
not a problem I don't think that the

256
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:48,480
signing is breaking it something today

257
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:51,750
because it's the same thing so I think I

258
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,790
understand the you know the room I want

259
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,800
to take it to the list but sounds like

260
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,389
we have nominally a way for it I just

261
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,940
want to have a finish off the discussion

262
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,100
on the list to be sure and if if the

263
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,350
case is that there's general consensus

264
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,370
that the signing that's present now is

265
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,840
sufficient we'll move it forward okay

266
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,639
all right then that sounds good

267
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,209
and then there's there was one other

268
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,640
issue raised by Kathleen's review so

269
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:21,500
currently for identifying hash

270
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:27,120
algorithms we used the name hash

271
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:29,040
algorithms registry in Khost wid she was

272
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,580
suggesting maybe that we align that with

273
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:36,500
the cose algorithms registry which uses

274
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:40,290
a slightly different identifier space

275
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:42,620
for the four similar algorithms I think

276
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:46,200
the challenge that we have is one of

277
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,939
algorithm agility the the nice thing

278
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,040
about using the named hash algorithms

279
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,830
registry is it's it's just hash

280
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,960
algorithms if we were to point to the

281
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:58,470
Cosi algorithms registry we would need

282
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,029
some way of pointing only of selecting

283
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,299
out of that registry only the hash

284
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:04,470
algorithms because those are the only

285
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:08,399
algorithms that actually makes sense to

286
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:11,149
be used and in in this context but there

287
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:13,799
isn't really a mechanism to do that

288
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:16,979
because the hash algorithms and the cosy

289
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:19,200
registry are are not identified in any

290
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,750
different way from you know signature

291
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,450
algorithms and yeah there's a good

292
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:27,240
reason for that because Jim shot refused

293
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:32,610
to do simple hashing and cosy for years

294
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:35,519
and and only a few months ago he kind of

295
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:41,729
accepted to try this so there is now a

296
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:43,590
hash ID in cozy but again this we

297
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,389
started this work like years ago and

298
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,730
there was nothing and Jim said no we're

299
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:49,949
not going to do this here this is

300
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:56,880
something that could be visibility to

301
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:58,919
include another valid registry for

302
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,990
hashing but it is literally not

303
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,059
necessary because the AI an unnamed

304
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:06,870
information registry is the general one

305
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:10,139
so if we use algorithms there and you

306
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,389
want to assign Jason for example that

307
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:15,899
works very better then we are going to

308
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:17,610
use the cozy specific one again but this

309
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,649
is something we can discuss the next

310
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:22,408
iteration of this document I assume it

311
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:24,768
is not a blocker today and because the

312
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:33,980
other document is not done also is

313
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:38,760
actually cool yeah okay Kathleen hi um I

314
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:41,669
guess there's there's a few things I'm

315
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:44,519
here for Eames a little low it's hard to

316
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:48,870
hear you in the room okay sorry

317
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:51,269
I'll do my best the cozy working group

318
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:55,729
is open so things can get fixed right

319
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:57,899
now you know as as Hank mentioned

320
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,240
hashing was added that's actually

321
00:22:57,899 --> 00:23:02,639
something I had conversations with Jim

322
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,440
and backchannels is one of the people

323
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:06,439
that was helping to motivate it

324
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:15,870
and yeah and back on the CW T I'm really

325
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:20,100
afraid of having multiple methods and

326
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:22,379
then just something that's only used for

327
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,959
coast wit and not used elsewhere you're

328
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,480
gonna have random developers who are

329
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,670
going to be implementing this and if

330
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,220
they're using something that's familiar

331
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,090
you know CW T which is yes very similar

332
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:38,610
it also does signing but it has claims

333
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:41,970
as well and is in a registry then I'm

334
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:45,229
just I I think we'd get better adoption

335
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,230
and adoption is important

336
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,639
that's actually before Kathleen gets out

337
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:58,379
of the quick can you just say something

338
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:01,199
again Kathleen because the me deco guys

339
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:01,830
were working on volume you can just say

340
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,789
hello again

341
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,949
oh hello that's a bit better not much

342
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:10,639
okay

343
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:14,700
all right sorry I can grab a headset

344
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:16,349
actually I do have one here it's in the

345
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,379
room man yeah it's not you it's it's us

346
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:21,149
here okay you were clear it was just

347
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:22,918
just as you ended speaking he asked if

348
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:25,379
it was better now and I was just wanted

349
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,839
you to continue for another half second

350
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:30,839
see if it was okay you need me to repeat

351
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:33,359
anything of what I've said no you're

352
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,609
good yeah it was hired as a thing again

353
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,349
it was at the level that everybody's

354
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:44,609
really silent and not typing we heard

355
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:49,559
you and I think here so hi again what

356
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:51,809
benefit will the CWT claims provide that

357
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,408
is my only extra concern because they

358
00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:58,678
conflict

359
00:24:52,409 --> 00:25:02,249
the semantics here so and this is gonna

360
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,799
be a one-off right how many other things

361
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:10,200
we'll just use the signing or the hash

362
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:11,849
function in this way by programmers I'm

363
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,099
not talking about the cozy part I'm

364
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:19,019
talking about the CWT part that had

365
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:20,999
brings its own claims familiarity just

366
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,129
that it's going to be a common thing

367
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:24,869
used right it might be a little bit

368
00:25:23,129 --> 00:25:27,899
overkill because the the claims in there

369
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:29,728
as well but you might have additional

370
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:32,039
claims on top of that I'm a software

371
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:33,929
package that you've done testing on or

372
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,839
whatnot or things that maybe aren't

373
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:38,399
quite covered you know there might be

374
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,158
other things that you want to attest

375
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:42,809
that you might want to do some of the

376
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,059
functionality that's being baked into

377
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:47,219
and eat where you have the nested claims

378
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:49,440
and just following that same structure

379
00:25:47,219 --> 00:25:52,759
so if you have dependent libraries you

380
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:58,049
might want to reference them within your

381
00:25:52,759 --> 00:26:00,359
larger CWT you actually provided

382
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,099
comments to eat to do it like hosts of

383
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,168
it so there now as the structures not

384
00:26:02,099 --> 00:26:04,820
sooner we already have nested claim sets

385
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:10,700
for

386
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:12,889
years now and innovate them and and for

387
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,289
the positive side I think there already

388
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:17,658
is basically the same we're just not

389
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:20,809
adding the CW needs egg in order to

390
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:23,269
prohibit people to sprinkle in CW TV

391
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:26,178
claims that do not belong into the thing

392
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:28,090
because if you are CW t people are

393
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:29,899
allowed to use the claim there and

394
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:32,269
that's the only thing we wanted to

395
00:26:29,899 --> 00:26:36,678
prohibit the rest is actually I think

396
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:40,419
today identical you can even using a CW

397
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:42,980
t positive powers coach read at home

398
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:46,009
okay alright so I mean I read the

399
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:50,509
document I understands cozy I was the ad

400
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:51,259
for it um so you know I I get how all of

401
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:55,070
this works

402
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:57,799
my concern is developers reading this

403
00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:00,350
and you know someone sing oh that's just

404
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:03,080
a CW T so I just use this package and

405
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:06,019
and just get it done as opposed to how

406
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:07,668
its described now which is very specific

407
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:10,669
and into the weeds

408
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:13,820
oh thanks care some developers which

409
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:16,730
might sound silly but if adoptions the

410
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:20,720
endgame then you make things as easy as

411
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,549
you can yeah I mean my biggest concern

412
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,190
right now is just you know as late in

413
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,830
the game as we are as far as working on

414
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:32,360
this draft I it's a barrier to adoption

415
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:34,250
and I get the draft out there so I know

416
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,258
there's a bunch of other standards

417
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,620
organizations that want to make use of

418
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:42,230
of this draft once it's it's published

419
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:46,008
I'm trying to balance the interests of

420
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,870
you know of the the sort of initial use

421
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:50,809
that we have and the in the community

422
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:53,330
around coasts wid as well as addressing

423
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:54,980
some of these other use cases and I like

424
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,309
to find the path forward that will allow

425
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,379
us to you know to to to Shepherd the

426
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,610
draft forward while we work to solves

427
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:03,289
you know some of these larger

428
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,689
integration question as a chair so if

429
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:09,710
they can already be if it can already be

430
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:14,120
parsed as with CWT can we add a bit of

431
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:18,230
text that prefixes the discussion of of

432
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:21,998
the cose signing that kind of

433
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:25,460
a lays the yeah you could use the CWT

434
00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:28,149
machinery and make this happen but then

435
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:32,359
keep most of the signing text in place

436
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:34,789
that would be great oh you're much

437
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:39,158
clearer now would you be willing to

438
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:46,970
submit some text for that purpose

439
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:49,879
Kathleen yeah I can I or one of the

440
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,859
authors I mean sounds like Hank has this

441
00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:52,879
in mind already so I don't know if he's

442
00:28:51,859 --> 00:29:07,939
the right person to do that

443
00:28:52,879 --> 00:29:10,570
or if I should go ahead I think I think

444
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,879
Hank do you have an ID a sense of

445
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:19,070
alright so so what I heard was um we

446
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:26,359
want to add some text to the draft to to

447
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:29,418
discuss how CWT use may fit into coast

448
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:33,859
width without defining the specifics of

449
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:36,049
that Toni nedelin so I agree with

450
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:37,879
Kathleen I mean this could just be a if

451
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:39,799
all you're all it's all it's happening

452
00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:43,189
is the claims are different they're not

453
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:46,070
in the same namespace the IANA registry

454
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:49,100
then it's just a profile on top of on

455
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:51,230
top of CWT which you're allowed to do so

456
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,969
you can add these you know you can do

457
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,999
the extension of your claims but you're

458
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,409
actually using CWT with these extension

459
00:29:55,999 --> 00:30:00,590
claims that are there well we don't have

460
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:02,659
any specific claims to find seven why

461
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,830
you're not using CWT at all if you if

462
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:08,269
you don't have any additional claims

463
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:11,389
defined because we have a support act

464
00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:13,580
defined and then and mime content-type

465
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:15,139
and all of that because we just want to

466
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,749
have simple pausing at the very first

467
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:21,649
bites if you call the CWT you do not

468
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:24,739
have that right so that could be a

469
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:26,658
problem with the parsers with the CW or

470
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,580
is it it is that yeah not actually

471
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,799
that's why there's no problem but but

472
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,629
you can write it could change

473
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:34,059
it could become a very potentially a

474
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:36,399
problem in that because people also its

475
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:39,070
issues that have CWT libraries out there

476
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,229
okay today so there has to be some I see

477
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:44,860
a point some but could could be prohibit

478
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:47,409
the use of the seven CWT claims is that

479
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,869
allow to have a profile for CWT that

480
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:52,600
says you're not allowed to use the CWT

481
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:57,519
crimes they would like pollute the

482
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,830
content base clean I know I know that is

483
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,129
I did we had there for a half and a half

484
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:05,199
year at CWT as the basis in the document

485
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:10,379
and then we realized oh is is breaking

486
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,379
it and we throw them out and and so

487
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:14,830
there's a possible solution here and if

488
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:16,779
you can look into that that would be

489
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,749
awesome because then my concerns would

490
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:22,080
be basically gone and we can use the

491
00:31:19,749 --> 00:31:24,580
whole idea but I did see some

492
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,949
interoperability problems with GWT

493
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:30,249
parsers out there today potential

494
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:32,259
problems so there was a so this is

495
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:34,720
saying finalizing this there was a good

496
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:37,809
reason that we've created a own SIBO

497
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,629
tech registry for this because we wanted

498
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:43,600
to have there's a lot of claims in there

499
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:45,939
and if you have a general CWT pasa you

500
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,709
create a lot of confusion overhead until

501
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,350
you are finally understand what this is

502
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,419
because they are not safety finding

503
00:31:50,350 --> 00:32:01,830
safety driving in this case you have to

504
00:31:52,419 --> 00:32:05,019
parse the whole thing and now hyoma knew

505
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,009
all I would advise your group to do is

506
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,570
if we're gonna do something in a

507
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,759
slightly non-standard way that we

508
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,950
explicitly document that design decision

509
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,070
so it's in the document and we don't

510
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,379
reopen it up when it gets ITF last

511
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,970
caller during the is it's not exactly

512
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:20,980
that we're doing it in a non-standard

513
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,139
way though we're just trying to decide

514
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,570
what standards to pick from I'm sure

515
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:27,248
sorry I'd my my words were imprecise I

516
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:34,809
think it would be valuing documenting

517
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:36,639
the design choice okay so so we have an

518
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:38,980
action to do that and I just wanted to

519
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:43,159
finish the conversation about the hash

520
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:45,320
identifier registry so my emails the

521
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,540
Cosi working group this morning I'm

522
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,919
asking for advice on what to what to do

523
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:55,430
as if if it will be possible to add some

524
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,710
sort of label to the cosy algorithms

525
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,780
registry that would allow us to you know

526
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:03,650
just point to the you know to the hash

527
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:05,120
algorithms you know to seek their advice

528
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,620
on on what to do

529
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,409
and based on that then we can have a

530
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,030
conversation a technical conversation

531
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,570
about whether we make the switch or

532
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:17,420
whether we stick with the the named hash

533
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,669
algorithm registry that we currently use

534
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,680
so hopefully that's something that we

535
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:24,410
can clear up on the list you know very

536
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,600
very quickly after this meeting but

537
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:29,870
those are basically the the only two

538
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,689
outstanding issues that haven't been

539
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,810
addressed everything else is more or

540
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,460
less ready to go and and the you know

541
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,460
the core of the specification hasn't

542
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:43,490
really changed and like three four

543
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:45,080
meetings now so just to get it wrapped

544
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,360
up maybe a little bit on the on the

545
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,620
frosting pardon that is kind of hard so

546
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,449
bright this is why I'm here again

547
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,179
Chanukah at my could we have some

548
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,610
deadlines for this so like three weeks

549
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,560
for this done and three for this done

550
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:59,540
and really be done at the time frame

551
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:03,320
because if you don't get this out this

552
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:05,510
year we might get in another vicious

553
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,690
cycle yeah I don't have sufficient

554
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,760
expertise in CWT to write this text so

555
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,280
I'm gonna need some help with that

556
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,860
no there you're either from hanker you

557
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,210
know from Kathleen or someone I mean but

558
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,690
I come to chime in because just make a

559
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,490
micro this thingy and then you write X

560
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,590
or something so I mean with within a

561
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:26,418
week of receiving that text and getting

562
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,520
some consensus within a working group I

563
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:30,529
could produce an updated draft here to

564
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,030
address that so I would like to know

565
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,220
when the text would be coming that's the

566
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,240
deadline I would like if we we had

567
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,889
something that went to working group

568
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,239
last call it got finalized and now we're

569
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:42,290
gonna make another change so we're gonna

570
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:45,199
make that change soon okay okay cuz on

571
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,909
so I make a solution proposal here just

572
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,850
proposal

573
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:51,080
Kathleen you couldn't make a concise

574
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,509
write-up of the requirements not the

575
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,460
solution we can start from there I can

576
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:59,230
incubate that here

577
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:04,280
the ietf and have this already on Friday

578
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:06,109
that is okay Friday would be perfect but

579
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,780
that would lower my level of angst yeah

580
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:11,690
yeah I really want to have done this

581
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,760
like very very soon but I need something

582
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,250
tangible that is the kind of checklist

583
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,170
like okay dun dun dun dun dun solution

584
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:20,240
then I can create solutions very fast

585
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,339
I've either just amorphous idea my head

586
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,810
is very hard for me through creditors

587
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:25,190
okay so Kathleen says in the chat that

588
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:29,770
she can try and get something done by

589
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,770
the by normal hours tomorrow thank you

590
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:33,710
so if Kathleen gets something done by

591
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,720
tomorrow you think you can get something

592
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:42,050
by the end of the week excellent yeah

593
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,868
and I'm also hoping to unlist at least

594
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,570
to close out the hash I identify our

595
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:51,700
yeah question as well um this week if I

596
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:56,589
can get the necessary feedback so if you

597
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:59,149
if we get the feedback done this week

598
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:00,710
then next week is Thanksgiving so maybe

599
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:02,810
by the end of the first week at December

600
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:05,060
you could have a Rev that would be great

601
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:07,430
yeah yeah that would be really nice it

602
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,450
would be really nice to hit the publish

603
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,990
on this before the end of the year yeah

604
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,049
excellent

605
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:27,680
okay I think that's that's it all right

606
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:29,920
thanks okay so this is the this is the

607
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,060
torch er document editor bhaiyya

608
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,900
requiring him to do an update when there

609
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,210
hasn't been an update

610
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:40,400
yeah the current terminology doctor's

611
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:42,710
expired unfortunately Adam and Bill are

612
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,150
not here on site today oh I am Hank

613
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,980
becuase by the way sorry I didn't

614
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,980
introduce me and say I have no slides I

615
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:57,440
so so the thing is that we have not

616
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:00,740
agreed on five core concepts in the

617
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,960
architecture and then reviving the

618
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:08,319
terminology Dolph is just shining words

619
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:11,960
around without any real target if I

620
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:13,730
would have chimed in the arc in in the

621
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,980
architecture document again which is

622
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:18,529
literally at no time for sorry and rets

623
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:22,039
covered up way more time in the last two

624
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:24,650
months and I anticipated so I couldn't

625
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:26,299
do it so yes I'm partially to be at

626
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:31,970
fault here and I'm sorry to the group

627
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:35,089
that there is no open document Adam and

628
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:38,538
I are in discussion about this and he

629
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:41,089
really wants to finish the architectural

630
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:43,430
core concepts and if that is done it

631
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:48,349
makes sense to pull it all into the

632
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:51,169
terminology again rollin hi

633
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:53,359
I've now I guess lost the bubble we

634
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,920
still want the terminal terminology

635
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,038
document we need the terminology

636
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,079
document we need to terminology document

637
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:03,380
because the architecture has to close at

638
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:07,450
some point and it has to be near future

639
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:09,769
so and then we have the other

640
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:12,019
complimentary solutions and they will

641
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:14,180
have slight modification to the terms

642
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:18,169
that the architecture cannot take into

643
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:19,970
account today unfortunately okay I will

644
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:23,839
we ask those same questions when we

645
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:26,558
bring up the architecture yeah is there

646
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,880
going to attract that chance yeah

647
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:30,559
they're on the agenda and they have some

648
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,519
slides so we will be talking about the

649
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:38,869
architecture document no right yeah

650
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:43,549
actually you see EPA PCP is that do undo

651
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:47,299
architecture first yeah we're gonna put

652
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:49,460
Jes first all right so we will revisit

653
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:53,599
terminology and architecture and now

654
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,920
we're going to Jess so I think we're

655
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,809
going to do the slides and you're going

656
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,140
to get in the remote cue and chat if you

657

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,170
I should look at chat and see if she's

661
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:27,210
answering me it's not letting her in the

662
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:35,840
queue why is it not letting her in the

663
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:35,840
queue let Kathleen in the queue did you

664
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:51,150

665
00:39:44,310 --> 00:40:09,480
queue just hit the red button just to

666
00:39:51,150 --> 00:40:18,300
see nope okay right so the slides are

667
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:20,220
self-explanatory yeah actually uh I've

668
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,240
had better luck with this in the Chrome

669
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:28,439
browser I don't know if you have a

670
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:31,649
Chrome browser oh she is using Chrome

671
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,790
okay oatmeal echo this is where we were

672
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,010
really supposed to arrange you as a

673
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:41,990
remote participant presenter and we did

674
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:41,990
not do that okay so you're a participant

675
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,910
another second or to meet echo is on the

676
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:59,220
case just go ahead and show the people

677
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:59,220
the slides okay oh this will be fun I

678
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:11,470
apologize in advance yes all right so

679
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,210
there was an update and and and the name

680
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:16,299
finally changed the update was what late

681
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:18,810
October is that right

682
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,680
Jesse you can correct me on that

683
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,870
relatively recent captures all the

684
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,049
feedback from everyone thank you for the

685
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,049
feedback

686
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,480
right here's here's the updates right so

687
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:47,470
I'm gonna go in reverse order so

688
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:51,610
clarified okay Jeske try again okay

689
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:54,520
did something here anyway okay further

690
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:57,700
clarify the use of MAC addresses as an

691
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:01,150
endpoint identifier added support for

692
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:03,970
the coast web in the swam extension and

693
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:06,430
then updated the diagram posture manager

694
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,600
and make the endpoint the focal point so

695
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:14,529
those are all pretty straightforward

696
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:17,350
changes oh wow there's a lot Jess I

697
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:19,090
curse you right now emphasize the need

698
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,740
to consider privacy regulations when

699
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:23,110
collecting and storing data these are

700
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,350
all pretty self-explanatory has let me

701
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:34,390
ask the quick question of how many folks

702
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:36,339
have read the update Hank has to the to

703
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:44,609
this previous update to this last update

704
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:49,440
that happened who's who's read buggies

705
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,440
yeah who's read the very latest version

706
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:11,350
yeah relatively recently okay so and as

707
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:16,270
Kathleen's commenting on jabber so she

708
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:18,520
has comments still outstanding so this

709
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,930
is this is kind of a pretty

710
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,090
comprehensive set of changes that have

711
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:25,990
been made from feedback based on all of

712
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:28,300
those folks and you can read through

713
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,700
this make clear protocols and interfaces

714
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,960
other than the NIA and that cough may be

715
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,730
supported

716
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:39,320
you know provisions with a machine

717
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:43,040
certificate all right

718
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:44,140
so any other required changes so I think

719
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,420
that there

720
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:52,100
Kathleen just commented she doesn't have

721
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:53,630
anything outstanding the says I would

722
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,000
really like to get some final

723
00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:00,280
read-throughs even if it's just getting

724
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:05,030
through the diff of the last version

725
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:11,750
Hanks Hank volunteer just now okay

726
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:19,820
Hank did Kathleen has volunteered can I

727
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:29,550
at least get one more yeah and Steven

728
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:43,290
thank you Jeff anything

729
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:46,020
do you want me to Mike Roman didn't know

730
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:49,520
I had a quick question about the type of

731
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:52,980
document this is so this was tad BCP and

732
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,980
I've forgotten did we discuss BCP versus

733
00:44:52,980 --> 00:45:01,500
standards track versus a proposed

734
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:03,410
standard so if I'm not mistaken that's

735
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,440
not even BCP isn't this informational

736
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:10,319
when I looked just did you change it and

737
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:18,900
when I looked at it it was BCP and I

738
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:22,170
wanted to talk about that yeah it says

739
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,960
BCP and it was standard to track and

740
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:27,300
moved off from standard so this is

741
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:32,450
Steven channeling Jess we did discuss

742
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:34,590
that in version 4 and decided BCP I

743
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:37,319
remember having the conversation I do

744
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:40,260
remember that I don't remember choosing

745
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:43,740
BCP versus informational but that's

746
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,120
probably a note somewhere let me go look

747
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:57,310
at the discussion and I'll come back if

748
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:59,859
I need you thank you so own ever my

749
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,410
I was wondering if Jessica put in the

750
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:27,730
chat if she remembers what the rationale

751
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:29,859
was I'm seeing nothing I was I think

752
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:40,690
game B CPC was harder than getting

753
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:42,250
information that's right isn't it yeah

754
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:44,530
you only read justice coming to the mic

755
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,360
first she said at the time informational

756
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:50,920
drafts were not being widely accepted if

757
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:53,230
that has changed we can reconsider yeah

758
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,850
I'll make a context-free statement I

759
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,230
have not read whatever was the

760
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:58,180
discussion we had if I read and I

761
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,160
apologize I'd forgotten I mean it part

762
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,480
of it is it seems like it's a profile so

763
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,000
we're doing all sorts of normative

764
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:08,050
language to describe behavior on other

765
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,790
kind of PSS and other stuff outside and

766
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,260
so kind of we're doing BCP would be

767
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:14,200
great to certainly talk about the basis

768
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:22,210
of all of that experience it it would

769
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:24,819
seem weird to be information yeah I I

770
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:26,350
was looking for a technical reason not

771
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,610
it's an easier to publish one way or the

772
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,860
other and I just I personally don't

773
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,150
remember what it was again I mean I'm

774
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,700
gonna have to do an ad review on this

775
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,680
kind of you might only find actually the

776
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,629
conversation as I recall it since you

777
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,819
just said that was there's a lot of

778
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,980
shoulds musts and others in an

779
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,260
informational document that seems a

780
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:48,670
little fishy and I believe that's why we

781
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:52,180
chose BCP standards would we thought was

782
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,910
going to be hard since this specifies a

783
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:59,259
bunch of things that aren't necessarily

784
00:47:53,910 --> 00:48:01,120
under our normative control okay let me

785
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:02,380
again let me find the discussion and

786
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,700
I'll come back if we need to talk about

787
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:11,510
it more okay any other questions on

788
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:15,859
draft okay I think what we need to do

789
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:19,329
then is to set a time window for those

790
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:23,150
additional reviews that we requested and

791
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:26,510
then based on that make a call on

792
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:28,369
mailing list about moving it forward I

793
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:30,680
mean we should we're going to move it

794
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:31,700
forward unless something I can't say

795
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,810
anything coming up that would cause us

796
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,299
not to move it forward

797
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:40,700
so what's a reasonable time frame for

798
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:53,060
getting those reviews how long is the

799
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:54,910
document I thought it was like 60

800
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:57,529
something that I could be wrong and

801
00:48:54,910 --> 00:49:05,290
close to being able to tell you but not

802
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:10,099
quite no momento 41 yes you were closer

803
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:20,599
what do you want pages Stephen it's a

804
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:23,349
very long flight home okay so so I'm

805
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:26,540
gonna be the first week in December

806
00:49:23,349 --> 00:49:28,569
okay so our comments first week in

807
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,569
December

808
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:41,440
all right so I think next up is

809
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:41,440
architecture

810
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:06,680
okay I think we're gonna do a demeanor

811
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:06,680
variable oh look at that okay Adam speak

812
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:16,229
yes we can hear you now good

813
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:18,058
okay so architecture updates I'll be

814
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:20,308
honest with you bill is having technical

815
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:22,769
difficulties and he was actually

816
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:27,180
supposed to be the person presenting so

817
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:31,288
instead he did see me so good morning

818
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:34,680
all right cool so we pushed an update on

819
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:37,559
the 29th as the slide says I've covered

820
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,709
a bunch of issues in the draft that were

821
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:47,190
up in github I don't think we have to go

822
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:54,328
through necessarily all of those can we

823
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:56,900
go to the next slide as we write so we

824
00:50:54,329 --> 00:50:59,400
did add a really super simple

825
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:03,239
architectural overview diagram that

826
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,130
basically starts with producer to

827
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:08,849
integration service to consumer find a

828
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:11,789
diagram all the subsequent diagrams are

829
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:14,009
now referenced as role based diagrams

830
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:17,459
instead of component diagrams ago that

831
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:19,589
we've had discussions about being more

832
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:21,989
rural focused rather than component

833
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:23,788
focused to try to clarify that all of

834
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:26,609
these things can be composite depending

835
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:33,890
on how a vendor might implement to

836
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:33,890
rather might package them so next slide

837
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:40,920
cool right other updates we did we

838
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,660
organized it so I think you might want

839
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,759
to take a look at it we were hoping to

840
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,319
get some feedback from you but as you

841
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:47,969
mentioned earlier you didn't have the

842
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:51,839
time so we just went ahead and took a

843
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:55,589
stab at it again we have updated

844
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:59,308
sections for collections of architecture

845
00:51:55,589 --> 00:52:02,038
and evaluations of architecture and bill

846
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:05,219
actually templated sections for each

847
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:06,509
security domain workflow we ended up

848
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:08,610
spending a lot of time on the

849
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:11,700
configuration assessment one

850
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:13,220
for obvious reasons I think but it just

851
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,779
happens to be the one we know the best

852
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:22,740
it would be cool to get some help for

853
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:24,990
some of the others next site yep what's

854
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,790
next more drastic updates we hope right

855
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:30,870
there are a few issues remaining in

856
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:32,279
github one that I think is what that

857
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:36,810
we'll definitely need some help on I

858
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:40,110
think Kathleen is presently attached to

859
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:44,370
adding a section or subsection somewhere

860
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:46,380
on a test station and then there's a few

861
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:49,620
other things that we need to figure out

862
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,090
like do we remove the XMPP specific

863
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:54,359
information and start putting that into

864
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:59,610
its own draft you know things like that

865
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:08,340
so I think that's it next slide is there

866
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:09,810
another side nope that's him okay I'm

867
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:12,870
curious I think you said something

868
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:15,920
earlier actually about five outstanding

869
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:18,390
issues with the architecture draft

870
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:25,110
related to the terminology I was curious

871
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:28,500
as to what those are is the

872
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:32,070
reorganization like for the orchestrator

873
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,750
the role and the interfaces before they

874
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:37,380
were interfaces they're not interfaces

875
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:39,630
anymore all this is now I think three of

876
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,700
them the at least addressed by the issue

877
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:44,850
tracker at least they're reviewable now

878
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,640
and then two more open ones I sent you a

879
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:49,560
list of the five items I don't know

880
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,540
months ago probably it's somewhere I can

881
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,770
find it again so we have to just

882
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,650
cross-check that these are all

883
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,090
consistent now because if I change two

884
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,470
of them and then the other ones change

885
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:01,320
and we change everything it's all the

886
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:03,810
churn it's like like module run and so I

887
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,820
would like to have them stable and if

888
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:08,130
they're stable we can move on to the

889
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:10,200
next phase and then sync it with the

890
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:11,430
other text and that should be easy

891
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,990
because you're familiar with the other

892
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,410
text so we can do it in concert that'd

893
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:18,810
be even faster

894
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:20,190
okay there can you resend that and then

895
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:22,759
we should connect on it so that we can

896
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,760
rather be clear

897
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,700
I'm also curious how many people might

898
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:30,700
have read the update I mean it's been

899
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:34,240
out for a while now actually a couple

900
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:40,470
weeks three weeks something like that so

901
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:44,520
how many people read the draft that's -

902
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:49,899
Hank and Chris okay

903
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:52,660
more ISIL be good hi this is women

904
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:56,740
ginger so this is kind of a supporting

905
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:58,930
document for us how I'm trying to kind

906
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,240
of figure out how to as we advance this

907
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:02,680
how we frame and kind of this so as far

908
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,649
as I can see this document isn't

909
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:09,700
actually referenced by any of the PS

910
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:12,160
work that we're doing any of the what

911
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:14,020
work is right so one would think that

912
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,450
this is a supporting document to help

913
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:18,099
the standards that the stuff on the kind

914
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:20,828
of the proposed standards and this isn't

915
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:22,450
actually reference by any of the PS the

916
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:29,410
proposed standards were taught we have

917
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:33,189
in the working odd to me it's a great

918
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:34,420
observation it is you know I I don't

919
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:36,160
know why that is

920
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,619
to be honest and maybe that's because

921
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,629
this document it's taken a while I mean

922
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:42,280
this is really the second incarnation of

923
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:47,020
an architecture drafting this and it's

924
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,970
working very possibly or third I'm this

925
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:52,540
is Hank on the mic one of the reasons is

926
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:57,310
that the new architectural layout has

927
00:55:52,540 --> 00:56:01,569
this conveyance bus in the center of it

928
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:05,589
and which is the biggest difference to

929
00:56:01,569 --> 00:56:10,119
the endpoint posture compliance profile

930
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:12,880
which it does not have this bus in the

931
00:56:10,119 --> 00:56:17,260
middle of it and XMP peak but when to

932
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:19,660
Maya and that right basic assumption for

933
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:22,569
this bus could also be diva's or it

934
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,859
could be a iff or whatever it's multiple

935
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:27,310
solutions for this we have a lot of

936
00:56:23,859 --> 00:56:29,770
hackathons where this works but the

937
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:33,670
primary solution that we wanted to pull

938
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:36,259
in is an RFC now so that is hard for

939
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:41,119
that RFC to reference

940
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:45,619
that's Arsenal anymore right so I think

941
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:47,630
also the the PCP draft that solution

942
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:49,940
I think this architecture draft and Bill

943
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:54,350
you can correct me in the chat if I'm

944
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:57,109
wrong is a collection architecture with

945
00:56:54,350 --> 00:57:07,520
relative to this draft it's like a sub

946
00:56:57,109 --> 00:57:08,930
architecture if you will sorry I'm so I

947
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,930
guess the question I have again is just

948
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:15,589
I'm maybe I don't yet clearly understand

949
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:16,250
if this is an architecture driving or

950
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:18,410
kind of work

951
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:22,790
what is the interrelationship between

952
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:25,220
that I mean I think some of this is a

953
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:27,410
historical artifact of the problems the

954
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:29,118
working group had early on so they tried

955
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,980
to do an architecture document well we

956
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,750
tried to do an architecture document we

957
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,000
got all tied up in that and I said we

958
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:37,970
said let's take a step back and and and

959
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,260
do some of the pieces and we tabled the

960
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,350
architecture document and then we

961
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:43,550
thought well maybe we can come back and

962
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:45,020
do an architecture document that pulls

963
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:47,359
it all together the other thing I'd like

964
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:50,119
to point out to our jabber scribe who is

965
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:53,270
not actually Deborah scribing Cathleen

966
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:54,859
actually did say in the a chat that an

967
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:56,300
architecture document can come at the

968
00:57:54,859 --> 00:58:02,330
end and serve as a document to pull all

969
00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:04,040
the existing ones together she did sorry

970
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:05,990
I didn't see that last sentence I was

971
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,340
reading it earlier so I think that's an

972
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,930
important point though I whether you

973
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:12,530
agree with that or not I think would be

974
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:14,359
a question for you but yeah I mean I'm

975
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:17,869
preparing for the conversation as we

976
00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:19,700
advance this document forward there is

977
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,950
certainly some reticence in other parts

978
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,660
of the I use you to publish kind of

979
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,160
supporting documents we typically say

980
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,230
supporting documents helped us drive

981
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,700
kind of other things and I'm just I'm

982
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,619
struggling kinda with the asymmetry of

983
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:33,439
being able to articulate what this is

984
00:58:30,619 --> 00:58:35,560
helping us drive or decide or document

985
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,660
even frankly because there really is new

986
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,460
dependencies as we can see between the

987
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,500
kind of the the other standards work in

988
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,740
this document we can of course take this

989
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,740
offline

990
00:58:47,910 --> 00:59:09,640
okay any other questions so this is Hank

991
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:11,770
I was reviewing the epc Peterson I'm not

992
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:14,259
actually mistaken I'm pretty sure it

993
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:15,820
references it but maybe the reference is

994
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,910
a little problem so therefore doesn't

995
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:23,850
show up in the reference by link I think

996
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:23,850
I could check that because it takes away

997
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:38,710
okay I think we'll get to this and we do

998
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,029
- they get to next steps the other

999
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:43,540
question I wanted to ask about this

1000
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:46,210
document was we had in lieu of having

1001
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:49,330
virtual interim we had had a design

1002
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:51,280
meeting and whether that was effective

1003
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:52,810
and whether that you know the one of

1004
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,240
those are not I know we had talked about

1005
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:58,900
doing one between the first one you did

1006
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:00,640
and this meeting and sort of as a chair

1007
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:04,330
failure we didn't get that scheduled for

1008
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:05,560
you so um is that I do I know if you

1009
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:09,100
want to talk about that in the context

1010
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:12,400
of way forward or either one yeah I mean

1011
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:14,200
I I thought it went well I think those

1012
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,060
who participated I mean they

1013
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,339
participated right we had a handful of

1014
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:21,400
people actually talking about it and

1015
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:23,440
getting it getting some things resolved

1016
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:25,330
collecting issues we addressed quite a

1017
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,030
few those issues and I think just if we

1018
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:30,210
continue doing that it could be helpful

1019
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:30,210
okay

1020
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:38,619
I think what what I think would be

1021
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:43,529
useful for would be for you or bill to

1022
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:46,450
drive those meanings like we can provide

1023
01:00:43,529 --> 01:00:48,730
facilities if you made them but sure

1024
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:50,879
maybe if you can drive the scheduling of

1025
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:55,599
them that would be great

1026
01:00:50,880 --> 01:01:02,079
got it bill to drive all design the

1027
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:08,499
homes chair / note-taker wrote down arch

1028
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:09,970
authors this is Ron I just kind of want

1029
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:11,230
to make sure we don't end on a noon I

1030
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,669
mean if the one who wants to publish

1031
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:14,499
this because they think they will pull

1032
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:16,119
it this will pull it all together when

1033
01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:17,890
we're done the work and I'm happy to

1034
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:21,099
kind of advance it it's just I think we

1035
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:22,930
need to be prepared means you're kind of

1036
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:24,430
prepared to have to be able to kind of

1037
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:26,470
answer that question and you know be

1038
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:28,450
cognizant all of us we're making kind of

1039
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:30,189
the other documents that we frame those

1040
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:32,499
other documents as solving problems that

1041
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:35,190
we outlined in the architecture right

1042
01:01:32,499 --> 01:01:39,029
agree so it one last comment on that and

1043
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:41,739
in the slides I think we did talk about

1044
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:44,319
potentially taking the solution II kind

1045
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:46,299
of parts of the draft that are in there

1046
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:49,019
I think they're stuffed back in appendix

1047
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:51,279
at this point taking those out and

1048
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:53,499
submitting that there's another draft so

1049
01:01:51,279 --> 01:01:55,720
maybe in the XMPP grid-based

1050
01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:58,200
specific you know solution to this

1051
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,519
architecture that could be viewed as

1052
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:11,259
work that's being driven by this

1053
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:25,749
document in some in some way right okay

1054
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:27,930
anything else on this document I guess

1055
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:30,988
we can get Adam out of the queue here

1056
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,989
thank you

1057
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,140
I'm gonna actually make Rome a little

1058
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:40,259
bit happy in his reference to the

1059
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:41,730
documents and document references but

1060
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,190
not in something you can search and say

1061
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:47,910
yes to you

1062
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:49,830
okay so information model so I haven't

1063
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:52,830
really made a lot of progress on what

1064
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:54,509
what's in the information model so it's

1065
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:56,400
really hard to do because I there's not

1066
01:02:54,510 --> 01:03:00,660
enough implementation to try and make

1067
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:02,820
sense of how to make a minimal viable

1068
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:08,310
set of information elements that make us

1069
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:14,010
able to go forward but for Hank as to

1070
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:15,960
the you know ask in one of the design

1071
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:18,660
meetings it is actually on github

1072
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,970
so there's the link Hank and feel free

1073
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:25,080
to send issues anyone else can too but I

1074
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:26,939
know Hank loves that so feel free to

1075
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,279
send those there's no real updates in it

1076
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,590
but it's there it's really minimal so

1077
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,140
you know it'll take you all the 15

1078
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:35,880
minutes to read all right so why so

1079
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,350
little progress I commented on this a

1080
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:41,010
little bit already all right just a

1081
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:42,118
moment ago right so trying to understand

1082
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:45,350
the combination of the architecture

1083
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:49,770
draft and implementation for sockem and

1084
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:52,049
it's not concrete enough so I've started

1085
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:58,560
to do some more kind of implementation

1086
01:03:52,050 --> 01:04:00,990
experience here so I'm internally at my

1087
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:04,410
place we're working to build a prototype

1088
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:07,649
of an XMPP grid implementation for

1089
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:10,440
sockem I'm trying to use that to drive

1090
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:12,720
forward this I've had some off list

1091
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:14,670
conversations with Bill and Adam as to

1092
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:19,410
capture some of the work that was done

1093
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:22,890
in previous hackathons as to what needs

1094
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:25,350
to be done in extensions those

1095
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:29,700
extensions to you know kind of command

1096
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:32,730
sets etc for XMPP grid would really

1097
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,859
Drive what the understanding of what the

1098
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:40,500
minimum viable information model needs

1099
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:43,770
to be so at long-term or medium-term

1100
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:47,610
some some term that isn't in the next

1101
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:50,640
week is that there would actually be

1102
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:53,070
interoperable XMPP grid implementations

1103
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,850
that can do something novel with regards

1104
01:04:53,070 --> 01:05:01,800
to sockem so I did put like the sketch

1105
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:04,250
of a draft so Adam bill I know that we

1106
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,170
exchanged all of like three emails but

1107
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:08,370
and I know that this would include some

1108
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:10,800
of the information that's currently in

1109
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:12,779
the appendix of architecture but we need

1110
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,450
I need to like kind of the next set of

1111
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:17,490
details as in you know what are the

1112
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:21,629
actual commands we'd be exchanging how

1113
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:25,529
do we do discovery and I'd like to put

1114
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:30,000
that in that kind of draft so there's

1115
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:31,740
another URL for a draft there I and I'm

1116
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,330
happy to collaborate with anyone else

1117
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:35,399
who wants to start to kind of work on

1118
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:37,650
some implementation because I think I

1119
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,370
need that to inform kind of the next set

1120
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:43,710
of stuff all right so I kind of covered

1121
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:45,509
this somewhat but this is kind of my

1122
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:49,800
near-term what do I want to actually

1123
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:51,750
build and do a test on so the template

1124
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,870
in the architecture draft is there and

1125
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:56,250
so Roman - your kind of comments about

1126
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:57,690
you know things don't reference this

1127
01:05:56,250 --> 01:06:01,320
will definitely reference as we go

1128
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:03,240
forward to capture kind of oval

1129
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,010
evaluation results one of the things

1130
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,140
that we do at my place is a lot of IP

1131
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:08,760
fix work so the thing that I've been

1132
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:11,790
trying to figure out how to add is how

1133
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:14,160
do I add IP fix observations to compare

1134
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:15,960
against oval observations already in

1135
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,430
there and frankly I don't know how to

1136
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:22,350
implement it because it's not documented

1137
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:24,000
enough to implement and so these are the

1138
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,140
kind of the the mini goals I want to be

1139
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,850
able to put those two sets of

1140
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:30,990
information in there and then query

1141
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:33,380
from implementations either direction to

1142
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:35,640
find what those set of results were and

1143
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,770
some kind of mechanism that would allow

1144
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:39,750
us to do comparisons against network

1145
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:44,730
observations against hosts evaluation

1146
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:48,150
results so and and as we talked in the

1147
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:50,610
last design meeting you one of the

1148
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:52,920
concerns was we're very desktop focused

1149
01:06:50,610 --> 01:06:54,840
so if I can get those two things working

1150
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,680
the next step for me is how do I get

1151
01:06:54,840 --> 01:07:00,210
something that isn't a desktop computer

1152
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,759
involved so I don't know what that is

1153
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,010
yeah

1154
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,710
but that's a to be determined and I'm

1155
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:08,680
happy to have that conversation in help

1156
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:12,730
on the list or in one of the design

1157
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:16,299
meetings so all of this would let me

1158
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:18,280
drive to what the minimum basic

1159
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:20,170
information elements are two kind of

1160
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,850
enable this set of functionality and how

1161
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:23,260
that interoperates between the

1162
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:26,980
architecture and an actual

1163
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:28,960
implementation and that's the goal so

1164
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:32,230
I'd like to in combination with

1165
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,510
architecture I don't know if that would

1166
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:36,310
be a standard or a document we throw

1167
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:38,080
away to your point room and about are

1168
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:41,740
these is that a publishable document it

1169
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,840
is a nom I don't know yet I'm not I'm

1170
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:47,319
not far enough along in thinking about

1171
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:51,670
if writing down kind of this is how we

1172
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:54,280
actually implemented in I in in XMPP

1173
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:57,190
grid is a document destined for

1174
01:07:54,280 --> 01:08:00,130
publication or not it very well may be

1175
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:03,250
but I cross that bridge when we get

1176
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:07,660
there and the documents a real document

1177
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:24,729
and we can have that conversation that's

1178
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:38,559
it any questions any discussion is

1179
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:42,899
anybody awake had had to run it good now

1180
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,900
I'm struggling with joining two other

1181
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:51,370
the information model I think does not

1182
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:53,470
have to be standard strike but it has to

1183
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:55,450
be very defined information information

1184
01:08:53,470 --> 01:09:00,009
elements in it that can be instantiated

1185
01:08:55,450 --> 01:09:03,160
in solution so yes XMPP grid and the

1186
01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:04,359
terminology draft are basically circling

1187
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:07,720
that one there are some are all

1188
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:11,289
interconnected and therefore I think

1189
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:13,699
that while moving on with the

1190
01:09:11,288 --> 01:09:17,209
centerpiece of the architecture and

1191
01:09:13,698 --> 01:09:20,299
getting that done we basically have to

1192
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:22,639
start terminology information but at the

1193
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:24,589
same time to accommodate that again and

1194
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:26,328
I think that goes hand-in-hand because

1195
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:29,839
they cannot be redundant you are about

1196
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:31,219
the extra information and the document

1197
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:32,899
is about the things that move the

1198
01:09:31,219 --> 01:09:35,089
information and the architecture tells

1199
01:09:32,899 --> 01:09:37,249
you how and and I think this should be

1200
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:39,318
very aligned and maybe we collect some

1201
01:09:37,249 --> 01:09:41,448
of them I don't ignore to that in the

1202
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:44,209
end actually and people think less

1203
01:09:41,448 --> 01:09:46,209
documents are easier to ISG as a gateway

1204
01:09:44,209 --> 01:09:48,559
function that is probably true

1205
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:54,739
unfortunately they are not on the same

1206
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:58,369
track maybe so I don't know yeah I think

1207
01:09:54,739 --> 01:10:03,138
as we I think one of the things that we

1208
01:09:58,369 --> 01:10:05,409
haven't done well is work on actual

1209
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:08,090
implementations that we can interoperate

1210
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:10,398
so that's kind of a push that I want to

1211
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:13,909
make and I want to align those

1212
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:15,919
interoperable implementations against

1213
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:20,018
kind of information model architecture

1214
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:23,419
etc and I will I don't want to

1215
01:10:20,019 --> 01:10:25,849
predispose the answer of what track

1216
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:28,789
things are on until we know what what

1217
01:10:25,849 --> 01:10:30,469
documents shakeout what way so what

1218
01:10:28,789 --> 01:10:32,360
documents really need to be a standard

1219
01:10:30,469 --> 01:10:36,289
such that this would give you enough

1220
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:41,808
information to have workable solutions

1221
01:10:36,289 --> 01:10:43,699
in the long run this is Steven

1222
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:46,129
channeling Adam Montville on Jabbar he

1223
01:10:43,699 --> 01:10:47,808
notes that he is still interested in

1224
01:10:46,129 --> 01:10:50,840
continuing these conversations so he

1225
01:10:47,809 --> 01:10:52,459
these discussions so in response to your

1226
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:56,209
earlier question about is anyone still

1227
01:10:52,459 --> 01:10:59,148
interested Adam says yes yeah so I I

1228
01:10:56,209 --> 01:11:01,249
will say that Adam bill I mean you guys

1229
01:10:59,149 --> 01:11:03,019
did respond and tell me what the what

1230
01:11:01,249 --> 01:11:04,999
timeline I should expect your responses

1231
01:11:03,019 --> 01:11:08,449
and you guys aren't you know out of the

1232
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:09,889
bounds of whatever so so the to the

1233
01:11:08,449 --> 01:11:11,688
extent that we bring it back to some

1234
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:15,079
design meetings I think would be useful

1235
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:17,269
for everybody and bill didn't prepend

1236
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:20,179
this with Mike but I think this is

1237
01:11:17,269 --> 01:11:22,340
relevant bill says he is still working

1238
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:23,929
on getting more XMPP specific

1239
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,890
information into its own draft

1240
01:11:23,929 --> 01:11:37,600
and over to you for your folks okay

1241
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:37,600
response to your great okay

1242
01:12:20,389 --> 01:12:25,739
okay all right so this is actually the

1243
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:28,079
way ahead portion but we don't have a

1244
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:31,999
slide that says way ahead in my head we

1245
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:36,659
did but apparently in reality we do not

1246
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:39,179
so you wanted to talk about milestones I

1247
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:48,209
wanted to talk about meetings so why

1248
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:50,069
don't we go to milestones first yeah my

1249
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:52,229
indelicate question about milestones is

1250
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:54,179
actually unrelated to the dates to the

1251
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:57,359
things we have existing documents on but

1252
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:59,760
we have milestones to do things that I

1253
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:02,849
don't even see individual unadopted

1254
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:05,369
things for in the queue and I just want

1255
01:13:02,849 --> 01:13:07,919
to ask the question we're still holding

1256
01:13:05,369 --> 01:13:11,759
a marker to do that work or do I just

1257
01:13:07,919 --> 01:13:14,068
not understand the purpose of other

1258
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:17,399
documents that we do have in the queue

1259
01:13:14,069 --> 01:13:33,229
so specifically I'm talking about yang

1260
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:33,229
push yeah you CPU transfer so go ahead

1261
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:41,189
so I think that there's as we move

1262
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:44,280
forward implementation yang push could

1263
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:48,719
very well come back I did have a hallway

1264
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:53,188
conversation with with Nancy and she'd

1265
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:56,760
be willing to interoperate Cisco's XMPP

1266
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:58,739
and which they did built some some yang

1267
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:01,349
capability I don't know if that's its

1268
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:04,409
own document at this point but as far as

1269
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:04,679
a marker for a possible thing I'm okay

1270
01:14:04,409 --> 01:14:06,419
with that

1271
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:09,209
and Hank might have some comments on

1272
01:14:06,419 --> 01:14:12,749
yang push as a document but I don't

1273
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:15,510
believe and unless I don't know if jess

1274
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:21,469
is still on it if jess has some thoughts

1275
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:21,469
on on transfer

1276
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:26,600
she should be just should be asleep now

1277
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:37,200
okay so this is woman speaking again

1278
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:39,330
okay I guess I'm just a little confused

1279
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,170
because we said we would be done a year

1280
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:42,300
and a half ago

1281
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:46,770
are we still sure we want to do this I

1282
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:49,020
guess is the question let's talk so when

1283
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:50,610
you came on board in July is that when

1284
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,320
you came on board we updated the

1285
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:54,570
milestones that we had drafts for and

1286
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:57,299
the others I just left alone because I'm

1287
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:59,969
not aware of drafts that are coming in

1288
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,440
so they're in our charter those are the

1289
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:03,600
original published milestones from the

1290
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:07,980
Charter and you're right we don't

1291
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:11,280
currently have any drafts for that so so

1292
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:13,950
so does the think yang push was blocked

1293
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:17,929
and blocked and pushed back and blocked

1294
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:20,639
as arbitrary reasons for three years

1295
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:22,860
that is a reason why we did not proceed

1296
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:26,130
over that because it was churned so hard

1297
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:28,259
the people and he's back and forth that

1298
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:29,850
the primary authors actually said okay

1299
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:33,210
we are abandoning this and giving the

1300
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:37,380
igf so fortunately at the last turn they

1301
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:39,810
made it so that is a good thing back

1302
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,640
when there was not so much turn we've

1303
01:15:39,810 --> 01:15:43,890
provided at the hackathon a proof of

1304
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:46,050
concept at yank wash and XMPP quite

1305
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:48,570
literally with running code already

1306
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:51,030
could exists but all the people that

1307
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:56,160
were involved in that were demotivated

1308
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:59,670
by the prospect process in areas and are

1309
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:03,150
gone that we that's that is a reason why

1310
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:05,280
this process has stalled right so but so

1311
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:07,980
there was the ancient history which was

1312
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,559
all of the pushback and churn and then

1313
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,750
there was the hackathon /re chartering

1314
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,340
activity and at that point we were like

1315
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:16,530
is this something we still want to do or

1316
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:19,110
not all of that pushback had happened

1317
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:20,460
all of that history existed and then at

1318
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:22,889
that point in time we said yes we do

1319
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:25,080
want to do this yes but there's no draft

1320
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:27,630
on the table I'm not gonna write it so

1321
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,460
yeah and I cannot write it at the moment

1322
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,430
because I'm overloaded and the people

1323
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:34,550
that would like to have written that

1324
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:37,909
jump ship and said we will not

1325
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:39,440
come back again so at this point it's

1326
01:16:37,909 --> 01:16:41,509
the draft were to come onto the table it

1327
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:45,138
would come from you is that what you're

1328
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:47,510
saying right now that you are still I'm

1329
01:16:45,139 --> 01:16:51,530
more inclined to convince some of the

1330
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:53,389
people to come back because I cannot do

1331
01:16:51,530 --> 01:16:55,909
it everything that I said I cannot write

1332
01:16:53,389 --> 01:17:00,829
all every draft as a lead author I'd

1333
01:16:55,909 --> 01:17:02,839
like to be awful but I cannot be I guess

1334
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:04,969
my point is the point at which we had

1335
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:08,090
the conversation about rewriting about

1336
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:10,639
reach our Turing we had the conversation

1337
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:11,900
about the history mm-hmm and we knew

1338
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:14,239
what the history was at that point in

1339
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,369
time and we still said yes this is

1340
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:18,440
something still worth doing so if we

1341
01:17:16,369 --> 01:17:20,960
think at this point in time it's still

1342
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,909
worth doing then we should leave it here

1343
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,540
and we should update the date that makes

1344
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:25,369
more sense

1345
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:28,369
we can also change the scope a little

1346
01:17:25,369 --> 01:17:29,960
bit because I'm focusing on concise yang

1347
01:17:28,369 --> 01:17:31,549
to the Metro right now and that's

1348
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,920
basically also using push but it's

1349
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:36,260
always in binary and I have no support

1350
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:38,030
on that route that comes yesterday

1351
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:41,659
confirmed that is rough by them you want

1352
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:46,009
to do that and therefore I think there

1353
01:17:41,659 --> 01:17:47,929
is a slight change of term and

1354
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:50,469
civilization but this concept will be

1355
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,469
stay the same

1356
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:59,030
I'm okay putting a new gate on this if

1357
01:17:57,619 --> 01:18:00,440
we change the direction as you were

1358
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:01,790
saying again we should get feedback from

1359
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:11,210
the working group that that's the thing

1360
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:13,820
we want to do so really quick I will say

1361
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:15,170
that if a yang push document came here I

1362
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:19,699
would certainly be interested in

1363
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:21,199
providing review support writing it I'm

1364
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:23,058
not going to be the one that writes it

1365
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,769
and brings it here by any means but it

1366
01:18:23,059 --> 01:18:26,989
is here I'd be interested look at it

1367
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:35,330
okay but that's very helpful Steven

1368
01:18:26,989 --> 01:18:38,450
thank you so since the mile

1369
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:41,750
is actually an initial draft do you want

1370
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:46,269
to say six months or do you are you as

1371
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:46,270
ad comfortable with us leaving as 2018

1372
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:53,839
if more discussion needs to happen to

1373
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,130
figure out what the plan for it is I'm

1374
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:56,810
perfectly comfortable about it maybe

1375
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,730
part of it is I wanted to hear that the

1376
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:02,300
milestone is even something that we want

1377
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:04,459
to do yeah typically again it's just I'm

1378
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:06,020
observing an abnormal physics typically

1379
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,220
we have a milestone and the challenge we

1380
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,320
have is that there are competing

1381
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,820
individual things and we don't know kind

1382
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,889
of what to do with it and there is just

1383
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:14,330
the even the absence of anything as the

1384
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:15,350
starting point and we said we wanted to

1385
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,640
do it a long time ago

1386
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,260
so if it's still the thing we want to do

1387
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,230
and we just need to figure out the

1388
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:22,580
timeline you get there I'm perfectly

1389
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:23,750
okay so we'll leave the date for now and

1390
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:26,870
we'll figure out a timeline going

1391
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:31,700
forward so the second one was the ECP

1392
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:33,010
over transfer mechanism I have no idea

1393
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:47,720
on that

1394
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:53,840
no clue anybody hey guys you missed me

1395
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:57,170
right we did i I don't know I see value

1396
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:59,480
in if I'm understanding what you see P

1397
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:04,820
over transfer mechanism is I think it's

1398
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:09,049
no PC P over transfer mechanism and I

1399
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:12,110
mentioned earlier that the PCP is work

1400
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:15,410
the sacrum architecture basically views

1401
01:20:12,110 --> 01:20:19,400
as a collection some architecture if you

1402
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:22,460
will or collection architecture that and

1403
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:25,280
and I think that e PCP over transfer

1404
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:27,230
really intends to get the information

1405
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:31,130
that that collection architecture is

1406
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:33,889
grabbing into the integration service

1407
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:38,420
for further downstream use so I think

1408
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:41,750
it's still valuable at some point yeah

1409
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:43,370
so we'll see how that turns out and

1410
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:45,170
somebody in the room has a different

1411
01:20:43,370 --> 01:20:46,519
memory different recollection of what

1412
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:50,290
that is

1413
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:50,290
you know who's correctly

1414
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:55,099
so if we think we still want to do that

1415
01:20:53,720 --> 01:21:01,310
I just want to ask the question who is

1416
01:20:55,100 --> 01:21:04,040
gonna do that good question as a

1417
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:07,850
follow-up question to that whose was

1418
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:11,780
this in the first place like why - to

1419
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:13,820
put that there cuz I don't like I mean I

1420
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:15,170
guess what it means if you add them

1421
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,040
right I mean I can kind of kind of

1422
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:19,970
figure it out but I have no idea what

1423
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:22,160
that even means I mean I think it's a

1424
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:24,620
ghost milestone I mean was I mean jess

1425
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:27,260
is not here is it possible that this is

1426
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:29,180
something that jess was I want to make

1427
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:31,760
sure that we don't take it off and it's

1428
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:34,400
something that she cares about so I but

1429
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,320
I don't know what it is yeah you know

1430
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,519
also again I'm generally I would be

1431
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,900
concerned that we don't even understand

1432
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,490
what the milestone is and then kind of

1433
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:43,009
the question is we all think it's a good

1434
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:44,780
idea but is does someone want to work on

1435
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:46,910
it and we can think it's a good idea but

1436
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:49,099
no one's working on it it's not clear we

1437
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:50,720
should but we can take it to the list of

1438
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:53,750
sorts sort that out if we need to do the

1439
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:55,370
archaeology I know that Adam was the

1440
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,660
Adam and I were the co-chairs at the

1441
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:58,070
time that we did the reach are during

1442
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:59,990
discussion and everything that was in

1443
01:21:58,070 --> 01:22:04,519
the chartering discussion was something

1444
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:09,070
that somebody was advocating for yeah

1445
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,070
and so I just don't remember what it was

1446
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:19,130
okay so we will look into that one a

1447
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:21,950
little bit more the really descriptor

1448
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:25,220
one I know we've had a conversation on

1449
01:22:21,950 --> 01:22:28,040
this go ahead Steven configuration yeah

1450
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:29,540
the configuration checklist um yeah it's

1451
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,460
kind of been in a holding pattern for a

1452
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:34,760
long time it still is in a holding

1453
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:38,030
pattern at this time so I think at this

1454
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:40,730
point it makes sense to not represent it

1455
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:42,380
as a hard milestone but as work that

1456
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:45,400
might get done and if it does it would

1457
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:48,140
be proper to do it in this working group

1458
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:49,820
but at this point it doesn't seem and I

1459
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:52,450
may be on this understanding milestones

1460
01:22:49,820 --> 01:22:54,620
Roman and you can you can tell me but I

1461
01:22:52,450 --> 01:22:55,700
don't know if it's a hard objective that

1462
01:22:54,620 --> 01:23:00,650
we need to meet in order to be

1463
01:22:55,700 --> 01:23:02,660
successful but it's I it was almost done

1464
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:03,460
at some point and why did we put it into

1465
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:07,000
a hole

1466
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:09,790
well it reached 90% done which means

1467
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,270
we're about 50% done with the work and

1468
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:15,010
getting that last 50% slowed down for a

1469
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:21,370
couple reasons

1470
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:23,350
I mean that's that's what I'll say about

1471
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:24,550
it is it's not a hard objective for the

1472
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:25,989
working group I don't think it means it

1473
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:28,390
doesn't need to get done to meet things

1474
01:23:25,989 --> 01:23:33,040
it's something that I'd like to see get

1475
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:34,420
done at some point I mean it wasn't

1476
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,769
something that was controversial it was

1477
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:38,230
just something that we sort of ran out

1478
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:40,360
of time and energy on I'm sure that's

1479
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:43,690
actually right yeah I think I'm still on

1480
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:46,269
right sorry Steven yes I think at some

1481
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:50,320
point we were actually on the hook to to

1482
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:52,030
write that that draft and you know we

1483
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,650
were overcome by events essentially

1484
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:56,769
which I know it might be a cop-out to

1485
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:59,739
send people but it does happen and then

1486
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:01,660
I think you had offered to kind of take

1487
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:03,400
it over but then obviously you've been

1488
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:06,160
busy with all the other things as well

1489
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:11,200
so you know some of these graphs I think

1490
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:13,690
are subject to you know simple capacity

1491
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:15,760
constraints at this point this happens

1492
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:18,219
to be one of them I think that ECP over

1493
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:20,380
transfer is another one because it at

1494
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:22,660
some point in the future once the

1495
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:25,810
architecture is baked enough and we have

1496
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:27,430
more time creepiness there I think it

1497
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:29,560
would be useful to have that draft and

1498
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:34,150
that would be something that I think CIS

1499
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:36,450
would consider contributing to you know

1500
01:24:34,150 --> 01:24:40,660
I can't say for sure but I think that's

1501
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:43,179
I don't know that's what I see so I'm

1502
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:46,960
thinking about it more I think that it's

1503
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:49,060
something that I could get back on the

1504
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,739
table get the because that we do have

1505
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:53,760
90% of the draft done so I could

1506
01:24:50,739 --> 01:24:56,139
resurrect that text get the draft

1507
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,730
unexpired and back up in our in our

1508
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:59,710
draft so that at least we can start

1509
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:01,690
talking about it during meetings and

1510
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:02,890
start soliciting feedback and seeing

1511
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:04,889
what people have to think about it and

1512
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:08,950
Adam and Bill I know you guys are busy

1513
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:10,540
so if it's here and sockem at least

1514
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:12,820
during the meetings we can talk about it

1515
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:16,290
and get some feedback and kind of hear

1516
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:19,349
some of the important stuff is with

1517
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:20,340
that'd be useful if it was a alive draft

1518
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:20,780
that we could talk about at the next

1519
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:28,140
meeting

1520
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:29,160
yes okay seesee enough me so yeah that

1521
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:30,660
works for me rhyme didn't you I just

1522
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,920
wanted to explain so you know the

1523
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:34,349
question was asked about what's the

1524
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:37,410
magic of milestones there's no magic two

1525
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:39,570
milestones generally working groups have

1526
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:41,400
a fixed scope and with that scope we

1527
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:43,410
understand what it takes to be done

1528
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,910
where groups are you've been you know

1529
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:46,680
for an indefinite period of time and so

1530
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:49,830
I've been using the milestones better to

1531
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:54,960
understand what it takes to be done and

1532
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:57,000
I just find again confusion as I kind of

1533
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,650
said where we have things in the distant

1534
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:03,140
past we're not sure what they are and we

1535
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:03,139
don't have I I haven't heard a plan I

1536
01:26:03,890 --> 01:26:09,180
mean we tried fairly hard and when we

1537
01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:12,240
wrote when we did the reach are during

1538
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:13,800
to put like I said milestones that

1539
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,030
people were committed to doing and that

1540
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:17,970
was the only thing that we put on there

1541
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:19,650
and not the aspirational things that

1542
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:22,500
people were saying we should do but the

1543
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:25,230
things that people wanted to do and

1544
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:26,970
that's why yeah some of the documents

1545
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:30,089
that had originally started in this were

1546
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:32,340
taken off the table so at least at a

1547
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:42,000
point two years ago people said they

1548
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:43,800
wanted to do these thank you so that

1549
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,320
brings us to the end of the milestone

1550
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:47,670
review the only last thing was is there

1551
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:51,750
any other business people want to bring

1552
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:53,640
up okay and then the last thing I had

1553
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:57,270
was a plan for between now and the next

1554
01:26:53,640 --> 01:27:00,750
meeting for for better or for worse this

1555
01:26:57,270 --> 01:27:03,750
is a working group that seems to drive

1556
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:08,180
to milestones drive to you like dates

1557
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:08,180
meeting dates and things like that so

1558
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:17,250
we've already discussed doing design

1559
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:22,500
team meetings driven by the authors of

1560
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:24,840
the architecture document would we like

1561
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:27,030
to have a virtual interim between now

1562
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,030
and then in addition to whatever the

1563
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:33,120
design team meetings

1564
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:33,120
into is that helpful

1565
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:44,740
Adam is nodding yes okay well why don't

1566
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:49,150
we target a virtual interim sometime in

1567
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:50,920
mid-january and we will do a doodle poll

1568
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:54,429
and see what we end up with with that

1569
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:56,770
all right excellent

1570
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:59,590
so with that thank you everybody and

1571
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:01,540
have a good rest of the day good night

1572
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:05,940

1573
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:09,280
evening and thank you for joining cool
