want to welcome you to the IETF 106 we

8
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:02,829
will be going through a lot of items

9
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:05,199

thanks alright so with that let's get to

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,369
the orders of business I don't think I'm

35
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,310
gonna read through the note well

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,420
everybody is aware do we have any new

37
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:28,180
attendees here Johanns good so you are

38
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,790
all well aware of the note well so we

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,250
can move on with respect to the

40
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,849
administrative tasks I believe I have a

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:42,959
couple of folks that voluntary volunteer

42
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:46,359
zero being one Oh Frank escaped so sad

43
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,099
can I have a second note-taker please

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,810
and the etherpad link is in the slides

45
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,560
so it would be good if we could have a

46
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,569
second one

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,910
I can't keep moving until I have a

48
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:03,399
second volunteer thank you Oh Frank

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,430
we'll be back and if just was that Mike

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,739
yeah just put your name on the I started

51
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,920
it and just add your name there is a

52
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:13,989
note-taker and I thank rich salts for

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,839
being our jabber scribe so with that

54
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:21,329
logistics under way let's get to the

55
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,329
agenda Bash so

56
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:38,900
got a love curl you know okay so with

57
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,930
that we had a very productive hackathon

58
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,319
this week and so Akira will be providing

59
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,480
that report and then Dave will spend the

60
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,000
rest of the time going through the

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,609
architecture so now that dave has

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,550
stepped down this chair you might have

63
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,010
seen the announcement that to help

64
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:00,110
expedite things

65
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,929
Dave is now also going to be a

66
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,950
contributing editor for the architecture

67
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,910
draft so any objections or items to add

68
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:13,700
to the agenda

69
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:18,709
oh you once going twice okay what's that

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:22,280
uh I wasn't going to because it's just

71
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:35,810
for today all right so with that I'm a

72
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:39,650
Curie you wanna we do have a few folks

73
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:46,669
on the meet echo as well so just let me

74
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:51,859
know since I'm running this solo hello

75
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:54,710
yeah just say that's for - yep it's a

76
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,169
hackathon report on Saturday Sunday and

77
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:03,130
most of the first half of the slide is

78
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:03,130
the same slide I used on Sunday report

79
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:25,879
I did yes yeah it's working so what

80
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:29,599
would plan it's in the slide so we make

81
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:32,119
me think main actually we did in a

82
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:37,520
hackathon this testing implementation of

83
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:41,689
our TRP over HTTP and and they when you

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,799
so Bassam brought the time and and David

85
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:47,270
also and I brought the teeth device

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,889
didn't know what to say for the tip

87
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,899
device so probably it's going to be

88
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:57,189
cheap device from now on and yeah little

89
00:05:53,899 --> 00:06:04,490
bit of a misspelling but um yeah all the

90
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:09,919
participants at the hackathon and yes so

91
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:13,399
this is the table and that you are

92
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:17,209
uploading able to uploading PA the

93
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:21,110
present application on the Tam and this

94
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:25,569
is the arm 64 bit actually it's cortex

95
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:29,629
a53 a core device with connecting with

96
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:32,949
PC to reboot in able to flash the

97
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:37,509
bootloader and Wireshark

98
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:43,009
the back printf debugging messaging etc

99
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:47,449
and yeah it's so long log

100
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:53,659
saying hello IETF t when after able to

101
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:58,959
install the ta on the OP T so what we

102
00:06:53,659 --> 00:07:03,620
learned is yes father issue with with

103
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:08,349
the HTTP there are three and D Protocol

104
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:10,279
draft and came up with a lot of

105
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:14,300
implementation action item for the

106
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:19,669
future yes my my knowledge of the IETF

107
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:24,050
in 2001 around 2001 is if any anything

108
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:26,060
is have UDP working was okay to do

109
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,740
something like RTP on top of it and

110
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,990
there was no operating system doesn't

111
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:34,639
speak UDP that time

112
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:36,740
but now for the water IP hackathon yeah

113
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,360
here is the filter consider what we need

114
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,759
but um so many things underneath must be

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,740
already working to make the or TRP t

116
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,900
working so that's something we learned

117
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:53,270
at the hackathon and something went well

118
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,940
is preparation from the beginning of a

119
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,448
Saturday without harming or disturbing

120
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:03,979
or making the RET if Network down we

121
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:07,250
were able to send so many a misspelling

122
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:10,219
or non know terminated packets on the

123
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:14,120
network and nothing went wrong only was

124
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,430
able to debug it and able to cross check

125
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,180
with the other implementation of a time

126
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,330
from the ISOBUS onsen tape that was my

127
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:27,800
and my device so I never connected other

128
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,889
than my fake time before and that the

129
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,450
future future considers and what we need

130
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:37,279
so we need we need to select if we going

131
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,070
to the hackathon and the future a more

132
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,588
productive to make it easier for the

133
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:48,170
implementation I only have five minutes

134
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:52,310
so we need to have at least what kind of

135
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:58,610
the hardware we use for the implementing

136
00:08:52,310 --> 00:09:02,149
and this starting to or TRP and keep on

137
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:05,000
top of the existing stack for we need

138
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:07,850
Jason's back HTTP stack encrypted stack

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,140
for tears and jw8 data where is working

140
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:16,060
and we need to see board to and why I'm

141
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,949
writing here is because the on Saturday

142
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:23,599
almost at the end of the Saturday I was

143
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:27,380
I was finished I was to debug the OTR P

144
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,370
packet on HTTP I end up debugging my

145
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,990
packet of the HTTP header is not

146
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,810
compliant and Jason parson is not

147
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,370
working and so I end up debugging the

148
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:43,300
under layer than in or DRP and deep

149
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:47,740
activity so this is my

150
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,560
now I have no I have no preference I

151
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,300
just list it up what what my mean need

152
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,750
to be considered and keep working group

153
00:09:52,300 --> 00:10:01,420
so refreshed time machine what is it

154
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:03,220
okay just you use a PC in your harder

155
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,260
hardware we would like to have other

156
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,560
than the time I really don't know and

157
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:11,920
the reference steep device deep device

158
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,930
in in the many different area it's

159
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,030
called IOT device for each device or

160
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:22,930
whatever it is from your background and

161
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:25,150
sin and for the arm property of the

162
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,209
usable devices properties the easiest

163
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:33,329
but I don't know it Raspberry Pi is the

164
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,480
right one or anything and Intel device

165
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,930
SDX

166
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,180
usable device yes and it would be nice

167
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,959
if it's there's something other than

168
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,870
laptop PC and risk v is there's only one

169
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,880
board exists at the moment and that's

170
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,570
already have a PNP X station which is

171
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,410
kind of similar to on process zone but

172
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:59,200
different way of implementing and and

173
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,030
unless they have a question yeah I I

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,810
think that's a good question also in

175
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:06,490
light of the hackathon in in February I

176
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,589
looked at some of their devices and

177
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,030
maybe they will have some photo

178
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,410
recommendations but a device that I

179
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,180
recently looked at which I thought was

180
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,640
really cool that we could make use of

181
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,170
for future for future events and people

182
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,980
who want to play around with this stuff

183
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:23,229
is it's a device recently released by

184
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,810
STMicroelectronics called stm32 mp1 I

185
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,190
can send a link to the list and I looked

186
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,119
in the trust zone implementation which

187
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,760
also comes with opti and it's it it's

188
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,730
also has an m-class process on on on a

189
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,410
device which really really looks like a

190
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:47,230
rock-solid nice device to play with

191
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:49,630
thank you is that a protects a okay take

192
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:52,350
ever since harness basically asked me to

193
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:55,720
make some recommendation the other

194
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,720
device that we use for testing that I

195
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,550
would recommend

196
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,400
as probably more security features in

197
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:05,630
the raspberry pi 3 is also a cortex a53

198
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,160
and so NXP there's a board from

199
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,290
scaleless it's called the great board

200
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,030
that is what is used in a commercial

201
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,349
product called the trust box from

202
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,750
scaleless and that's the one that got

203
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,910
like the CES cybersecurity Innovation

204
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,220
Award this last year and so that's

205
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,770
another one that actually has a box

206
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,120
let's say no industrial box that goes

207
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,400
around it but you can just use the great

208
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,780
board let's do the Raspberry Pi 3 so I'd

209
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:33,140
be their piece of hardware that might be

210
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:37,699
useful thank you and another thing is

211
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:41,770
software stack on Tam saw on the town

212
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:46,340
side it's pretty much as a regular PC

213
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:51,410
laptop not laptop server up set up so it

214
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:54,560
Apache nodejs crypto open SSL or some

215
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,000
variant but probably it's okay and I'm

216
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,579
not sure what seaboard parser will be

217
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,050
recommended we might need to come up

218
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,190
with it and the tip device yes so the

219
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:10,930
cheek devices

220
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:14,240
it's supposed to be limited hardware

221
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:18,620
capability easiest ways to do it is a

222
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,570
user PC even on a teep teep device but

223
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,020
um other than that we need to think

224
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:28,100
about the root of s build root actually

225
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:31,040
or open wrt otherwise putting on the

226
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,880
HTTP taxation stack and crypto stack

227
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,969
will be depend on the root of s and

228
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,360
there's so many selection on the crypto

229
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,450
library open SSL the bare SSL

230
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:50,360
organizational and bacterias offices and

231
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:53,990
s2 in and open SSL variant it tends to

232
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,780
be very large for the cheap device so

233
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:00,589
probably we need something think about

234
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,339
something smaller stack and we also need

235
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,910
a seaport

236
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:07,279
parser we need somebody to do the C or

237
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:10,219
parser here

238
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,189
and I'm not sure this is the scope of

239
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:18,040
the tip working good but um something

240
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:21,620
came up during the hackathon is yes if

241
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,889
having a test fit on the Internet

242
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:28,579
so I have a time and everybody able to

243
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:31,819
talk on the time with a deep device then

244
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:33,829
you could do the hacker a hackathon

245
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:40,149
preparation before you coming at the

246
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:43,309
table and the IE development so the te

247
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:46,610
program and the T and the previous site

248
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:51,290
I was using printf so think of debugging

249
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:53,420
is at the moment is the most used way on

250
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:57,079
the trusted application devoting which

251
00:14:53,420 --> 00:15:01,128
is not that productive and so yes

252
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:05,059
opening clave is IDE development

253
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:11,180
environment and yes I haven't tried it

254
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:14,870
on the my opti device so and in the

255
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:17,359
future so we get have a github for the

256
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:20,990
hosting input reference implementation

257
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,589
then the person who doesn't have a just

258
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:27,199
try out or once the type deep dive the

259
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:31,970
rscd draft then able to see the

260
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:34,219
implementation and what kind also the DT

261
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:38,050
requires the hardware support so tan

262
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:41,329
sorry what kind of hardware we might

263
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:44,500
might good to have or antique device

264
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:49,670
side what what yes what else we might

265
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:51,319
good to have is something so those are

266
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,479
good questions a cure I would encourage

267
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,550
you to post them on the teet male group

268
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,519
alright so we already have for the

269
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,859
documents at github a teep organization

270
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,620
so if people are willing to volunteer

271
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,769
and put code there we can certainly open

272
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:10,610
up a repository there mm-hmm

273
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:13,540
and yes this is my notes for the my deep

274
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,889
device I had the more detailed technical

275
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,310
description but um yes

276
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:21,420
if you being something

277
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:24,069
it you learn a lot so everybody

278
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:29,199
encouraged to participating deep

279
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:29,529
partisan and well yes that's it thank

280
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,979
you

281
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:35,759
and tomorrow Hannes will speak speaking

282
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:40,930
for a couple minutes on another planned

283
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:43,629
hackathon coming up in February so okay

284
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,309
thank you thank you any questions for

285
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:52,949
Akira

286
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:52,949
no okay thank you Dave you are up

287
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:08,470
I gotta do this magic try this liquor I

288
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:11,500
might have to do it boys okay

289
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,780
so when I spend some time going through

290
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,750
the issues filed against the

291
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,369
architecture documents I'm I go through

292
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,470
almost everything there's a couple

293
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,948
issues that I think are just editorial

294
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,240
that don't need discussion but almost

295
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:28,449
everything I'm going to cover three I'm

296
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,419
gonna cover here all right so I've got a

297
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:36,640
slide or two on every issue that is

298
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:40,390
worth discussing and so my actually back

299
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,450
up for a second the goal is to try to

300
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:45,340
have the editors have an idea of what

301
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,100
the working group wants the resolution

302
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,449
to an issue to be such that if the text

303
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,129
isn't there we at least know what the

304
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,919
intent is and we can go and author that

305
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,100
in the next Rev such that the next Rev

306
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,230
of the document should ideally cover

307
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,178
some answer to every issue which

308
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,530
hopefully reflects working consensus so

309
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,870
that we can then verify whether we got

310
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,090
it right okay so I want to actually have

311
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,189
enough information for the editors to

312
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,570
know what to do with each issue some

313
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,669
things we actually have proposed text

314
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,580
for a lot of them we don't and so I'll

315
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:16,809
ask the questions and get the opinion of

316
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,949
the working group so that we know what

317
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:23,980
to do there Thanks all right the first

318
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,840
one was I think you can see for each of

319
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,840
these they have the github issue number

320
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,000
you can see this one is issue number 69

321
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:35,439
separately it was also part of issue

322
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,270
number 70 Jurgen Center a review to the

323
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,640
list that included a bunch of things

324
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,350
from editorial knits all the way up to

325
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,030
questions and so some of those are

326
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,428
covering other slides you see number 70

327
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,750
number of times in these okay so 69 is

328
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,150
the one that pulls out specifically this

329
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,850
question should the architecture

330
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,830
document use normative language current

331
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,290
status is that the draft by the way is

332
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,730
intended says of informational but it

333
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:03,100
does use terms and from RFC 21 19 okay

334
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,470
so we can first confirm should it be

335
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,090
informational or stay no track right my

336
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,860
understanding from what the chairs

337
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,780
believed that it should be informational

338
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,610
correct I think our Charter milestone

339
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,668
actually says that it's information and

340
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,949
so the answer there is

341
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:18,480
it should be informational but the

342
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,119
charter doesn't actually say whether we

343
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,309
need to use 2119 language or not and

344
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,769
currently the architecture document does

345
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:27,239
include some terms in various places and

346
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:30,659
I'll show you some examples on the next

347
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:34,580
slide and so if it should use any of

348
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:37,080
those then should the audience be

349
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,730
implementers in other words those are

350
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,199
conformance things that an implementer

351
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,899
writes code that conforms to a

352
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,109
particular must should or may or is it

353
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:49,139
for our spec writers like the authors of

354
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:52,340
the tea protocol spec okay or you know

355
00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:55,469
if spec routers which specs and so a

356
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,080
proposal for your feedback is that it

357
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,539
stays informational and we could remove

358
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,949
the 2119 terms whether you like that

359
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:04,919
proposal or not so let's look at some

360
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,720
examples this is not the complete list

361
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,169
but the point is the spec right now

362
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,759
includes some uses of language that is

363
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:14,700
directed at spec writers and so you can

364
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:17,460
see three examples there I'm talking

365
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,590
about what goes in and it says ot RP

366
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,419
protocol right you'd imagine the T

367
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,970
protocol here's what the other protocol

368
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:27,119
document shall do okay these are

369
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:28,769
examples of normative language and so we

370
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,928
could either keep this language or we

371
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,190
could just not use 2119 language since

372
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,850
you could say the same thing in english

373
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,350
text and there's also other statements

374
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,178
that are directed at implementers like

375
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,928
the examples on the bottom okay

376
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:44,789
so for example the tam should use a crl

377
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,830
or whatever to validate certificates

378
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:48,929
that type of statement okay is in the

379
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,178
architecture document right now okay

380
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,649
such statements could be moved to the

381
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,149
protocol document if we think there

382
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:55,799
needs to be normative text that's there

383
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,229
and those in theory could move to say

384
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,269
the tea protocol spec okay so the

385
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,710
question here is what do we want the

386
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:04,019
architecture document to be you should

387
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,960
have any of these uses or should all of

388
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:09,119
these be removed in terms of 2119

389
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,600
language and just have informative text

390
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:15,119
okay you can see right now as an editor

391
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,209
I would propose to remove those terms

392
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,289
and just use English text but if there

393
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,999
are people in the working group that

394
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:22,769
would object to that or think those need

395
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:27,280
to stay there then this is your time to

396
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:29,740
say that so my suggests

397
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,260
is to put this on the email list just to

398
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:35,320
confirm right yeah we can do that for

399
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:38,350
all of these but yeah okay so here my

400
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,240
proposal is we remove the 2119 language

401
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,899
from the document and use English text

402
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,690
but Honus yeah I agree with you I think

403
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,950
those uh I don't know I don't know how

404
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,010
about the history is why we got that

405
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,660
India but it feels a little bit of a for

406
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:56,230
an architecture document in my opinion

407
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,950
um so I think there's no harm in in

408
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,600
change Cheney to lowercase and then

409
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,930
actually revisiting some of the details

410
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,110
because they may as well better fit into

411
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,520
the protocol document to be honest some

412
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,350
of the statements as you will see

413
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,990
actually are in sections that might be

414
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,189
removed due to a leader issue because

415
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,560
the architecture document was written

416
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,610
prior to the time where the t p--

417
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,370
working group decided to take a

418
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:24,459
dependency on suit for manifest stuff

419
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:25,510
and on rats for attestation stuff you

420
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,040
can see some of these normative

421
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,060
statements or an attestation stuff that

422
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,350
might actually not belong in the

423
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,940
document anymore or depending so that's

424
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,320
a later issue I'll get to you okay so

425
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,300
don't pay too much attention the actual

426
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,790
literal examples on here but there's a

427
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,419
lot more than just these five on the

428
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,920
screen right now all right so hearing no

429
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:44,350
objections to that proposed I'm going to

430
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,460
go on and well again send the lists and

431
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,310
stuff to the list in case those

432
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,590
objections in the list okay now we get

433
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,659
into some terminology ones and most the

434
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,580
terminology ones I left on the editorial

435
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,370
stuff but the first two I think are

436
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,870
really about scoping and so I call these

437
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,229
out this is a slightly easier one

438
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:04,179
there's three issues about terminology

439
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,570
about the stuff that's outside the t ee

440
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:11,290
and the problem was as a number of

441
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,030
issues got filed is that the same thing

442
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,010
it had multiple terms for it in

443
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,480
different places in the document things

444
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,160
like some places it was called an

445
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,390
untrusted application in other places it

446
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,540
was a client application but they both

447
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,250
meant the same thing or what you call

448
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,960
the richer the operating system and the

449
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,070
rich execution environment a bunch of

450
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,650
different terms that all meant the same

451
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,679
thing okay and so here you can see in

452
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,360
there's a plural quest that I didn't

453
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,130
merge because I wasn't a chair before

454
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,379
but I submitted the pull request sorry

455
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,240
because I was a not a document editor

456
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,080
before now that I'm a document editor I

457
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,930
am free to merge

458
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,850
them but the tea process is that editors

459
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,160
merge and chairs closed the github

460
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,500
issues okay and so now that I am an

461
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,170
editor and not a chair that means I can

462
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,430
now merge but not close the issues where

463
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,660
before I could close the issues when

464
00:23:54,430 --> 00:24:01,390
that merge okay so that's how it works

465
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:03,250
in tea okay so the term between client

466
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,990
application and untrusted application in

467
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,300
the pull request I chose untrusted

468
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,040
application which avoids confusion with

469
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,290
cases where you have server applications

470
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,460
like I have an HTTP server or something

471
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,290
else as a server for pick your favorite

472
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,640
protocol and the term client could be

473
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,899
confusing because it's the server side

474
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,900
of some protocol right so untrusted

475
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,970
application was unambiguous and so there

476
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,800
you can see depending on the context in

477
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,140
some cases rich execution environment

478
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,399
makes sense and in other cases the file

479
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,260
where I don't know who filed this one

480
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,820
suggested commodity operating system and

481
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,870
so I took that in one of the case in one

482
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:36,700
of the cases because we're it was

483
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:38,800
talking about that alright I'm gonna go

484
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,920
on since that one that one is the this

485
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,540
is the one that's actually closer to a

486
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,870
scoping question what's the definition

487
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,700
of a t'ee okay that's where we provision

488
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:50,080
t e's in this working group right this

489
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,500
is the te provisioning working group we

490
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,330
provision te so what's it te so

491
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,750
previously what do you have in the

492
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,189
document is that quote an execution

493
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,370
environment that runs alongside uh but

494
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:05,500
as isolated from an ree the filer picked

495
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,300
on the word isolated because the filer I

496
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,010
don't ever follow that said well maybe I

497
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,450
admit to them that they couldn't

498
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,250
communicate between each other but here

499
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,580
they can so they suggest that maybe

500
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:18,430
separated and then there's a bunch of

501
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:21,870
other discussions in issue number 68 and

502
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:24,160
so an example is can you have tes that

503
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,600
don't have any rich execution

504
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,490
environment on the same device right

505
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,590
Hannes mention an ST micro for example

506
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,240
an MCU class thing can you have the

507
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,439
entire thing via te and still call it a

508
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,150
te ok so that's what I have on the next

509
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,230
slide here so feel free to get up to the

510
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,870
mic but wait till I get to the next

511
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:42,490
slide so I tried to generate a pull

512
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:46,120
request for how I might try to resolve

513
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:50,020
this although this one overlaps with so

514
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:51,610
here's poor request 71 so 71 had my

515
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,889
definition pulled from other places

516
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,119
which you may agree or disagree with but

517
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,909
it was

518
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,619
say our both charter discussion slides

519
00:25:57,909 --> 00:26:02,710
at one point and so it's not new to the

520
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:04,988
working group which is anything that

521
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:08,109
provides hardware enforcement that these

522
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:09,940
two properties are true right only

523
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:11,769
prevents unauthorized code from

524
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,269
executing I'm just rephrasing what's on

525
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:14,649
the slide here and that it prevents

526
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,629
tampering with by stuff that's outside

527
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:17,918
right so that's one definition that's

528
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:19,570
different from the definition up there

529
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,190
so we could adopt this okay

530
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:26,559
and so the scoping questions are does a

531
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:30,399
te necessarily have to have an ree on

532
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,649
the same device or not hey if it's not

533
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:34,359
you call that not a te I would be

534
00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:35,649
inclined to say yes you could have a te

535
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,369
that does not have an hour EE on the

536
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:43,418
same device there was some discussion in

537
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:45,249
the issue about referencing a trusted OS

538
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:47,289
and I think honest you had a comment or

539
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:49,539
something about that an issue and so

540
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:51,369
some T's have a trusted OS like trust

541
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:53,950
zone would like opti as an example a

542
00:26:51,369 --> 00:26:56,199
trusted OS some like SGX do not have a

543
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,899
trusted OS so as long as you believe

544
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,960
that SGX is at te then it does not have

545
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:03,279
to have a trusted OS well even in my

546
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,080
definition on the previous one you saw

547
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,299
hardware enforcement so the scoping

548
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,678
question is well what if you don't have

549
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:10,720
hardware enforcement what if you just

550
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,269
have enforcement by say a hypervisor do

551
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,039
you call that a te can you use the t p--

552
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:16,690
protocol to provision something which

553
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,629
isn't Hardware back that suddenly say

554
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,070
hypervisor pact what's the scope of the

555
00:27:19,629 --> 00:27:26,168
architecture right so this is actually a

556
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:27,789
more a more central question right and

557
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:29,350
so I went back to the teach charter to

558
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:32,200
say how does the T charter define it

559
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:34,230
right and so I quoted the key parts of

560
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,230
the cheap charter for your information

561
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:40,899
here it calls a te a secure area of a

562
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,460
processor which while that definition

563
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:44,918
kind of implies hardware but is that

564
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,710
what we want talks about isolated

565
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,179
execution in integrity and

566
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,549
confidentiality kind of overlap so the

567
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:54,249
definition of the previous slide and

568
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:55,869
then talks about in general terms an

569
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:57,700
execution space it provides a higher

570
00:27:55,869 --> 00:27:58,928
level of security than a rich operating

571
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,830
system and more functionality than

572
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,419
secure list those are kind of

573
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:04,418
definitional thoughts and there's some

574
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:06,429
examples and none of those actually

575
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:08,470
specifically answer the question of

576
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:10,240
whether hardware based stuff

577
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:12,520
inherent to the definition of a tae

578
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,169
other than maybe the secured area the

579
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,150
processor could and so the real view of

580
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:17,559
the question is and we want the

581
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,880
architecture document we want to

582
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:20,830
constrain the architecture to

583
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,230
exclusively call out that you must have

584
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:30,699
and the team must be backed by hardware

585
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:35,429
or do we want a software definition so I

586
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:39,250
I think I erased the issue because

587
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:40,960
obviously we want to be inclusive in the

588
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,450
definition and people don't want to be

589
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,520
we can have examples in there for some

590
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:47,559
of the popular things but I thought it

591
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:53,460
would be important specifically for the

592
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:56,408
types of attacks we want to make the

593
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:00,460
reader way off and specifically like the

594
00:28:56,409 --> 00:29:02,190
definition the main definition already

595
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,470
includes sort of the distinction between

596
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,419
this one an execution environment that

597
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:09,490
the runs alongside but it's isolated

598
00:29:07,419 --> 00:29:11,980
from the re so did you at least have a

599
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,870
distinction between sort of the the

600
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,390
normal world where a regular operating

601
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:18,100
system runs and and the de part so you

602
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,950
have that so that the normal word

603
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,719
callously can't access the de site

604
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,880
memory of course their difference is

605
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,700
that because some of the brick and some

606
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,620
of the DES don't provide or extend the

607
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,780
protection or the way to peripherals but

608
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:34,149
only focus on memory that's a would be a

609
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:38,260
distinction between I'm Trustin and and

610
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:40,799
Intel SGX um however I also think it's

611
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,330
important to highlight that we

612
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,360
specifically with the dynamic uploading

613
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,649
installation and management of trusted

614
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,139
applications we also want to make sure

615
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:53,080
that the das themself are isolated from

616
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:59,340
each other and the das are not able to

617
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:01,750
access sort of memory data that is

618
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,879
essentially running at a higher

619
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,250
privilege level like if in trust zone

620
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,990
case it can't access the operator

621
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,669
operating system underneath so there's

622
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,860
additional protection capabilities there

623
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:13,900
and I think the only way to get those

624
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,459
protection capability is true some

625
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,679
hardware enforcement that I consider

626
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,539
hypervisor hypervisor also Hardware

627
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,360
enforcement technique because they are

628
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:25,060
um ultimately they are

629
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,429
we're mechanisms but and that's where I

630
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,720
think the chart the definition for is a

631
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,790
little bit short he talks about the

632
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,510
processor in specifically in a te con

633
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:36,310
and I'm trusts on context it's it's not

634
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,890
enough to just look at the single

635
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,710
processor you actually have to think of

636
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,600
it as a system concept a cooperation

637
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,690
between software and hardware extends to

638
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,389
the whole thing because as you make

639
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,680
memory access you need to be aware that

640
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:52,300
there's a bus and there are different

641
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,130
peripherals on that bus and I thought

642
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,530
the peripherals like DMA controller can

643
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:58,540
access that the memory regions they made

644
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,350
shows PI pass all these things if you're

645
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,610
not super careful so I maybe that goes a

646
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,689
little bit too far for this type of

647
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:09,610
document but I think there's also for

648
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:12,490
the readers who may not be so familiar

649
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:15,850
before the different fine nuances of the

650
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:18,340
different DS they they probably should

651
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:21,820
be aware of what's going on terrifying

652
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,260
question so first of all wait for

653
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:24,550
anybody that comes to the mic if you can

654
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,680
say whether you like any of these

655
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,120
definitions that I've shown or if you

656
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:30,070
like none of the above or something else

657
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,459
but you've made a specific point about

658
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,110
isolation between TAS do you believe

659
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,000
that that is part of the definition of

660
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,679
at EEE such that something that doesn't

661
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,390
do that is not a te or do you think

662
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,740
that's just a property that some have so

663
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,510
for example if I have a secure element

664
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,160
that supports one security domain and I

665
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:52,180
can put any number of TAS in it what you

666
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:54,700
call it not at EEE because it medium

667
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,920
properties at the bottom yeah and so

668
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,940
that's my definitional question so i up

669
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,770
in the top here those different

670
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,990
properties isolation between two TAS

671
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,490
running in the same environment you

672
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,960
consider that to be a definition of a

673
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:08,080
tea or just a property that some have

674
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
and some don't like an OS yeah I just

675
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,610
want to sort of a maybe we need to talk

676
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,680
about this aspect a little bit more in

677
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,310
the security consideration section is by

678
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,900
the fact that we provide some add some

679
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,030
dynamic nature with the work we are

680
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:26,230
doing with this dynamic provisioning we

681
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:29,500
are suddenly also to a certain extent

682
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:30,910
creating new attack possibilities that

683
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,400
didn't exist previously where everything

684
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:35,590
was sort of nailed down and static in

685
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,190
terms of what code run is running on the

686
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:39,310
secure

687
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,670
and so I think we have to take that into

688
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,800
account

689
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,380
I don't think existing definitions focus

690
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,100
too much on the isolation between TAS

691
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,900
actually while I believe if you want to

692
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,330
go as far as saying that there are

693
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,810
multiple parties on the or multiple

694
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:58,449
authors of software now pushing code

695
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:00,480
into the under de and in form of trusted

696
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:03,190
applications that there needs to be some

697
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,650
isolation mechanism whether that's

698
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,720
provided by the operating system under

699
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:10,240
on the REE site or whether some other

700
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,190
techniques like in SGX that some I think

701
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,830
that's a secondary aspect but I think

702
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,630
it's worth highlighting that in in for

703
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:19,000
someone who wants to use such a system

704
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:21,700
so I but I heard you say I'm gonna try

705
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,620
to summarize that in one phrase that was

706
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,120
a long elaborate the bottom line that I

707
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,260
heard was you think it should be a

708
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,000
library around in the security

709
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,710
considered security consideration

710
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,270
section as opposed to the definition of

711
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:39,640
a te ok Lawrence slim blade let me ask a

712
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:44,200
I'm not a hardcore tea person but let me

713
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,790
ask a teep is a protocol right it is now

714
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,890
it's what you're doing is defining a

715
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:49,600
protocol previously we had an OT RP

716
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:52,960
protocol we now have a tea protocol I

717
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,060
didn't before so it seemed to me that

718
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,960
you're defining a protocol you're not

719
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:00,790
trying to make security guarantees or

720
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,230
describe a security architecture for

721
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,020
somebody implementing an operating

722
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:08,199
system in some place like te e or

723
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:11,679
something like that that is correct the

724
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:13,239
topic here is you can think of this part

725
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,250
of the architecture document that's

726
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,859
defining a te as being almost like an

727
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,989
applicability statement for the protocol

728
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,910
yes and that's what it should be is an

729
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:25,870
applicability statement that guides what

730
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:28,779
you do right so it says it's applicable

731
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,639
to te es and so what's a te e is

732
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,060
basically saying what the clickability

733
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:37,600
scope is yeah so I mean I don't think I

734
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:40,029
like any of your definitions because

735
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,199
they're starting to try to you know

736
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,760
they're saying there's something magic

737
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,100
are special about the security of what

738
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,770
you're doing and I don't think that that

739
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:49,549
this protocol really depends on any of

740
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,639
that I would I would imagine

741
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:57,110
so I don't think it matters that from I

742
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,180
would it does depend on the properties

743
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,800
down below I would argue so there's

744
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,089
elements in the protocol that depends on

745
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,070
on those things as an individual that is

746
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:10,130
my interpretation of the protocol yes I

747
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:14,780
don't know if Hannes has okay so I don't

748
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:16,760
go on too long here um but it just seems

749
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,020
like they're talking too much about

750
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,470
security characteristics of an

751
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,420
implementation and but this is not about

752
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,399
the implementation of the protocol this

753
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:27,860
is about the protocol is applicable to

754
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,120
implementations of hardware or

755
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,190
environments that have the following

756
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,200
properties if you meet these it's saying

757
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,940
this protocol is applicable to you but

758
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,819
it's not about how you implement the

759
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:41,150
protocol okay let me let me get trained

760
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,250
another way here um what I mean you

761
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,960
could use the T protocol just fine if

762
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,850
you didn't meet like number one down

763
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,700
there if let's say on authorize code

764
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:53,839
could act could execute you okay sure so

765
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,520
Ben K Tech sorry to Jim and I think

766
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,220
maybe learns what you're saying is that

767
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,890
there's a question between do you want

768
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,080
the decision of applicability being made

769
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:05,150
by the person who would be deploying it

770
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:12,440
or the person who would be defining the

771
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:13,760
protocol yes you're right the protocol

772
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,500
could be used by things it's not

773
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,820
applicable for that's true for just

774
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,990
about any protocol you can use it for

775
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,390
things that it wasn't designed for this

776
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,439
is saying it's a design space Satanas

777
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:27,980
yeah I think to me it makes a lot of

778
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,710
sense to provide more background

779
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,630
information and more context in an

780
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,720
architecture document and to explain a

781
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:38,450
little bit what the anticipated

782
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,540
deployment environment is but agree of

783
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,700
course at the protocol level itself you

784
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,710
know like you could run it locally like

785
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,600
two scripts talking to each other and

786
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,120
using the protocol a day the protocol

787
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,040
doesn't wouldn't care much but I think

788
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,170
for the architecture which is this

789
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,180
discussion I think providing that extra

790
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:01,720
content context is actually quite

791
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,720
valuable because there is a lot of

792
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,940
technology context and history around

793
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:09,750
TSD is that you need to understand in

794
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:13,810
order to use them properly it's not just

795
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:15,250
fall out of thin air it's the same as

796
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,390
with at the station like think of you

797
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,640
could think of the at the station

798
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,170
working as a JSON document and you can

799
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,810
use JSON documents in all sorts of

800
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:25,180
contexts but then that there's this

801
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:28,900
whole architecture around how people use

802
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:32,259
attestation and sort of like what

803
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:38,050
systems you want to utilize if it is

804
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:39,760
it's obviously more complex like in the

805
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:41,740
attestation I mean I've been arguing all

806
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,480
along in attestation that attestation

807
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,770
should be able to run in an unsecured

808
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,690
android app or it should be running in

809
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:49,390
the secure element and and we don't we

810
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:51,160
all of those are in scope and we in

811
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,690
attestation we don't care we were just

812
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,660
defining a protocol that's you do what

813
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:58,840
you want right so um so to me it would

814
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:01,569
be the t p-- Chartres is narrower okay

815
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,670
perhaps but I mean any any I just get

816
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,950
suspicious anytime you're trying to say

817
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:08,260
something about the security environment

818
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,250
of the you know when you're defining a

819
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,050
protocol when you're trying to talk

820
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,670
about the security in the environment

821
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,970
that it runs in is seems like an

822
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:17,470
overreach overstep to me so I'm gonna

823
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,200
end there with one more comment and that

824
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:22,060
is in in phyto we defined what it was

825
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,430
called an ro a restricted operating

826
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:28,150
environment as a sort of a broader thing

827
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:30,460
that covers tes and sgx and VBS and

828
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,200
somebody that just saw there's a really

829
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,940
nice CPU somewhere on the board that's

830
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,160
got its isolated or something like that

831
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:40,690
so we used we just use the term ROA

832
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:44,009
instead of thought EE sure yeah there's

833
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,010
a nice document and all that normative

834
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:54,609
Ben will you in line okay so one of the

835
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,250
things that I've heard so far is that

836
00:38:54,609 --> 00:38:59,560
there's some discussion that belongs in

837
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,730
the security consideration section and I

838
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,470
don't know if it's in there or not that

839
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,710
Hannes was summarizing right some

840
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:07,209
expectations around tes and discussion

841
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,060
of isolation and things like that that

842
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:11,619
would make sense to have some place if

843
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,109
that's not part of the definition then

844
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:15,460
we still need to cover the definition

845
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:17,319
and as I mentioned there are two

846
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,170
problems that people race with the

847
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:23,410
original definition in the document and

848
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,820
so I guess my question is if there's

849
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,170
appropriate text that gets put in

850
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,810
security considerations and elsewhere

851
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:32,099
then are there any objections to the

852
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:32,099
definition on the bottom of the slide

853
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,220
with appropriate other text that goes

854
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,530
elsewhere about the different

855
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:41,078
constraints and different variations of

856
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,970
tes are there any objections to having

857
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:45,040
the text on the bottom be the definition

858
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:48,250
of a te that this working group uses as

859
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,509
the definition of all te es or all

860
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,190
things that we're talking about is te

861
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:54,069
would fit this and there's various

862
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,859
variations among them if there's no

863
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:59,980
objections I will go ahead and merge

864
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:02,940
that one and continue to work on text

865
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:07,890
about isolation and so on

866
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:10,180
text suggestions welcome rich rich Sol's

867
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:12,790
authorized code is that to be defined

868
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,169
later or explicitly not to be defined it

869
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,060
is actually defined in the guy is

870
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,440
defined in the document by a code that

871
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,290
is authorized by the device

872
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,890
administrator meaning then there's

873
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:25,329
actually a that part nobody is yet

874
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,520
raised that the text in the document is

875
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:32,589
unclear maybe it is but nobody is yet

876
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:36,040
said that so I'm sorry to interject here

877
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:38,109
Dave Gary Monday I'm Qualcomm I'm when I

878
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,450
was looking through this document while

879
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:43,328
revising the security consideration

880
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,578
section I had a lot of trouble here from

881
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:48,369
trying to figure out what how ta - ta

882
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:50,619
isolation is handled in this document -

883
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:52,960
nice in this definition really muddy

884
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:54,790
muddy is it for me because it does it I

885
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,849
mean because you're you're basically

886
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,800
saying that only authorized Q can

887
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,840
execute within the te day

888
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,350
used by that code can be read or

889
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:08,320
tampered with my coat outside of the TE

890
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:09,670
but we need that that we need that we

891
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,160
need a similar requirement for the code

892
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,840
within the TE as well that ta - ta

893
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,970
isolation that was the question I was

894
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,950
asking Hannes is if you have something

895
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,109
like a secure element that supports one

896
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,850
security domain that supports multiple

897
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:27,630
TAS in there are you saying that is not

898
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,630
a te e because

899
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,390
II and they even use the term te e

900
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,040
because if it does it doesn't provide

901
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:38,140
isolation within a security domain only

902
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,579
between security domains so yeah I'm

903
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:44,558
okay either way I'm just saying I'm

904
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:47,260
asking you what you're arguing so so I

905
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,670
don't know I think when I looked at in

906
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,559
the context of attestation I was

907
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,849
thinking example for two TAS are

908
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:54,220
providing two separate attestation

909
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:56,740
services to the rich execution

910
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:59,200
environment those two TAS should be

911
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,629
those two th at each other it should

912
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,578
form their own trust domains sorry I I

913
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,670
realized I phrased my question wrong

914
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:09,220
because it if it only has one security

915
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,260
domain it probably is not a te a better

916
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,790
way to phrase the question is the

917
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,869
concept of a security domain which has

918
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,180
covered a different issue I'll have a

919
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:18,280
later slide on okay is where you have

920
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,450
multiple TAS in a secure domain you can

921
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,859
have multiple security domains you know

922
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,390
zero moron on device right

923
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:23,558
there's isolation between security

924
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:27,250
domains but within a security domain

925
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:29,260
there's not isolation between TAS and so

926
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,240
just saying every TA is isolated from

927
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,650
every other TA ignores the concept of a

928
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,759
security domain that says I would like

929
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,250
some assuring that doesn't have

930
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,839
isolation between this little set fair

931
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,400
enough if you can do it and you can

932
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,190
define a security domain to be on with

933
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,020
one ta potentially and that is the

934
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:45,760
normal case and that the document does

935
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,319
say that although we'll get to the

936
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,240
security domain issues later on okay

937
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:53,740
thanks so feel free to jump back up with

938
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,419
the mic when we talk about security

939
00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:03,189
domains which is coming up soon all

940
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:05,380
right all right I know they'll try to

941
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,619
group a set of issues to the things that

942
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,089
are relevant to the suit working group

943
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:11,470
followed by another section of issues

944
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:15,910
that are things relevant to the rats

945
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:17,439
working group okay Oh at the very end by

946
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,690
a couple things that are two more

947
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,579
agnostic it means not specific to either

948
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,930
okay so now we're in the section if you

949
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:24,910
are here from the suit working group but

950
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:27,549
I saw my suit coach here come in a

951
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:32,230
minute ago and sit down so thank you all

952
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:34,540
right remember the architecture document

953
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:35,650
was previously written before the or the

954
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,849
text that's in there was written before

955
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,250
the work group decided to take a

956
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:40,359
dependency on the suit manifest so

957
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,349
there's some text in there that's

958
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:42,549
obsolete or

959
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:45,839
perhaps needs to change in some other

960
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:50,440
way and so here are three related issues

961
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:53,650
13 34 or 35 that are all kind of about

962
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,499
how you deal with dependencies either on

963
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:59,710
TAS say you know a untrusted application

964
00:43:56,499 --> 00:44:01,269
depends on a TA or a TA depends on

965
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,489
something like this TA depends on that

966
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:05,979
TA or this TA depends on this version of

967
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:07,539
a trusted OS or this version this TA

968
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:09,249
depends on this version of trusted

969
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:10,420
firmware or whatever expressing

970
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:12,549
dependencies in general that's what

971
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,739
these three issues are right the bottom

972
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:16,869
one is dependencies on a TA other ones

973
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:19,539
are dependencies from a TA actually the

974
00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:22,390
bottom two are dependencies on TAS and

975
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:24,609
the top one is dependencies from a TA so

976
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:26,558
we had working group consensus in teep

977
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:31,420
to use the suit manifest for

978
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:33,400
dependencies from TAS okay suit manifest

979
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,170
describes all the TA particular TA and

980
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,380
everything it depends on okay that's

981
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:40,630
separate from a normal client or sorry

982
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,430
an untrusted application manifest it's

983
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,599
the manifest from it that comes from or

984
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,859
maybe is used with your favorite app

985
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,430
store or whatever that's not the suit

986
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:46,808
manifest

987
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,839
that's just whatever you're already

988
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:51,609
using in your app store and so the text

989
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,529
already has the draft already has some

990
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:55,719
text talking about the untrusted apps

991
00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:57,009
manifest which is not a suit manifest

992
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:59,109
rights whatever manifest is they're

993
00:44:57,009 --> 00:45:02,859
using now that can express dependencies

994
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:05,549
on TAS but all the other issues are

995
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:09,788
about expressing dependencies from TAS

996
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:14,049
okay so I generated a pull request with

997
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:16,359
a strawman and the summary of that is to

998
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:18,420
add a reference to the suit manifest as

999
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:21,880
it's now a in the references section and

1000
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,769
explain that the suit manifest is what

1001
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,359
expresses dependencies from TA so

1002
00:45:23,769 --> 00:45:27,339
everything at EA depends on whether it's

1003
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,979
other TA whether it's in a trusted LS

1004
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:31,749
inversion whether its firmware inversion

1005
00:45:29,979 --> 00:45:32,890
whatever it is that's the job of the

1006
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:37,390
suit manifest to say what the

1007
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:40,180
dependencies from this ta is okay now

1008
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:42,219
some of those issues up top I think at

1009
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,839
least two people eric nerd mark was one

1010
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:46,839
of them either one was that talked about

1011
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:49,328
well what happens if I Rev something the

1012
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:50,529
that wear something else depends on it

1013
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,989
then that could be at competish use

1014
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:55,060
right so if I Rev a TA you could maybe

1015
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:57,430
break an untrusted application

1016
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:59,920
if I Rev trusted firmware it could break

1017
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:01,859
a ta if I rev one ta it may break

1018
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,140
another ta that depends on it okay and

1019
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:07,030
so we would add a discussion that says

1020
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:08,609
there's compatibility issues and in your

1021
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,050
implantation need to be aware of that

1022
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:12,670
doesn't say exactly how to just says

1023
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:14,530
there is a section here you could do

1024
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:18,910
that by just allowing changes or

1025
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:23,740
whatever it is right okay so here is

1026
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:25,839
actual text from the per request that I

1027
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,580
will let you stare at for a second in

1028
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,140
case somebody wants to pick on a

1029
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,170
particular wording now but the intent

1030
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:33,759
was the bullets on the bottom to the two

1031
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:37,000
bullets on the bottom of the previous

1032
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,880
slide this is my intent or my text that

1033
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,100
would potentially capture that the

1034
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,350
dot-dot-dot in the middle means later

1035
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,670
slide inserts text in the middle of

1036
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:51,900
those two paragraphs for a different

1037
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:54,640
issue leave that up there for a second

1038
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,290
so you can all stare at it it's been up

1039
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,490
there on github but I'm not going to

1040
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,230
assume that anybody here has read the

1041
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:02,439
github for requests so this is your

1042
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,730
chance to pick on stuff a lot of the

1043
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,030
text previously that talked about

1044
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:09,070
dependencies he is then replaced by this

1045
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:10,810
text because we're basically saying the

1046
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:13,600
teep is not going to solve this problem

1047
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:15,130
that suits job and so there's less than

1048
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:20,339
we have to say we incorporate by

1049
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:22,720
reference using the suit manifest okay

1050
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,160
there's no objections I'm gonna move on

1051
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,060
okay I've left it up there for a minute

1052
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:30,629
or so moving on I said we're gonna get

1053
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:32,980
the security domains this is it okay so

1054
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:34,390
there's this long-standing issue number

1055
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,060
seven right back in the single-digit

1056
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,379
days there was to clarify this meaning

1057
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,310
of what do we mean by security domain

1058
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,700
that we've been talking about on every

1059
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:44,290
working group meeting since we started

1060
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,460
you're gonna also call this out saying I

1061
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:49,900
don't know if the security main thing is

1062
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:52,330
and his issue number 70 and we had

1063
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,150
recently filed issue number 62 with the

1064
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:57,549
title uh editorial update for a full SD

1065
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:59,740
or SD for removal although some of the

1066
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:01,890
discussion in the issue was that maybe

1067
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:04,419
we didn't mean full after all but still

1068
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:07,990
we had working group consensus to remove

1069
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,370
security domain as a formal concept but

1070
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:10,720
we still realize that some tea

1071
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:12,100
we'll have security domains in them like

1072
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,220
secure elements or things our global

1073
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:17,200
platform compliant but it's not a formal

1074
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,250
concept in here it may be a side effect

1075
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,410
or things you deal with an

1076
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,450
implementation but it wasn't something

1077
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:25,470
you explicitly called out as an element

1078
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:28,810
in the protocol per se so here is the

1079
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:31,419
hole request that would propose to do

1080
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:33,720
what issue number 62 s discussion was

1081
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,920
from previous IES this is my greeting of

1082
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,890
what we discussed and how I might

1083
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,240
attempt to accomplish that as an editor

1084
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:43,620
so there's two different pull requests

1085
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:47,200
number 72 and then part of 75 okay

1086
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:48,970
there's discussions in API names like

1087
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,649
create security domain was a specific

1088
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:53,859
API name we said well we're gonna remove

1089
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,420
that remove the OTR P message name

1090
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:57,220
especially since we're moving from the

1091
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,390
ot out here IP protocol to the T

1092
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,189
protocol so and I've talked about the

1093
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:03,670
auto key message names like create

1094
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:05,980
security domain remove the explicit

1095
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,630
entry of security domains from the

1096
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:11,530
terminology section which makes it sound

1097
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,970
like there's a formal concept depend on

1098
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,280
these this is the main point how it's

1099
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:17,589
related to suit which is if there's a

1100
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,620
dependency on something as part of the

1101
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:22,240
install steps in order to install this

1102
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:25,150
ta I have to create a security domain

1103
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,189
and then I can install the ta okay you

1104
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,750
can express that in the suit manifest in

1105
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:30,820
the suit manifest you say here's a set

1106
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:32,470
of install steps you can have an install

1107
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,180
step in the manifest that says create

1108
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,580
security domain or something has that is

1109
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,620
in effect right this is a way of saying

1110
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:40,960
we can accomplish the create security

1111
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,640
domain inside the suit manifest as long

1112
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,710
as the suit working group accepts this

1113
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,230
as a requirement and has a way to solve

1114
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:49,170
it okay which we will potentially talk

1115
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:54,010
about in the suit working group meeting

1116
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:58,290
which is just after lunch but les point

1117
00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:01,660
here still include the security domain

1118
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:03,910
informatively in example text and so the

1119
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,040
so like Ning for example felt strongly

1120
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:07,540
about this one which is we still need to

1121
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,100
explain what it means in a global

1122
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,300
platform environment for a te that has

1123
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,620
this concept of security domains what

1124
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,160
does it mean right so at least use an

1125
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:18,490
example okay so here is an example and

1126
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,339
this was that dot dot dot that was on my

1127
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,419
previous slide so the first paragraph is

1128
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,320
the one that you saw on the previous one

1129
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,080
and the bold

1130
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,900
is the new one it's inserted in that dot

1131
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:32,080
and so you can see for example this is

1132
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,060
clearly informative texts and it talks

1133
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,830
about t's compliant with global platform

1134
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,090
may have a notion of a security to me

1135
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:39,520
and here you can see not in the

1136
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:41,320
terminology section this is defining in

1137
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,910
line because it's not a formal concept

1138
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:48,910
of teeth and if we agree then this is

1139
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:50,710
expressing the dependency on suit to

1140
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,299
make sure the suit manifest is capable

1141
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,370
of expressing this as an installation

1142
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,590
step

1143
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:59,650
Ben Ben keener just pointing out that

1144
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:01,000
the internet security glossary RC 49:49

1145
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:04,660
does have a definition of security

1146
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,220
domain which it just calls domain but it

1147
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,560
does but it's not the same one as global

1148
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:11,020
platform but yes

1149
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:14,230
that is a good point which is

1150
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:16,360
potentially another reason to define it

1151
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:18,250
in line down here in the context of

1152
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:22,060
Google platform and that is some formal

1153
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:25,540
concepts ok so I believe that this

1154
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,620
paragraph here would address if Ming was

1155
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,570
here I don't know if he's actually a

1156
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,339
remote on the line ok Ming do you want

1157
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:33,070
to come to the mic and say your opinion

1158
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,610
on this one thank you kind of wait for

1159
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,610
him I

1160
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:45,940
ok I thank you for anything there yes it

1161
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:49,360
is to have a long Easter discussion of

1162
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,450
them secured to me whether we officially

1163
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:55,780
remove it as of formal concept or don't

1164
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:59,470
support it but it is still large section

1165
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:01,210
of devices there which will your mob

1166
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:03,129
stick it to me it's a reality and

1167
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,980
obviously gives us the informal text to

1168
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:08,350
you for those of the users will give us

1169
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:11,020
some of this class here so they have way

1170
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:14,560
to support it that was a wild mustangs

1171
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:16,450
right so meaning do you have any issues

1172
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,700
with the specific paragraph being shown

1173
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:21,520
which talks specifically about security

1174
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:24,640
domains and what the is good like is

1175
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:28,810
better like it since you were the one

1176
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,190
that was that there was vocally asking

1177
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:31,090
for such a statement I want to make sure

1178
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,990
this actually could meet your

1179
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:36,180
requirements oh yeah yeah we sure yes

1180
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:39,479
not that ok thank you

1181
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:42,149
all right because assuming we agree with

1182
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,339
these principles then I have something

1183
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:47,010
like 10 minutes or whatever in the suit

1184
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:49,259
working group today this afternoon to

1185
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:51,270
report out on whatever the teep working

1186
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,950
group decides is requirements for suit I

1187
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:54,059
have a spot to report that out to the

1188
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,109
rest of the to suit working group I know

1189
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:58,920
some of you are in this room right now

1190
00:52:55,109 --> 00:53:02,630
but we did Dave and I talked about that

1191
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:04,619
on the agenda today so or yeah okay

1192
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:08,339
unless there's any other comments I'm

1193
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:10,319
going to move on saying silence is at

1194
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:15,240
least no objection yeah I'm taking

1195
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:16,859
silences agreement okay great okay then

1196
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,868
there was just this discussion of this

1197
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:20,430
use case that says I want to keep

1198
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:25,490
secrets from the Tam in other words I am

1199
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:27,480
a SP or was a security provider that has

1200
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:29,578
applications that I want to distribute

1201
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,960
but I don't want and I want to keep them

1202
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:32,670
in secret you know the code for them

1203
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,890
could be encrypted than they or the data

1204
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,660
for them could be encrypted I don't want

1205
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:38,578
the Tam to have that that the key to

1206
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,899
decrypt it okay so I just want to use

1207
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:44,220
the Tam as intermediary this is a

1208
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:46,890
discussion we had previously that being

1209
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,109
how I see is that the Mike again was

1210
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,420
leading this discussion before and so

1211
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:55,109
this is summarizing what's in the issue

1212
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:57,089
we said the encrypted binary could be

1213
00:53:55,109 --> 00:54:00,029
delivered just like an unencrypted

1214
00:53:57,089 --> 00:54:01,109
binary which means that the Tam doesn't

1215
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:02,430
have the key because it doesn't really

1216
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:04,859
know where it's encrypted or not just a

1217
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,210
file which just means the decryption key

1218
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:07,828
would have to be delivered separately

1219
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,990
not through the team because the Tam

1220
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:11,220
doesn't have the decryption key and so

1221
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:13,589
then how would you deliver the

1222
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:15,509
decryption key and the discussion that

1223
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:19,049
is long back and forth from different

1224
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:22,230
people mostly David and myself and Ming

1225
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:24,480
and maybe Hannes in this issue you could

1226
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,640
get it through teep by a different Tam

1227
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,079
such as this SP running their own Tam

1228
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,250
that's just for purpose of handing out

1229
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:34,109
the key that was one proposal the

1230
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:35,579
current text and the document says the

1231
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:38,038
following though which is the problem

1232
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:39,839
the current text in a document says for

1233
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,240
any client app this is the untrusted app

1234
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:46,950
right there should only be a single Tam

1235
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:49,109
to contact okay and then the SP should

1236
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,919
provide the Tam with all the t's the D a

1237
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:52,558
pre-chorus no

1238
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,200
as the the the implication is that in

1239
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:58,319
your client app your your untrusted app

1240
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,058
manifest you say and here's the here's

1241
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,319
the TAS and here's the TAM and you're

1242
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:03,869
going to get all the th from the same

1243
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:05,339
time so if you get all the TAS all the

1244
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:07,500
dependencies everything in that it

1245
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:08,970
depends on from the same cam well now

1246
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,650
what does it mean when you have when I

1247
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,970
get the binary from one Tam but get the

1248
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,220
decryption key from a different ham that

1249
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:16,200
kind of contradicts and so the current

1250
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,730
text rules out the ability to do that

1251
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,609
particular proposal so what do we do

1252
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:21,839
that's what this issue is okay there's

1253
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:23,430
at least two different options that we

1254
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,130
could go here and I'm going to ask me to

1255
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:31,009
jump in after I get down to the bottom

1256
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:31,010
of the slide here option number one is

1257
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:35,640
what is closer to what the text

1258
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:37,890
currently says in the document at least

1259
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,779
that text that I showed which is there's

1260
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,629
a single Tam for the TA in all the

1261
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:45,540
dependencies okay what that really means

1262
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:46,950
is that the Tam for every dependency is

1263
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,950
assumed to be the same as the depending

1264
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:53,549
t8 so what this means is that the

1265
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:55,410
service rudder then by it has no choice

1266
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:57,690
it says I now have to host all the T's

1267
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:58,649
that depend on me right because I'm only

1268
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,210
going to give out the decryption key

1269
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:03,359
from me then everything depends on me

1270
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:07,079
has to use me as well okay so B option

1271
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:10,369
number one option number two is to

1272
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:12,900
change that text say that to imply that

1273
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:17,490
there can be a separate tab for each

1274
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:19,559
dependency and so the information about

1275
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,609
each Tam comes out of a manifest file

1276
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:21,809
which is how you the dependency

1277
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:24,299
information so you'd have to have for

1278
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:25,950
every dependency what the potential Tam

1279
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:29,250
URI is if it's different from the main

1280
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:31,049
one okay and of course if a TA depends

1281
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,250
on another ta the other ta could have

1282
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:34,650
its own suit manifest file for that

1283
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:36,059
matter so if we did this the way this

1284
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:37,559
would work is I'm going to install a

1285
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,970
particular ta kinda learn its

1286
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,430
dependencies and so I go to install the

1287
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:42,689
dependencies so now I have a request to

1288
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:44,430
install these dependencies and that

1289
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,650
comes in just like a request to install

1290
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:48,089
the TA from untrusted app I need you to

1291
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:50,700
unsolveds you kind of invoke its

1292
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:52,890
recursively okay and so it worked kind

1293
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,990
of the same way as it would right now as

1294
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:57,480
sorry as it would in the untrusted app

1295
00:56:54,990 --> 00:57:00,899
depending on a ta-a ta that depends on

1296
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:03,250
op te or on a firmware update or on

1297
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,310
another TA it would go through

1298
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,650
talk to the Tam get its soup manifest

1299
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:10,569
apply the steps and then continue on

1300
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,089
with the original installation that

1301
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:15,460
would be option to maybe there's other

1302
00:57:13,089 --> 00:57:16,480
options Ming you're in the queue I'm

1303
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,270
going to hand it off to you right now

1304
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:23,349
since this was partly your issue so go

1305
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:27,190
ahead he just disappeared you yeah

1306
00:57:23,349 --> 00:57:30,310
let me put him back on not intentionally

1307
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:34,089
no I didn't maybe you dropped hey man

1308
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:37,450
can you try and join again because I'm

1309
00:57:34,089 --> 00:57:38,650
not seeing them on that you okay well we

1310
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:41,680
can talk about in the room here and

1311
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:46,990
comes back in oh here we go yay okay

1312
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:48,669
next time I'll kick him off sir you know

1313
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,529
you to room meeting right into a meeting

1314
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:55,260
without quite somebody better they saw

1315
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:58,569
yes we came away with option to

1316
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,849
initialize activity we learn some most

1317
00:57:58,569 --> 00:58:03,400
on option ones upon them together later

1318
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:06,550
okay if you have a intrinsic a DSPs

1319
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:12,700
yacht you up to close that I don't

1320
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:18,339
delegate to not only do not trust that

1321
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:20,410
patient we came with that is that you

1322
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:22,299
know I was said not religious at a

1323
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:24,910
single warning is it most time you don't

1324
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:27,790
have too many TS right

1325
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:29,770
it depends on if a sacred one and you

1326
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:34,390
can't have a public here you download

1327
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:37,210
from some public one more shared time

1328
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:40,540
and the first time are more sensitive ta

1329
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:43,270
UK the from a speak I know we had a

1330
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,859
discussion prior to the discussion of

1331
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,480
having encrypted stuff we just said what

1332
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:47,619
do we do with dependencies and for that

1333
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,880
that's where some of the text and

1334
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:50,920
document came from it says when you just

1335
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,270
have dependencies we said it would be a

1336
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,339
lot simpler if you just get from the

1337
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:56,859
same one right this notion of how do I

1338
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:59,470
get a decryption key came after that and

1339
00:58:56,859 --> 00:59:01,089
said well that causes problems with the

1340
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,259
previous assumption and that's where we

1341
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:04,630
got to the current state that's right

1342
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,849
because that's way as a decryption you

1343
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:09,940
need talk with that with the SPD for

1344
00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:13,690
rock yeah right that was the way I saw

1345
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:15,900
the wreck okay this is why the text in

1346
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:17,700
the document does not match kind

1347
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,710
what the issues in discussion have been

1348
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,618
is because that history so I think

1349
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:25,559
harness is also online now yeah and it's

1350
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:28,069
honest I tried to put some text in in

1351
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,660
the issue and I hope I ultimately did

1352
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:32,819
based on a discussion there the problem

1353
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:34,490
was a little bit that on one hand you

1354
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:38,038
have the Pam you rely on it for

1355
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:40,890
distributing the trusted application but

1356
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:43,619
then you actually don't trust it

1357
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:46,170
entirely and so you have some other

1358
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:50,999
party behind it who provides the trusted

1359
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:53,460
application the service provider and the

1360
00:59:50,999 --> 00:59:56,759
question was like what's the interaction

1361
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:59,609
because there has to be a key as you

1362
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:04,440
said like distribution there when you

1363
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:07,680
send the encrypted trusted application

1364
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:10,200
and and associated metadata through that

1365
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,700
them and how does that work and how does

1366
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,249
that fit into the architecture because

1367
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:16,230
that entity is actually the entity then

1368
01:00:14,249 --> 01:00:17,700
behind the dam the service provider is

1369
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:20,730
not really there's no protocol

1370
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:23,220
interaction and so the conclusion there

1371
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:25,650
at least from what I recall was like

1372
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:28,950
okay then we call this other party than

1373
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:36,150
also a time which kind of makes sense of

1374
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:37,950
course there's it's still that it's this

1375
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:39,680
phrase here yeah but by a different

1376
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:41,879
serious writers team that is from

1377
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,749
summarizing that that text that's in the

1378
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,140
issue right now that you're talking

1379
01:00:42,749 --> 01:00:48,538
about right and of course from a

1380
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:53,339
communication protocol point of view

1381
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:55,980
there is to me which is not yet covered

1382
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:57,569
in in sort of the solution work is like

1383
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:01,890
how does the message interaction really

1384
01:00:57,569 --> 01:01:04,499
work do you talk to it to one time and

1385
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,999
then relay it the messages what do you

1386
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:08,149
actually talk to different dams then

1387
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:10,558
item Utley which of course would be

1388
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:14,390
simpler I would say the latter although

1389
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,390
you're correct that there's no text yeah

1390
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:22,379
so what I've heard so far seems to imply

1391
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,730
that as a working group we want to go

1392
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,739
with option two if we can find the right

1393
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:28,880
text there's no quest on this right now

1394
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:28,880
that's just an open issue right

1395
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:38,190
mmm I think option number one came from

1396
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:41,940
the discussion that we had with David

1397
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:44,940
wheeler who's not here right now but is

1398
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:47,670
there anybody that is here virtually

1399
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,140
remotely or present that would have any

1400
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,910
other issues with going in direction

1401
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:58,230
number two if we can find the right way

1402
01:01:50,910 --> 01:02:00,120
to do it in text okay otherwise we will

1403
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:02,310
take it as an action item for editors to

1404
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:05,930
come up with a text that tries to

1405
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:05,930
accomplish the intent at box number two

1406
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:20,790
sounds fair okay will you make that okay

1407
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:22,410
with you Ming yes yes yes tentative

1408
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:24,450
consensus to try to come up with option

1409
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,470
number two and the editors have action

1410
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,600
at them to try to figure out how to do

1411
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:29,549
that yeah okay I mean we can actually

1412
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:33,560
wait for the proposed type since I can't

1413
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,560
close the issue anyway that's true yeah

1414
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:43,169
all right next issue it's okay multiple

1415
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:46,920
Tammy rise for a TAS this is issue

1416
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:48,090
number 14 and so I don't know something

1417
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,860
wants to get back in the queue otherwise

1418
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:53,910
I'm just going to summarize what his

1419
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:56,610
issue is here he okay

1420
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:58,890
Ming had proposed that a particular ta

1421
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:01,740
could be carried by multiple tabs and an

1422
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:04,230
example is if I have a particular TA and

1423
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:08,069
I distribute it in and I distributed

1424
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:09,240
along with all right I have an untrusted

1425
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,500
application I distribute through the

1426
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,450
Google Playstore and an untrusted

1427
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,670
application I distributed to the Apple

1428
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:17,310
Store and an untrusted application I

1429
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:18,810
distributed Microsoft Store and they can

1430
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,970
all run on the same hardware whatever

1431
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:22,350
and so I'm going to use the same ta but

1432
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:24,540
all three DS applications depend on them

1433
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,980
okay and so can I have the same TA

1434
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,810
binary that's hosted by multiple tabs

1435
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,780
such as one per app store as an example

1436
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:32,190
right and so and so his point was well

1437
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:35,100
yeah you should be able to do that right

1438
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:38,070
and so then he proposed that you should

1439
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,620
be able to allow even multiple Tam's

1440
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:41,829
mentioned in the same manifest file for

1441
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,150
a TA right

1442
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:45,189
all right given things that depend on it

1443
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:46,689
like one fetch the the manifest for it

1444
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:49,269
and I get here's multiple possibilities

1445
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,379
I get them through any of these TAS so

1446
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:51,788
you can download if any of those they're

1447
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:53,319
all the equivalent and so use the one

1448
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:54,729
you're already using for example right

1449
01:03:53,319 --> 01:03:56,288
if you have a dependent you're already

1450
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:57,698
using one for the thing that depends on

1451
01:03:56,289 --> 01:04:00,519
it go ahead and use this because I see

1452
01:03:57,699 --> 01:04:02,079
it in the list and so only one of the

1453
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:03,549
Tim's needs to be contacted and the

1454
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,809
others could be use just failover if the

1455
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:10,989
primary fails to respond that's

1456
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:13,929
basically means okay and so that seems

1457
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:16,239
reasonable to me this is in the suit

1458
01:04:13,929 --> 01:04:17,619
section because this means that when you

1459
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,799
have if you have a TA that depends on

1460
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:22,959
another TA then you need says there's a

1461
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:25,689
manifest requirement for expressing

1462
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:27,069
multiple URIs for where or where that

1463
01:04:25,689 --> 01:04:30,729
particular binary could be found not

1464
01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:32,339
just a single you're right seems

1465
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:36,160
reasonable to me

1466
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:38,170
any objections otherwise this will go

1467
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,578
this we would come up with text here and

1468
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:41,529
this would be relayed as another

1469
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:42,699
dependency or an ask to make sure that

1470
01:04:41,529 --> 01:04:45,339
the suit manifest is capable of

1471
01:04:42,699 --> 01:04:46,869
expressing this concept so I just have

1472
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:49,900
one clarification because in the

1473
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:53,410
previous issue the option number two was

1474
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:56,140
to allow for the agent to have multiple

1475
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:58,928
Tam's correct dependency that's that one

1476
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:01,749
was for multiple Tam's for different TAS

1477
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:03,130
and of course it may have to go to

1478
01:05:01,749 --> 01:05:05,499
multiple of them because it has to get

1479
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:07,329
each ta this one is someone orthogonals

1480
01:05:05,499 --> 01:05:09,160
has to get it but in a piece within a TA

1481
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:17,499
I got multiple choices I can go to

1482
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:23,609
anything 101 they are related let me go

1483
01:05:17,499 --> 01:05:27,729
back here yeah so for example multiple

1484
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:33,578
that's what I'm tryna in which one

1485
01:05:27,729 --> 01:05:36,299
number issue number 14 the the yes

1486
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:36,299
correct

1487
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:43,689
multiple components that need to be

1488
01:05:39,759 --> 01:05:46,719
installed it could be multiple TAS or to

1489
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:48,999
put on some suit terminology here a suit

1490
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:52,539
manifest can express dependencies on

1491
01:05:48,999 --> 01:05:54,160
files your files may or may not actually

1492
01:05:52,539 --> 01:05:55,220
need binaries they could be anything

1493
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,279
okay

1494
01:05:55,220 --> 01:06:01,939
so for example you could have a binary

1495
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:03,530
and the configuration be separate IDs in

1496
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,849
a suit manifest they could also be

1497
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:06,290
bundled together and say those are in

1498
01:06:04,849 --> 01:06:07,400
the same file or whatever but if you

1499
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,930
have them as being separate you could

1500
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,880
say this binary depends on this

1501
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:13,279
configuration file and you have to get

1502
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,140
them from different locations okay and

1503
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,400
so this is extending says is the thing

1504
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:18,200
that you're depending on it's not a TA

1505
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,630
per se but it is an element in the suit

1506
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,879
manifest and so if the way that you got

1507
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:25,490
the key the decryption key here right

1508
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,560
those decryption key is is deliberate

1509
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:29,839
separately but by a different Tam the

1510
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:32,480
Tam here is delivering a decryption key

1511
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,130
not a binary it could be a binary that

1512
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,140
has the encryption key in it or it could

1513
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:37,960
just be the decryption key and you call

1514
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:40,040
that not a TA you'd call that another

1515
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:44,450
file that's pointed to you by the

1516
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:46,190
manifest okay so now we're up here this

1517
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,660
says okay for one of those files which

1518
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:48,890
could be a TA or it could even be

1519
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:51,020
something of them TA if you're talking

1520
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:52,879
about suit outside of scope deep this

1521
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:54,380
there could be multiple equivalent

1522
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:58,790
places you could get it from that have

1523
01:06:54,380 --> 01:07:04,640
different you are eyes okay and so the

1524
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:05,690
relationship is if you have one thing

1525
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,730
that depends on another thing and I'll

1526
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:10,490
use two t8 here I could have used a TA

1527
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:11,750
and say opti I could have use a TA and

1528
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:14,479
trusted firmware if I have two things

1529
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:15,680
one that depends on the other and let's

1530
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,000
say the thing that's being dependent on

1531
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:19,640
let's say I'm going to depend on a

1532
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,609
particular version of opti okay that can

1533
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:24,109
be distributed through ATM okay let's

1534
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:26,930
say that version of op T is accessible

1535
01:07:24,109 --> 01:07:28,430
via three tabs the particular ta that

1536
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:31,279
depends on that I'm trying to use is

1537
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:33,859
only accessible at one of those which

1538
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,119
opti Tim am I going to use probably the

1539
01:07:33,859 --> 01:07:36,410
one I'm already talking to is going to

1540
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,460
be the most efficient right and so

1541
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:40,069
that's the relationship is this

1542
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:43,010
flexibility of having multiple says if

1543
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:46,040
I'm already picking one for a depending

1544
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:48,380
thing and I have multiple choices for

1545
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,490
the thing that it's depending on then it

1546
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,660
gives me more freedom to be more

1547
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:52,729
efficient by picking the one I'm already

1548
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:54,200
talking to you so these two issues are

1549
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:56,810
related but they're different issues

1550
01:07:54,200 --> 01:08:01,779
okay I see a couple nods out there so

1551
01:07:56,810 --> 01:08:06,529
hopefully that's clear enough all right

1552
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:09,000
all right so next topic trust anchor

1553
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:10,980
storage the original issue had a

1554
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,510
label is kind of a misnomer right it was

1555
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:14,010
originally labeled as should the trust I

1556
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:15,780
care format be specified in separate

1557
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:17,509
draft if you read the issue that ought

1558
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:20,009
now that's not what it's about anymore

1559
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:21,899
it's actually about specifying the

1560
01:08:20,009 --> 01:08:24,500
requirements for how you protect trust

1561
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:26,639
anchors okay

1562
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:31,080
section five point eight of the t p--

1563
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:33,299
architecture Ernie says to protect trust

1564
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,950
anchors it talks about them talks about

1565
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:37,140
protecting the trust anchors inside of

1566
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:38,870
at eee you store the trust anchors

1567
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:41,250
inside ite for some of these things a

1568
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:43,259
suit architecture has specific

1569
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:46,229
definitions of trust anchor and trust

1570
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:48,049
anchors store which have language

1571
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:50,429
analyst pulled out of this t p-- issue

1572
01:08:48,049 --> 01:08:53,130
that was put into the suit architecture

1573
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:56,490
document because same question comes up

1574
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:58,230
and suit and so I think brendan had

1575
01:08:56,490 --> 01:09:00,210
already pulled the text out of here into

1576
01:08:58,229 --> 01:09:01,469
the suit architecture the question is

1577
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:03,839
what do you want to do in the t parka

1578
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:05,339
tech chure so he could copy the

1579
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,540
definitions from the suit architecture

1580
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:08,339
given that we're depending on the suit

1581
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:11,189
manifest and say now the text is the

1582
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:14,339
same text in both documents we could say

1583
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:15,689
this document uses the definitions of TR

1584
01:09:14,339 --> 01:09:19,229
stanker and trust anchor store as

1585
01:09:15,689 --> 01:09:20,759
defined in suit architecture and not

1586
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:23,219
copy them in here just include them by

1587
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:25,220
reference and say as defined in there um

1588
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:28,319
or we could take some other approach hey

1589
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:31,040
do people care or that just the editors

1590
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,040
can do whatever you want

1591
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:41,339
would you say yeah Honus said not at the

1592
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:42,509
mic he prefers number two I don't know

1593
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:45,028
if anybody else has a preference oh I

1594
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:48,420
see rust back there also says you thumbs

1595
01:09:45,029 --> 01:09:51,450
up on number two okay Dave Walter wire

1596
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:53,819
so we have the other suit chairs saying

1597
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:55,559
a thumbs up on number two okay that's

1598
01:09:53,819 --> 01:09:58,730
hopeful direction to the editors thank

1599
01:09:55,560 --> 01:10:01,230
you alright

1600
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:02,879
then there's two issues that are related

1601
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:04,919
because I'm gonna show them both in the

1602
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,780
same table there on part of their little

1603
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:10,890
bit interrelated which is about this

1604
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:12,840
term device secure storage hey

1605
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:14,730
so figure six in the architecture

1606
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,950
document has a table and I'm always

1607
01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:19,169
showing or summarizing two rows and only

1608
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:20,790
a couple columns out that table which

1609
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:22,200
says here's a bunch of keys and

1610
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,750
certificates and here's where they are

1611
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,720
and here's

1612
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:27,970
allottee okay and so it talks about you

1613
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:30,010
can have trusted firmware that has its

1614
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,840
own key pair and certificate and can

1615
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:34,270
have a te that has its own key pair and

1616
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,580
certificate and what the document says

1617
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:38,050
right now is the trusted firmware is key

1618
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:39,760
pair and certificate are stored in

1619
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:41,380
what's called device secure storage

1620
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,170
which is a term that's never defined and

1621
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:47,680
a te has stuff that stored in the device

1622
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:49,330
- EE and it says the cardinality the

1623
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,310
device secure storage the trusted

1624
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:54,309
firmware has one per device and the TE

1625
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:56,020
used to say one per device but issue

1626
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:57,730
number 30 was pointing out well that's

1627
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:58,930
not correct because the document already

1628
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:01,000
talks about that you can have multiple

1629
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:03,760
te es per device and so it doesn't make

1630
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,170
sense to have things that's one per

1631
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,240
device when you have multiple per device

1632
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:09,190
and so that's changed to say one per te

1633
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,349
that's the part that's in red there that

1634
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:12,879
so leaves the question of what the top

1635
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:15,550
middle box should say about device

1636
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:18,010
secure storage so the filer and number

1637
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:19,630
58 I forget who filed it asked what is

1638
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:22,720
this device secure storage should that

1639
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:24,190
say device te II that's there and I had

1640
01:11:22,720 --> 01:11:25,540
responded in there saying I don't think

1641
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:27,250
it's the Ted device te because it gave

1642
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:29,650
me multiple te es there and you can only

1643
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:33,490
got one key firmer so what should it say

1644
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:35,860
okay Honus um I was wondering whether we

1645
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:38,170
could recycle some of the discussions

1646
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:40,839
from the rats group here who talked

1647
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:43,810
about the root of trust and in some

1648
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:49,630
sense you what it boils down to in

1649
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:52,620
practices then you rely on some sort of

1650
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:55,540
rom code or a code that can be then made

1651
01:11:52,620 --> 01:12:01,000
sort of read-only at some point in time

1652
01:11:55,540 --> 01:12:02,740
at the PIM minimum within the suit

1653
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,600
working group there was a discussion a

1654
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:06,160
while back coming more than a year ago

1655
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:09,760
and the question the suit working group

1656
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:11,380
was should we roughly paraphrase how the

1657
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,790
question was asked and the question was

1658
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,960
something like should we use the term

1659
01:12:12,790 --> 01:12:16,450
root of trust or should we use the term

1660
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:19,090
trust anchor or some other variation of

1661
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:20,980
that question okay and the suit working

1662
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:22,740
group said and I'm looking at my

1663
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:25,450
co-chairs to either nod or correct me

1664
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:26,110
that the two terms are not necessarily

1665
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:28,090
the same thing

1666
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,349
the IETF tends to use trust anchor we're

1667
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:31,870
going to use that term in the suit

1668
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:32,920
architecture document and if and

1669
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,090
hopefully we don't need to use the term

1670
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,650
root of trust but if it does we'll use

1671
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:36,520
that in passing explorations yep organ

1672
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:39,969
is user whose turn

1673
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:43,420
thank you and rats the rats

1674
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:45,460
architectures and documents tend to

1675
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:48,360
imply the route of trust is a term that

1676
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:50,500
applies to a piece of hardware and

1677
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:52,360
that's why I said it may or may not be

1678
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:55,030
the same thing as trust anchor depending

1679
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:59,230
on your definition of who to trust when

1680
01:12:55,030 --> 01:13:02,259
so here you can see my proposal on what

1681
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:06,700
to say for device secure storage and I

1682
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:09,130
suggest there was text that was added to

1683
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:11,050
the definition of trust anchor store in

1684
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:13,150
the suit manifest that was expect it was

1685
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:14,980
a sentence or two that was out of the t

1686
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:17,650
p-- issue that was expectations around

1687
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:21,009
trust anchor storage that are on the

1688
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:22,839
security of that my proposal was we make

1689
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:25,060
an equivalent statement for device

1690
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:28,000
secure storage and just use an almost

1691
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:30,250
identical text without saying that a

1692
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,420
trust anchor store and device secure

1693
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:34,060
storage do the same thing just

1694
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:37,930
requirements the same but what do you

1695
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:41,980
guys think yeah so it's so for me a

1696
01:13:37,930 --> 01:13:44,560
trust anchor and root of trust is not

1697
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:46,120
the same um trust anchor here is often

1698
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,400
referred to as being like a public key

1699
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:50,410
certificate but for me a Trust anchor

1700
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,120
store in a writ of trust is a more

1701
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:53,769
interesting comparison but those may not

1702
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:58,660
be the same either right I see another

1703
01:13:53,770 --> 01:14:01,750
people and also I consider the root of

1704
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:04,389
trust more than just just a key but it's

1705
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:06,910
also its and more than the hardware

1706
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:11,530
because there's also there needs to be

1707
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:13,360
some software but when and in in in many

1708
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:15,280
cases like if you have trusted firmware

1709
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,929
of course trusted firmware is or the

1710
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,809
firmware itself is it's organized in

1711
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:21,610
different layers but there may be there

1712
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:25,000
order will be some code that you can

1713
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:28,019
replace and update but at some point in

1714
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:32,080
time you have to have some code in there

1715
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:34,750
and the key along with it that cannot be

1716
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:39,730
changed because otherwise someone with

1717
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:42,280
someone who you may or may not like will

1718
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:44,980
change the code and then security goes

1719
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:48,490
out of the window but so so in that

1720
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:49,678
sense their secure storage then refers

1721
01:14:48,490 --> 01:14:53,749
to like

1722
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:57,030
literally rum or something similar like

1723
01:14:53,749 --> 01:14:58,590
coat some storage where you burn the

1724
01:14:57,030 --> 01:15:02,489
fuses at some point in time is actually

1725
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:04,709
when I posted the link to the list about

1726
01:15:02,489 --> 01:15:07,339
that advice a hardware that I mentioned

1727
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:10,260
from AC Milan fuse our common example

1728
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:12,659
you can do literally you can burn the

1729
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:16,010
fuse and then you can't change the trust

1730
01:15:12,659 --> 01:15:18,150
anchor no more and then then that's it

1731
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:20,429
but your point is that's different from

1732
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:22,739
the device t'ee right there is something

1733
01:15:20,429 --> 01:15:27,840
rom effuse etc which is different from

1734
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:29,579
say trust zone or SGX or whatever which

1735
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,400
was the filers original question is how

1736
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:36,360
do i define okay carry carry money I'm

1737
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:39,150
Qualcomm if looking back into the Common

1738
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:41,070
Criteria T protection profile they do

1739
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:44,039
the way they define trusted storage

1740
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:45,840
seems to include not just ta persistent

1741
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:48,239
data but also the trust anchor store I

1742
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:51,439
guess are you looking at device secure

1743
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:54,239
storage to be a superset of that of

1744
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:56,309
trusted storage or do you think of it as

1745
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:59,820
being a or do you think of it as being

1746
01:15:56,309 --> 01:16:01,409
equivalent in the te context my reading

1747
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,179
of the table since I wasn't the person

1748
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:06,089
that wrote it is a subset that

1749
01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:08,969
everything in the table is a trust

1750
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:11,189
anchor store okay so your trusted

1751
01:16:08,969 --> 01:16:14,729
firmware has a trust anchor it's store

1752
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:16,050
for the trusted firmwares key or a

1753
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:17,939
certificate maybe in a different

1754
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:20,760
location than a different component like

1755
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:23,309
the TE so for example I have a device

1756
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:25,260
that has I have a laptop that has both

1757
01:16:23,309 --> 01:16:27,780
SGX and a TPM in it

1758
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:29,099
okay and may have some trusted firmware

1759
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,389
or micro code or whatever in the

1760
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:32,400
processor those are three different

1761
01:16:30,389 --> 01:16:33,809
things that maybe have the key stored in

1762
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:37,829
four different places like in the sock

1763
01:16:33,809 --> 01:16:41,939
in the TPM and inside SGX protected

1764
01:16:37,829 --> 01:16:46,018
storage sealed storage okay after

1765
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:48,719
Lorne's I'm gonna let mango so my

1766
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:51,420
comments are kind of in line with what I

1767
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,599
was saying before whenever you use the

1768
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:57,150
word secure or trusted you're sort of

1769
01:16:54,599 --> 01:17:00,059
trying to imply something as absolute

1770
01:16:57,150 --> 01:17:03,269
and I don't think of anything ever is so

1771
01:17:00,059 --> 01:17:06,870
you have to say secure against what

1772
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:08,550
trusted for what is it and and if you're

1773
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:10,440
storing and it's also matters of your

1774
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:13,950
storing material that has to be

1775
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:16,710
immutable or versed stuff that needs to

1776
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:18,630
be secret so if you're storing a public

1777
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:20,400
key all you need is you immutability if

1778
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:23,370
you're storing a secret key you need

1779
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:26,580
secrecy so and and I say you know think

1780
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:28,110
about attacks um okay ROM you say wow

1781
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:30,780
that's cool that's wrong but if I got a

1782
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:32,730
fib a focused ion beam I can I can

1783
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:36,030
change rom all right people do that

1784
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:37,620
right and depends on your attacking an

1785
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:41,580
attacker are you what are you protecting

1786
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:43,830
are you protecting you know the secret

1787
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:46,830
of the device it would have been useful

1788
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:48,570
for me to copy in the text that's in the

1789
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:50,040
suit manifest it's that extra sentence

1790
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:52,410
that's the requirements are trust anchor

1791
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:54,870
store I suspect that what you're talking

1792
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:56,490
about that sentence tries to address

1793
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:58,080
whether it's sufficient or not it would

1794
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:59,760
be a question to you and I can't show it

1795
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,860
on the screen so so it seems like all

1796
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,750
you can do in a protocol document

1797
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:05,400
certification documents different than a

1798
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:10,290
protocol document is you can just say

1799
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:13,259
secure storage is a place that is kind

1800
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:15,540
of for storing things like this and how

1801
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:16,920
secure it is depends on certification

1802
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:22,200
and your requirements and that's all you

1803
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:24,360
need to say I'm taking that as a yes to

1804
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,550
the proposal on the bottom is how I read

1805
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:35,820
that you said something was in the queue

1806
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:37,950
yeah yes two comments here first of all

1807
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:40,290
I had to they aren't you know a

1808
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:42,660
background of this right we talked about

1809
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:46,410
the last sickest are just is referred to

1810
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:49,050
the trust firmware key that it was one

1811
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:51,809
per device they will have a separate e

1812
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:54,270
key yeah that one's a Teague he's a warm

1813
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:56,610
party and I we already rather you have

1814
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:58,460
come here one purty thats thought he

1815
01:18:56,610 --> 01:19:00,990
would do not measure in a secure storage

1816
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:04,200
so their compact that the trust for my

1817
01:19:00,990 --> 01:19:06,090
kid that also is optional with a mate is

1818
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:09,720
and not a mandatory it's not required of

1819
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:12,150
a team to work because some some people

1820
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:15,840
are playing may not have it so the watch

1821
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:16,989
TX has no notion yeah and they'd write

1822
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,630
data for the trust for

1823
01:19:16,989 --> 01:19:22,928
Wiki original motivation was that it

1824
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:24,639
will be in hardware for device right a

1825
01:19:22,929 --> 01:19:26,260
window forsake your putti you put the

1826
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:28,599
load of somewhere just secretive because

1827
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:30,309
with general your secret storage in the

1828
01:19:28,599 --> 01:19:31,960
means and someone's saying incredibly

1829
01:19:30,309 --> 01:19:35,050
even use fusion key right I wouldn't

1830
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:36,820
come out to the device manufacturer so

1831
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:40,300
that it was of a general meaning of the

1832
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:41,558
time and it is entrusted for more keys a

1833
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:45,719
particular application

1834
01:19:41,559 --> 01:19:48,519
applying to this saucer form away key

1835
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:51,150
between two clarifying and going to

1836
01:19:48,519 --> 01:19:53,829
Lawrence's comment when you say a

1837
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:58,388
manufacturer key is that an immutable

1838
01:19:53,829 --> 01:20:01,679
key not immutable not remember but I

1839
01:19:58,389 --> 01:20:04,420
think what I got from our ancestors that

1840
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:06,309
you shouldn't over constrain that right

1841
01:20:04,420 --> 01:20:07,480
you shouldn't say whether it's mutable

1842
01:20:06,309 --> 01:20:10,420
and I mean well you just say what it

1843
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:12,369
needs to defend against in general

1844
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:14,409
increased or sentence that I'm referring

1845
01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:16,299
to you in the suit manifest does say and

1846
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:20,320
it must resist I remember how its phrase

1847
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:21,159
but it's like I must resist iterations

1848
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:27,549
for them right now

1849
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:30,638
must must be resistant to this is honest

1850
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:33,159
um I like what Lauren said because

1851
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:34,869
indeed the terms trusted and secure have

1852
01:20:33,159 --> 01:20:37,839
different meanings to different people

1853
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:41,469
and may vary in context and and I don't

1854
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:44,860
think this text was meant to be sort of

1855
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:46,929
overly constraining in any way but so

1856
01:20:44,860 --> 01:20:49,030
what I'm suggesting is maybe wish we

1857
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:51,639
could provide some examples here on what

1858
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:54,550
people typically do it today they may do

1859
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:57,639
it differently in the future but I think

1860
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:59,699
that already gives a good indication to

1861
01:20:57,639 --> 01:21:05,760
the read on like what are the different

1862
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:05,759
sort of sort of cases essentially

1863
01:21:08,820 --> 01:21:13,210
something yeah yeah I think I agree I

1864
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:15,400
think maybe you could give me example I

1865
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:17,499
know I can I have a good talk with a few

1866
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,929
people on this one that is if how much

1867
01:21:17,499 --> 01:21:22,570
time we talk about the former key had to

1868
01:21:19,929 --> 01:21:24,369
burn there there was a even we have

1869
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:29,009
subparagraph II in the past how to do

1870
01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:30,429
that and as for the arm table has done

1871
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:32,350
[Music]

1872
01:21:30,429 --> 01:21:35,560
as a follow-up I think we can add some

1873
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:37,929
example here what that missed being a

1874
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:42,550
strict definition looks a bit tricky

1875
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:46,810
here as we are discussing I do still

1876
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:49,690
have time checking yeah go ahead

1877
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:52,780
so in terms of defend against I think

1878
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:57,159
defend against you know like whether

1879
01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:58,000
it's read right sign with but don't give

1880
01:21:57,159 --> 01:22:00,879
me the key

1881
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,880
decrypt that's that makes sense if it's

1882
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,679
defend against uh you know a script

1883
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:09,310
kiddie or a guy with the focused ion

1884
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:10,750
beam or a buffer overrun that does not

1885
01:22:09,310 --> 01:22:13,390
make sense I agree

1886
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:19,030
okay all right so since he has time

1887
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:25,540
check you have about 37 minutes left

1888
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:27,040
okay I I'm gonna try to unless the chair

1889
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:28,239
over rows me I'm gonna try to not call

1890
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,370
time in any particular issue as long

1891
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:32,080
because I as editors I want to know what

1892
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:34,150
to do on each other ya know that's why I

1893
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,290
was doing the time check just because I

1894
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:38,019
think it's important for you to get

1895
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:39,940
through all the issues um but to close

1896
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:42,190
on this one I didn't hear any objections

1897
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:48,280
to the proposal just an elaboration we

1898
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:51,190
will attend all right trust anchor

1899
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:55,269
update so this is number 32 also called

1900
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:58,860
out by jörgen the current text says it's

1901
01:22:55,270 --> 01:23:01,780
out of scope to update trust anchors

1902
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:03,580
it's out of scope to update you know the

1903
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:05,320
key that the set of certificates that

1904
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:07,360
you will consider trusted like the tam

1905
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:08,830
certificate that is in the device the

1906
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,290
device is difficult and says that's out

1907
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:13,059
of scope and that a device manufacturer

1908
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:15,699
is expected to provide its trust anchors

1909
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:18,340
live update or out of band update you

1910
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:20,199
device administrators so right now it

1911
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:23,800
says you don't use the teak protocol or

1912
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:26,710
ot RP to update trust anchors and to

1913
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:29,340
people ask well t p-- is for

1914
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:31,570
provisioning te ease both code and data

1915
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:34,650
you're storing trust anchors and te

1916
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:37,389
can't you use t protocol to update them

1917
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:40,449
that's basically with issues asking its

1918
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:41,199
the proposal is to allow that but not

1919
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:44,230
mandate it

1920
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:46,599
okay so here's an example a

1921
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:47,830
sure could have a trust anchor manager

1922
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,350
ta with trust anchors in the

1923
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:51,640
configuration ADA for that ta showing as

1924
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:53,110
an example here's a way that you could

1925
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,520
actually use the T protocol to do you

1926
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:55,660
don't have to do it this way but I'm

1927
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:00,489
saying it would be applicable if you

1928
01:23:55,660 --> 01:24:02,110
chose to do this especially since two

1929
01:24:00,489 --> 01:24:03,099
people ask isn't that what T protocol is

1930
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:04,389
supposed to your teeth is supposed to be

1931
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,380
doing is managing T ease and

1932
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:07,210
provisioning them isn't this

1933
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:08,440
provisioning at-te would just seem odd

1934
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:11,130
if the answer was no that's kind of how

1935
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:14,440
it came across the other G follower so

1936
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:16,090
then I've been here sorry I was just

1937
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,099
looking at the text on the slide and it

1938
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:21,010
seems to imply that the ability to

1939
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:22,960
update the trust anchor is mandatory and

1940
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:24,790
given some of the previous discussion we

1941
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,700
had about root of trust and you're

1942
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:31,630
blowing fuses do we actually want that

1943
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:32,980
to be mandatory in this case I need to

1944
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:35,800
explain because they're not actually

1945
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:39,190
talking about the same thing okay so

1946
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:41,950
yeah let me go back here this right here

1947
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:45,309
I said there's only a subset of the rows

1948
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:46,960
and the only a subset of the columns I'm

1949
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:48,310
actually jumping over to calm now and

1950
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,620
I'm sorry I didn't make that be clear

1951
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:54,340
before I understand the confusion okay

1952
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:57,460
this is talking about you have the de

1953
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:58,720
and you have it's the te has the key

1954
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,000
pair for itself so in other words you

1955
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:02,590
have and private Keeks is about you okay

1956
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,989
so it's like your own trust I try to

1957
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:07,660
anchor for yourself separately from that

1958
01:25:04,989 --> 01:25:10,809
you have the set of say public keys that

1959
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:12,010
you trust okay but you know the private

1960
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:16,060
key for that's information about

1961
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:18,790
somebody else this is about updating

1962
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:20,140
those the public keys that you consider

1963
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:23,140
trusted if the certificates you consider

1964
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:25,510
trusted how do I update those because

1965
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:28,000
that is mutable how do i do ownership

1966
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:29,560
transfer right how do I say your new Tam

1967
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,330
key because your Tam gets revved it's

1968
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:33,760
certificate and here's your new tan

1969
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:36,210
certificate can I update that because I

1970
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:39,000
do key rollover I do certificate

1971
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:41,110
refreshment as it gets close to the TDL

1972
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,790
can I use teacher vision the new

1973
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:44,950
certificate with has a new TTL can I do

1974
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:48,360
that I guess I think what I'm saying is

1975
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:51,040
that I agree we should provide some

1976
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:52,839
mechanism or considerations for people

1977
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,750
will want to do this sort of update yeah

1978
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,579
but I'm wondering if there's also going

1979
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:59,589
to be a case where people want to

1980
01:25:57,579 --> 01:26:03,608
you forbid this type of update for a

1981
01:25:59,589 --> 01:26:07,719
particular device yes yes it's a good

1982
01:26:03,609 --> 01:26:09,849
point and that's why in the proposal

1983
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:13,979
here there's the word may down there in

1984
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:16,869
lower case but yeah that I hear you yeah

1985
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:19,389
along the same lines of been I think

1986
01:26:16,869 --> 01:26:20,949
there would be probably be a policy

1987
01:26:19,389 --> 01:26:22,889
question here's well whether you are

1988
01:26:20,949 --> 01:26:25,928
able until how to do that then also

1989
01:26:22,889 --> 01:26:27,969
practically if something if there may be

1990
01:26:25,929 --> 01:26:31,749
different layers of keys even on a

1991
01:26:27,969 --> 01:26:34,899
device and so different types of trust

1992
01:26:31,749 --> 01:26:38,639
anchors and some may not be modifiable

1993
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:41,769
or updatable in yeah that's just a

1994
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:43,989
deployment strategy and preference and

1995
01:26:41,769 --> 01:26:46,030
and you can't have the protocol can

1996
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:50,169
change that but having the possibility

1997
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:57,518
to update them and make sense to me mean

1998
01:26:50,169 --> 01:27:00,539
I think we kick him out again come back

1999
01:26:57,519 --> 01:27:13,809
Mike Ming sorry

2000
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:16,989
try it again yeah no I'm good here I

2001
01:27:13,809 --> 01:27:20,289
think I think it cannot be mandatory

2002
01:27:16,989 --> 01:27:22,358
that to me yeah right right yep well I

2003
01:27:20,289 --> 01:27:24,789
would be allowed where previously it was

2004
01:27:22,359 --> 01:27:27,969
declared to be out of scope as opposed

2005
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:30,608
to you know you could use it okay moving

2006
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:32,919
on we may add to this based on

2007
01:27:30,609 --> 01:27:34,570
discussions but this is just my list of

2008
01:27:32,919 --> 01:27:36,070
things that some of the things we've

2009
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:38,409
talked about that would I then I would

2010
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:40,299
then relay to suit as things that we

2011
01:27:38,409 --> 01:27:42,789
depend on that the suit manifest may or

2012
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:44,499
may not already provide and so to say

2013
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:46,389
Haiti would be making use the following

2014
01:27:44,499 --> 01:27:47,978
things you may already provide them if

2015
01:27:46,389 --> 01:27:49,419
so hey Brennan great tell us how they're

2016
01:27:47,979 --> 01:27:51,820
already there or if not consider adding

2017
01:27:49,419 --> 01:27:53,439
it alright now when we've on off of the

2018
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:57,099
suit related ones over to the rats

2019
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:59,289
related ones okay so as a reminder the

2020
01:27:57,099 --> 01:28:01,510
teep working group previously has had

2021
01:27:59,289 --> 01:28:04,809
consensus to say rather than doing

2022
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:07,030
attestation in the t p-- protocol RTP

2023
01:28:04,809 --> 01:28:08,769
working group we would like to just push

2024
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:10,809
that over to the rats working group and

2025
01:28:08,769 --> 01:28:11,350
not have to compete with them but just

2026
01:28:10,809 --> 01:28:13,870
use the

2027
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:15,760
be a consumer of their technology okay

2028
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:17,559
and so that's not what the architecture

2029
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,940
document had before and so these are

2030
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,710
issues that were to relate to that

2031
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:23,650
discussions to how to handle it

2032
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:25,780
I just want a day of altameyer I just

2033
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:29,500
wanted to mention you've raised a few

2034
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:30,790
issues of requirements on suit I just

2035
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,760
wanted to have a brief conversation

2036
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:36,280
today about how we might capture those

2037
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,900
requirements so that you know suits not

2038
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,250
gonna work on the manifest forever we

2039
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:41,589
need to make sure that as we're

2040
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:43,510
finishing it up we have addressed

2041
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:45,640
everything so I'd like to have some

2042
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:47,500
discussion about a mechanism you need

2043
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:49,990
that now or later I'm I'm good either

2044
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:51,490
way but I think it's worth in this

2045
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:53,980
working group when suti talk about I

2046
01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:55,780
mean it would be useful for this working

2047
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:59,500
group to provide us with the list of

2048
01:28:55,780 --> 01:29:03,340
requirements that yeah that's what we

2049
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:05,080
were doing here this is right how formal

2050
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:08,050
process are you expecting because I

2051
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,790
thought we right yeah I mean it could be

2052
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:11,530
a wiki it could be I mean we just need

2053
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:16,630
some some place that we can go to make

2054
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:19,210
sure my action item is to take this

2055
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:20,020
slide and update it with what I've heard

2056
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:21,880
because we went through a couple

2057
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:24,670
different things that may not be on here

2058
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,840
like the I think the actually that this

2059
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:27,580
might be the complete list of things

2060
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,020
that we said might be new dependencies

2061
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:30,280
that we've never specifically asked for

2062
01:29:29,020 --> 01:29:34,150
but may or may not be there so I would

2063
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:35,679
take this slide here as the conveyance

2064
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:37,360
mechanism and carry this into the suit

2065
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:38,890
working group and present this slide as

2066
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,120
being asked from teep to say can you

2067
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:41,470
tell us whether these are already met

2068
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:44,710
and if so please if not please consider

2069
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:45,910
them and so this is the equivalent the

2070
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:47,920
wiki that you're asking right but at

2071
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:50,139
that point would we would this be the

2072
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,790
final list or will that list continue to

2073
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:53,550
change over time because if it's going

2074
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:56,200
to change you'd be useful to have some

2075
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:58,600
some authoritative place where we can

2076
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:00,309
find the latest I don't know of anything

2077
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:02,740
that would change because there's a

2078
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:04,540
bunch of issues filed the document is

2079
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:08,530
getting close as far as the technical

2080
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:10,750
issues go and it was a new issue III

2081
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:12,759
wouldn't close it into saying this is

2082
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:17,170
the final list so one of the things that

2083
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:20,440
we could do is I'm just wondering if we

2084
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:24,630
could list it as a suit requirements

2085
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:30,750
issues and then give the suit

2086
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:32,250
I don't know who access to the so we're

2087
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:34,560
running our issue tracker through github

2088
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:36,770
yes you could tag you can tag an issue

2089
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:40,530
as a suit issue or something like that

2090
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:41,850
so will that work yeah I think the suit

2091
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:43,530
serious would like to look ahead to say

2092
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:45,270
how do we get the suit manifest to last

2093
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:46,679
call what is the process and the

2094
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:48,420
timeline for doing that is kind of what

2095
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,920
Dave is asking that's right and the

2096
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:53,850
other thing to think about too is like

2097
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:56,340
what extensibility will teep need in the

2098
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:58,020
suit manifest to address anything beyond

2099
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:00,450
that that's something we should have a

2100
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:02,370
conversation at some point previous T

2101
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:04,349
interim meeting that was in the first

2102
01:31:02,370 --> 01:31:06,000
half of this year sometime Brendan Brent

2103
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:07,590
Brennan gave a presentation on the suit

2104
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,750
manifest the teep working group and

2105
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:11,640
explained yep I think everything's you

2106
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:13,350
guys are doing could be used to the suit

2107
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,670
manifest could be used for and at that

2108
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,020
time other thing that we had talked

2109
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:17,730
about as a requirement he thought was

2110
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,950
already met these are things we did not

2111
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:21,450
talk about there and so they may or may

2112
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:23,490
not already be met and what he has right

2113
01:31:21,450 --> 01:31:25,950
now but we have had discussions with

2114
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:31,920
Brendan's for almost a year now yeah

2115
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:34,950
okay so so is it sufficient then for so

2116
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:36,840
a couple things so Dave now is the

2117
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:41,400
architecture editor and issue tracker

2118
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:44,160
you can either tag them one by one or

2119
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:49,019
create a general one to get it

2120
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:50,309
kick-started if you will right so since

2121
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:52,710
these are requirements for the suit

2122
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:54,870
manifest we could do these by filing

2123
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:56,580
github it since is that the suit

2124
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:58,200
manifest is in github we could file

2125
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:59,600
github issues against the suit manifest

2126
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:04,740
draft and tag them as teep

2127
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:06,840
that would be fine - is that okay Hannes

2128
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:10,230
you're in the room is that okay with the

2129
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:13,170
manifest authors suit manifest didn't

2130
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:14,459
get help right now yes okay then we

2131
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:15,990
could use github issues on the suit

2132
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:18,030
manifest document okay let's do that

2133
01:32:15,990 --> 01:32:20,160
okay yeah is that the preference okay

2134
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:22,920
can we note that in in the etherpad

2135
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:24,690
notes please who's ever taking notes

2136
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:26,580
Thanks all right so we ready to move on

2137
01:32:24,690 --> 01:32:29,099
to the rest discussion data station

2138
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:31,740
discussions yes may now have 27 minutes

2139
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:35,580
lastly I'll continue to hold you until

2140
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:36,330
you tell me to stop yeah and if we don't

2141
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:39,540
get through everything

2142
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:43,000
if there's spare time there's

2143
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:44,560
all right all right here's access

2144
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,030
station there's at least three issues

2145
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:48,010
that are related to a test station that

2146
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:49,480
our comments on the attestation text in

2147
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:50,560
the document and now that we've said

2148
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,540
we're not going to do a test a ssin

2149
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:55,000
hopefully a lot of this is can be

2150
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:57,690
addressed by removing text and replacing

2151
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:01,510
least of reference to rats things and so

2152
01:32:57,690 --> 01:33:03,460
for example 17 is about say is about

2153
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:05,920
this notion of attestation key that

2154
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:07,420
might not be available because it is it

2155
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,320
a bunch of discretion on attestation

2156
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:13,180
keys 31 is talking about seeds for

2157
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:16,019
attestation the attestation hierarchy

2158
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:21,010
says I wanted details why the hesitation

2159
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:22,780
70 has talking about the text has the

2160
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:24,850
tea parka texture has discussions of

2161
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:26,230
specific crypto algorithms and which

2162
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:27,580
versions of which crypto algorithms are

2163
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:30,160
okay which is also details about

2164
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:31,809
attestation and in point was that list

2165
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:35,559
can get out of data over time and maybe

2166
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:37,300
the informative architecture document is

2167
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,770
not the right place to have normative

2168
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,780
requirements around crypto algorithms

2169
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:44,350
that's what that one says so all this is

2170
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:46,059
about problems that existing text with

2171
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:47,740
the agreement that the tea protocol

2172
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:50,380
should just depend on stuff coming out

2173
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:51,790
of rats the proposal is that the arc doc

2174
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:53,110
and students did explain the

2175
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:55,480
relationship between t p-- and

2176
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:57,790
attestation reference the rats

2177
01:33:55,480 --> 01:34:01,540
architecture and we've all the protocol

2178
01:33:57,790 --> 01:34:03,790
details to to either the t protocol spec

2179
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:05,730
if it's a tea protocol issue or to

2180
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:09,430
arrest thing if it's a rats issue and

2181
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:10,750
specifically text it would be removed it

2182
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:13,450
would be information talking about

2183
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:15,910
anything being signed by an SS station

2184
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:17,080
key or seating of attestation keys or a

2185
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:19,300
specific crypto algorithms for

2186
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:21,880
attestation all that text would just go

2187
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:26,470
away that's the proposal

2188
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:27,760
I see nods any objections saying we're

2189
01:34:26,470 --> 01:34:29,530
gonna keep it I'll keep all the

2190
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,240
attestation details out of here and just

2191
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:34,900
explain in relationship to rads and

2192
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,980
leave it to rats just reference rats by

2193
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,870
reference whether it's to the

2194
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:39,730
architecture document or to a specific

2195
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:42,040
solution proposal if that becomes

2196
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:43,360
relevant so yeah but that would be more

2197
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:46,110
likely from the tea protocol to

2198
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:50,160
reference a specific solution

2199
01:34:46,110 --> 01:34:52,290
Lauren slim blade co-author of the

2200
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:56,070
document in rats

2201
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:58,980
so on the the first of the the the keys

2202
01:34:56,070 --> 01:35:03,139
and seating and all that that makes some

2203
01:34:58,980 --> 01:35:05,730
sense to me the crypto algorithms I'm

2204
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:10,740
think we're gonna leave that a lot to

2205
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:14,459
profile documents and I don't know how

2206
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:16,860
the profile documents get factored like

2207
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:18,900
I don't know if the rats working group

2208
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:21,929
what profile documents the rats working

2209
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:23,580
group will construct and I don't know

2210
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:26,400
whether they will be suitable for keep

2211
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:28,800
and probably wouldn't be something we

2212
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:31,349
would want to do so you might want to

2213
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:34,410
actually have a profile document for

2214
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:38,310
keep yes you write our charter says we

2215
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:40,530
will but it's not the architecture

2216
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:42,480
document correct so yes we've already

2217
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:43,950
accepted that as they asked from rats we

2218
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,299
said yes we will do that and so there's

2219
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:49,920
a bullet or a line or something that was

2220
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:53,610
added to the Charter yes your Manya mall

2221
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:55,920
so a co-editor of the rats deliverable

2222
01:35:53,610 --> 01:36:00,059
the MT attestation token token document

2223
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:02,700
um is continuing on continue on with the

2224
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:05,190
you know a teep specific profile for

2225
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:07,620
attestation I guess um one of the things

2226
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:09,269
I struggle with while reviewing while

2227
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:12,450
reviewing the arc the T parka texture

2228
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:13,950
was what concepts are so fundamental

2229
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:17,790
they should form claim profiles within

2230
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:19,500
the eat document itself one thing and

2231
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:22,890
when one thing is an example could be

2232
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:27,200
for instance identifiers on the device

2233
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:31,830
that are service provider specific I can

2234
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:34,170
we just do is the proper way forward not

2235
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:36,120
to be not to address keep specific

2236
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:38,280
aspects of attestation

2237
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,720
within the rat's working group and have

2238
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,750
it be addressed all within that t

2239
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:44,130
profile including for instance

2240
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:45,810
identifiers that could be customized on

2241
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:48,390
a service provider basis rather than

2242
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:53,430
that identifier is it or does that are

2243
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:59,970
universal across the device are you

2244
01:36:53,430 --> 01:37:01,440
nursing on Twitter okay my opinion I

2245
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:04,500
don't know what other editors opinion is

2246
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:05,339
is that in general the answer I would

2247
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:08,040
say is yeah

2248
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:11,219
all the details should be in a teep

2249
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:14,070
claims profile stuff there may be cases

2250
01:37:11,219 --> 01:37:17,940
where if there's some decision that's

2251
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:20,369
made within rats of which teep is a user

2252
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:22,619
of you might want to then the rat should

2253
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:24,480
be free to say an example of something

2254
01:37:22,619 --> 01:37:26,869
would use this as the t p-- mechanism

2255
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:29,428
and so you might use it as an example

2256
01:37:26,869 --> 01:37:31,170
okay and so i don't want to preclude

2257
01:37:29,429 --> 01:37:32,760
rats or ever mentioning t p-- because it

2258
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:34,409
might be useful by way of example just

2259
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:36,360
like we have various examples in the t

2260
01:37:34,409 --> 01:37:37,440
parka texture like couple platform an

2261
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:39,389
example that i showed before

2262
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,848
yeah i think i have a similar stance

2263
01:37:39,389 --> 01:37:43,619
which is you know gary in lawrence you

2264
01:37:41,849 --> 01:37:46,590
should not feel obligated to include

2265
01:37:43,619 --> 01:37:48,570
anything too specific in the rats

2266
01:37:46,590 --> 01:37:50,460
working group documents i mean if you

2267
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:52,320
think that there's something that we're

2268
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:54,750
doing that has a more general utility

2269
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:57,239
and you think on your normal criteria

2270
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:59,880
for including widely used claims or

2271
01:37:57,239 --> 01:38:01,290
whatnot in the eat document by all means

2272
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:03,119
do that but don't feel like you're

2273
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:07,409
obligated to have anything specifically

2274
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:08,969
for us all right two analogies one

2275
01:38:07,409 --> 01:38:10,739
secure domain level in sweet manifest

2276
01:38:08,969 --> 01:38:12,360
industry domain we said we're gonna

2277
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:13,769
remove it from any formal concept but

2278
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:15,239
we're gonna still reference it by way of

2279
01:38:13,770 --> 01:38:16,590
example is if you have a security domain

2280
01:38:15,239 --> 01:38:20,098
here's how you can use our stuff okay

2281
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:21,449
that's as great an example what was

2282
01:38:20,099 --> 01:38:24,810
other example i just said i was going to

2283
01:38:21,449 --> 01:38:26,339
have the the suit manifest so we said if

2284
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:28,050
we have some requirements were passing a

2285
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:29,389
suit and suit put some of those rooms

2286
01:38:28,050 --> 01:38:32,310
has a way to meet those requirements

2287
01:38:29,389 --> 01:38:34,440
that keep is currently the only user of

2288
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:36,179
those then the suit manifest should be

2289
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:38,610
able to say an example of a reason why

2290
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:41,280
that would use this is because they're

2291
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:42,659
going to be used by the t protocol they

2292
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,830
should be allowed to say that yeah and

2293
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:44,940
so i'm just giving you the same answer I

2294
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:48,929
would use if Brennan asked me the same

2295
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:53,909
question for the super manifest we

2296
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:57,050
should move on okay next one the

2297
01:38:53,909 --> 01:39:00,089
document still has some text here about

2298
01:38:57,050 --> 01:39:02,040
saying that the TAM needs to actually

2299
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:03,389
validate the device search rights and so

2300
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:05,460
basically the device cert is basically

2301
01:39:03,389 --> 01:39:07,050
the SS station informations so you can

2302
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:09,139
think of the device cert here if you're

2303
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:11,849
a rats person you can think of this as

2304
01:39:09,139 --> 01:39:14,190
relying party validation of attestation

2305
01:39:11,849 --> 01:39:16,320
results that would be my generic rats

2306
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:18,239
phrasing of the title here okay and so

2307
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,199
the document currently has some stuff

2308
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:22,018
saying you know

2309
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:24,360
should be validated by at am with you

2310
01:39:22,019 --> 01:39:26,760
know such-and-such and you're gonna ask

2311
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:29,880
why is that I should be validated and

2312
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:31,289
not a must be validated that's his

2313
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:34,499
question okay

2314
01:39:31,289 --> 01:39:37,079
so it'd be like saying if the document

2315
01:39:34,499 --> 01:39:41,099
in a rat's document said a relying party

2316
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:43,139
should validate attestation results from

2317
01:39:41,099 --> 01:39:44,670
a verifier and you're going to ask why

2318
01:39:43,139 --> 01:39:46,050
is that should or not must that would be

2319
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:49,709
an equivalent question this is just the

2320
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:51,630
tip and sensation so we could remove

2321
01:39:49,709 --> 01:39:52,979
discussion of what a relying party does

2322
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:54,989
and just sort of incorporate that by

2323
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:56,159
reference that when rat specifies what

2324
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:57,570
relying parties do with that test

2325
01:39:56,159 --> 01:40:00,570
station results that will just

2326
01:39:57,570 --> 01:40:02,579
automatically apply we could leave the

2327
01:40:00,570 --> 01:40:03,840
shrewdest as is but elaborate on why so

2328
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:05,159
those protects would be similar but we

2329
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:09,019
just answer you're against questions in

2330
01:40:05,159 --> 01:40:11,699
here or you change it to must okay

2331
01:40:09,019 --> 01:40:12,719
benkei doc so i think there's maybe two

2332
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:14,909
things going on here i mean there's

2333
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:17,400
there's validating that you know it's

2334
01:40:14,909 --> 01:40:19,679
signed by a trusted thing and changed up

2335
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:21,239
properly and then there's the the rest

2336
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,659
of the sentence which is about is the

2337
01:40:21,239 --> 01:40:26,459
revocation information yeah and i think

2338
01:40:23,659 --> 01:40:28,348
what you know you looking at the

2339
01:40:26,459 --> 01:40:29,729
sentence and you know if i was to you

2340
01:40:28,349 --> 01:40:31,979
guys you're here or something on it I

2341
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:35,729
would say the intent of this is probably

2342
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:38,630
that you have to do any revocation

2343
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:41,400
checking that your eco system requires

2344
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:42,929
CRLs and OCSP are like the common ways

2345
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:44,489
to do that so we say you should do those

2346
01:40:42,929 --> 01:40:46,170
but if you have some other way of

2347
01:40:44,489 --> 01:40:49,199
checking revocation information or you

2348
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:50,909
know that there will no be there will

2349
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:53,190
never be any replication information in

2350
01:40:50,909 --> 01:40:54,719
your particular deployment then

2351
01:40:53,190 --> 01:40:56,308
obviously you don't have to check the CL

2352
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,780
because isn't one and so that's where

2353
01:40:56,309 --> 01:40:59,760
the should comes in which is that this

2354
01:40:57,780 --> 01:41:01,978
is the common way to do the operation

2355
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,849
that you're required to do but if you

2356
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:05,190
have a different way to do that

2357
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:07,320
operation you can still do that I hear

2358
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:09,209
you're arguing for number two and I

2359
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:10,978
would use the audio from what you just

2360
01:41:09,209 --> 01:41:14,099
said in the recording as the elaborate

2361
01:41:10,979 --> 01:41:16,889
on why to put into text okay and yeah

2362
01:41:14,099 --> 01:41:18,690
just please also be clear that there's a

2363
01:41:16,889 --> 01:41:22,079
distinction between checking revocation

2364
01:41:18,690 --> 01:41:23,690
information and validating the signature

2365
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:29,340
chain yep

2366
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:32,969
okay hold on Ming Ming you're on yes yes

2367
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:36,960
I also second a number to answer that

2368
01:41:32,969 --> 01:41:39,660
most upon my origin of text here yes

2369
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,640
first one for first margin no that

2370
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:44,190
addressed right it will be limited by

2371
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:45,900
that all the time seen a server site but

2372
01:41:44,190 --> 01:41:47,580
it is to my certificate check is just

2373
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:50,099
standing away right license standard way

2374
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:52,620
to chicken over vacation I would like to

2375
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:58,199
leave it there just explain the shirt

2376
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:59,820
part for two people for two so far so if

2377
01:41:58,199 --> 01:42:02,040
you're gonna object it to speak up

2378
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:05,210
otherwise choose the leaning so far

2379
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:07,410
go ahead Torrance so I'm not sure I

2380
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:11,670
would line up with any of those options

2381
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:14,430
or maybe it's one this well you're

2382
01:42:11,670 --> 01:42:18,150
presuming x.509 certificate chains here

2383
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:22,820
we are not presuming that in e Arats

2384
01:42:18,150 --> 01:42:24,750
and this has a lot to do with the

2385
01:42:22,820 --> 01:42:27,960
manufacturing and other issues of

2386
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:29,580
putting attestation keys into chips and

2387
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:33,150
devices which is not a straightforward

2388
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:35,070
thing at all so the expectation is that

2389
01:42:33,150 --> 01:42:37,080
some some people might even put

2390
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:41,009
symmetric keys in and have some sort of

2391
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:42,300
a web service that that you submit to

2392
01:42:41,010 --> 01:42:44,580
the chip bender and they'll tell you

2393
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:46,920
with something as valid or not so it

2394
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:48,690
seems like you have to leave a big open

2395
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,820
space there for how that kind of

2396
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:53,190
validation is going to happen and maybe

2397
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:56,429
it's URLs may be weak or maybe we you

2398
01:42:53,190 --> 01:42:59,460
know reinvent and and it's all seal or

2399
01:42:56,430 --> 01:43:00,690
base certificates and stick we call them

2400
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:02,070
something else I mean it seems like

2401
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:04,139
there's a whole range of stuff here so

2402
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:06,960
I'm not sure which option I'm picking

2403
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:09,120
but that's the comment you're making me

2404
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:12,830
realize that the text that I'm pulling

2405
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:15,809
from here I think this is partly what

2406
01:43:12,830 --> 01:43:17,910
Ben was saying is that some of the text

2407
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:19,440
here can apply independent of

2408
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:21,360
attestation it's just whatever are the

2409
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:23,699
certificates that the tea protocol is

2410
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,989
using for its own authentication or

2411
01:43:23,699 --> 01:43:27,929
encryption or whatever which might be

2412
01:43:24,989 --> 01:43:30,540
separate from the attestation part but

2413
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:33,800
for the SS station I get your point if t

2414
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:33,800
p-- is using x.509

2415
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:48,330
Russ house dad's gonna say a lot of that

2416
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:51,780
with the dependency on SCO's a and so on

2417
01:43:48,330 --> 01:43:53,640
this seems very P kicks oriented it's

2418
01:43:51,780 --> 01:43:58,980
also full of shins and mus that we just

2419
01:43:53,640 --> 01:44:02,040
said we aren't going to use that is true

2420
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:03,150
yes I creating the slot I couldn't

2421
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:07,590
presume the answer to the previous slide

2422
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:10,559
yes you're right the son is um mmm

2423
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:13,460
yeah I think that was very good input so

2424
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:16,170
I it seems that we have to revisit this

2425
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:20,700
section or this paragraph altogether

2426
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:23,160
because I when Ben came to the mic this

2427
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:25,800
um the shoot was exactly there because

2428
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:28,320
of those the qualifications of the CLS

2429
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:32,880
and o'seas OCSP but indeed this we

2430
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:35,790
switched over to to use some of those

2431
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:40,050
other techniques like the cozy and and

2432
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:43,320
Jose stuff we should also think about

2433
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:47,070
whether we really rely only on x.509

2434
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:50,190
certificates and specifically also keep

2435
01:44:47,070 --> 01:44:52,620
in mind now that we untangle sort of the

2436
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:55,710
attestation work from the use of

2437
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:57,599
potentially a different key for the

2438
01:44:55,710 --> 01:45:00,090
protocol messages I think that needs to

2439
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:04,440
be brought out a little bit more clearly

2440
01:45:00,090 --> 01:45:07,140
and they may they may not even be the

2441
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:10,879
same types of key you may use x.509

2442
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:14,520
certificate for one versus sort of a

2443
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:17,820
something else in the other fly cairo

2444
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,260
public use it so I'm gonna based on Russ

2445
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:22,019
is coming I'm gonna add a number four

2446
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:24,990
there and see what people think number

2447
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:26,670
four would be to move the discussion to

2448
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:31,050
the tea protocol spec and keep it out of

2449
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:35,340
the architecture document I saw two

2450
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:36,570
thumbs up from Russ because this is the

2451
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:38,430
point about if we're not going to use

2452
01:45:36,570 --> 01:45:39,929
the normative must should maze in here

2453
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:41,850
does it make sense for these to use

2454
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:43,650
motion as if so the tea protocol aspect

2455
01:45:41,850 --> 01:45:44,820
is a better place for that and so

2456
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:46,530
everything we just said would still

2457
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:49,650
apply we just applied to Hannes his

2458
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:52,380
presentation instead of mine so in the

2459
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:54,239
interest of time any objection

2460
01:45:52,380 --> 01:46:00,989
number four and making me the problem

2461
01:45:54,239 --> 01:46:04,110
the other doc okay we may need to okay

2462
01:46:00,989 --> 01:46:05,940
do your other issues tomorrow okay but I

2463
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:10,909
can finish the right section yeah all

2464
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:13,830
right this is the rats profile point

2465
01:46:10,909 --> 01:46:15,420
that Lauren brought up there is no issue

2466
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:16,650
in github yeah this is the only slide

2467
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:18,810
that I have that no github issue was

2468
01:46:16,650 --> 01:46:21,269
filed yet and there's none that's filed

2469
01:46:18,810 --> 01:46:23,010
yet because it wasn't obvious before and

2470
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:25,590
that's part of the question here is is

2471
01:46:23,010 --> 01:46:27,120
there any change as what document would

2472
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:28,860
you file it against or is it just in an

2473
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:32,159
in a new document so here the question

2474
01:46:28,860 --> 01:46:33,809
is whether and to what extent the

2475
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:38,879
architecture document should talk about

2476
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:40,980
this concept okay so to you that if you

2477
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:43,710
are new to the rat's discussion here in

2478
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:46,110
order to use rats work you need a list

2479
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:48,570
of what claims that a tam is expecting

2480
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:50,099
to come in now if you look in the OT R P

2481
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:51,690
protocol spec where it does add that

2482
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,280
station itself you'll find a bunch of

2483
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:54,989
specific elements that's in there that

2484
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:56,580
could be used to help generate that list

2485
01:46:54,989 --> 01:46:58,500
that's in a protocol spec not an

2486
01:46:56,580 --> 01:47:00,150
architecture document right so currently

2487
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:02,010
no official list exists but you could

2488
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:05,730
derive one from that and so the question

2489
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:07,920
is should the architecture doc have

2490
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:10,138
anything is it just in the tea protocol

2491
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:12,870
spec or is it in some new teep document

2492
01:47:10,139 --> 01:47:16,370
that's the rats pro the claims profile

2493
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:18,809
okay because there's no issue the

2494
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:20,940
presumed answer is anything other than

2495
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:22,500
number one but if you think it needs to

2496
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:23,638
be number one or that or that the

2497
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:25,889
architecture document should at least

2498
01:47:23,639 --> 01:47:27,239
mention the existence of this then there

2499
01:47:25,889 --> 01:47:31,650
would be something to say even if it's

2500
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:33,120
by reference to other doc okay thank you

2501
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:35,909
this feels like something that would

2502
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:39,630
pretty naturally fit into the T profile

2503
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:41,129
of the rats work correct is set a new

2504
01:47:39,630 --> 01:47:42,360
doc or is it in the protocol spec

2505
01:47:41,130 --> 01:47:44,550
there's only difference between two and

2506
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:48,030
three my preference would be three okay

2507
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:50,159
so unless do you want to get an object

2508
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:53,190
number three then the list goes in here

2509
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:55,440
and then the bullet underneath three

2510
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:57,509
that's implied is should the

2511
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:01,559
architecture document then mention its

2512
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:03,540
existence or should the architecture

2513
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:05,900
document continue to remain silent on

2514
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:05,900
this topic

2515
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:14,000
the latter is less work for us but the

2516
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:16,909
other thing main is on your on me yeah

2517
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,610
yeah yeah well actually my points are

2518
01:48:16,909 --> 01:48:20,780
 omission it even separate document

2519
01:48:19,610 --> 01:48:23,360
we need to make it right

2520
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:25,550
understand that then options three you

2521
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:28,429
put releasing a new tip document that

2522
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:30,380
are specifies us profiles but I click

2523
01:48:28,429 --> 01:48:33,610
told me she'd point it because agitation

2524
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:38,809
is a part of it and she'd point to that

2525
01:48:33,610 --> 01:48:40,790
so we have a teep milestone which we may

2526
01:48:38,809 --> 01:48:42,590
not need but the the tip milestone says

2527
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:44,750
we wanted this one of the architecture

2528
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:47,329
document to go to last call in in

2529
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:48,829
December and there's not a document to

2530
01:48:47,329 --> 01:48:50,630
reference yet is the only problem number

2531
01:48:48,829 --> 01:48:53,210
three if we wanted a reference it okay

2532
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:55,250
you could say left for future work and

2533
01:48:53,210 --> 01:48:56,750
it's because my intentions between now

2534
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:58,489
and December we will have an editor's

2535
01:48:56,750 --> 01:49:00,139
copy and then generate a new submission

2536
01:48:58,489 --> 01:49:01,489
of the internet draft and then the

2537
01:49:00,139 --> 01:49:02,570
church can then decide whether to put

2538
01:49:01,489 --> 01:49:04,009
that to work in your class call it

2539
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:08,409
follow some other process but we want to

2540
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:08,409
have a new document before December mean

2541
01:49:12,040 --> 01:49:16,369
for tomorrow

2542
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:25,219
okay by the way man that's the question

2543
01:49:16,369 --> 01:49:27,619
to all the editors we don't know yet in

2544
01:49:25,219 --> 01:49:32,210
December includes December 31st it may

2545
01:49:27,619 --> 01:49:33,980
be so so you're saying you're saying we

2546
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:45,349
would want to reference I'm just trying

2547
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:50,449
to I don't know if you can just

2548
01:49:45,349 --> 01:49:53,090
reference hey add to station' work being

2549
01:49:50,449 --> 01:49:54,558
work than rats or as long as the

2550
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:55,670
document is an informational reference

2551
01:49:54,559 --> 01:49:57,949
you can reference anything you want

2552
01:49:55,670 --> 01:50:00,230
right right so I so they I don't

2553
01:49:57,949 --> 01:50:02,509
remember what the current state of the

2554
01:50:00,230 --> 01:50:05,058
architecture document referring to the

2555
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:07,010
rats provided work in general like I

2556
01:50:05,059 --> 01:50:08,869
know where so this is it does not

2557
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:10,780
mention dress at all right now that's

2558
01:50:08,869 --> 01:50:14,420
why the issues are files so we only just

2559
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:16,309
agreed that we would use rats for the

2560
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:17,750
attestation so this is a new concept

2561
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:19,580
which is we're going through the

2562
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:21,800
architecture doing the cleanup

2563
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:24,860
I think it's probably possible to say

2564
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:27,320
something like the teep architecture

2565
01:50:24,860 --> 01:50:32,660
will make use of the rats work and will

2566
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:34,700
need to there are their options and will

2567
01:50:32,660 --> 01:50:36,230
be specified in the future document but

2568
01:50:34,700 --> 01:50:39,380
yeah we I don't think we need a specific

2569
01:50:36,230 --> 01:50:40,910
reference you don't even need a

2570
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:43,460
reference and they're different yeah

2571
01:50:40,910 --> 01:50:44,540
that's the end of my rats issues and so

2572
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:47,150
I think I'm gonna hand it back to the

2573
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:52,490
chair now yeah so my question is I see

2574
01:50:47,150 --> 01:50:54,980
three issues left and you have eight and

2575
01:50:52,490 --> 01:50:56,450
a half minutes left do you think you can

2576
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:57,559
cover them an eight and a half minutes I

2577
01:50:56,450 --> 01:51:00,290
don't remember what the three issues are

2578
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:04,250
I think so one was an editorial net the

2579
01:51:00,290 --> 01:51:06,410
second one was api's and I don't know it

2580
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:09,290
depends on whether people have have

2581
01:51:06,410 --> 01:51:11,269
questions okay so the question I'll

2582
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:14,210
leave it to you is whether you just want

2583
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:18,890
to cover them in a group or we can do as

2584
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:20,420
many until we run out of time I'm okay

2585
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:21,830
going until the top of the hour and then

2586
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:25,940
let's do that as often and see where

2587
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:30,890
we're at okay okay okay

2588
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:34,849
issue number 11 was having a common way

2589
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:38,330
to coordinate between the transport spec

2590
01:51:34,850 --> 01:51:40,460
and the protocol spec such that the

2591
01:51:38,330 --> 01:51:42,080
transport specs names for events that

2592
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:44,090
get passed between those two things has

2593
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:45,950
a common name so when you do it the two

2594
01:51:44,090 --> 01:51:47,270
specs you know this one signals the BLA

2595
01:51:45,950 --> 01:51:48,769
event and every one was when the BLA

2596
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:50,450
event is signaled something happens that

2597
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:51,620
you have a common name for handoff

2598
01:51:50,450 --> 01:51:55,670
between the two specs in this working

2599
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:58,010
group and so we did that that there is

2600
01:51:55,670 --> 01:52:00,830
this notion of conceptual API so like a

2601
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:03,200
name for an event if you will and so

2602
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:06,980
right now the list is in the github

2603
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:09,290
issue pull request 74 so the github

2604
01:52:06,980 --> 01:52:11,809
issue number 11 the per request 74 and

2605
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:14,810
in the transport spec but not in the

2606
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:16,460
protocol spec other than the OTR PE spec

2607
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:18,020
had one of them but not in the T

2608
01:52:16,460 --> 01:52:22,280
protocol spec right that's a separate

2609
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:24,740
issue here so here was for labels for

2610
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:26,120
events instead of process okay P message

2611
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:28,460
you can see it's processed teep message

2612
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:30,140
that was recently changed and so this is

2613
01:52:28,460 --> 01:52:32,210
saying here's a pull request that just

2614
01:52:30,140 --> 01:52:33,340
explicitly list these in its discussion

2615
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:35,260
about how brokerage were

2616
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:37,840
that says here's a couple of events that

2617
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:41,410
kind of happen and these are used to

2618
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:44,950
refer together between the T Protocol

2619
01:52:41,410 --> 01:52:47,050
spec and the T over HTTP spec uses these

2620
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:49,150
events as the interface between those

2621
01:52:47,050 --> 01:52:50,950
this is just abstract here's the name of

2622
01:52:49,150 --> 01:52:53,589
the event something happens when a

2623
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:55,800
connection comes in you know the or when

2624
01:52:53,590 --> 01:52:58,630
an error happens and so on so this is

2625
01:52:55,800 --> 01:53:00,370
all the ones here I claim our roughly

2626
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:04,690
editorial and so we're just going to do

2627
01:53:00,370 --> 01:53:12,010
those unless there's objections let the

2628
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:14,679
editorials go yeah this one last IETF we

2629
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:17,050
had a presentation at the very end from

2630
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:21,280
Soren I don't know if Serena's here yeah

2631
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:22,990
the use of IOT DDoS draft issues there

2632
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:25,059
was his presentation is about things

2633
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:29,110
like that Moriah botnet would infect IOT

2634
01:53:25,060 --> 01:53:31,270
devices and his question was can t poor

2635
01:53:29,110 --> 01:53:34,360
the working group or whatever it be used

2636
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:37,420
to help prevent those DDoS attacks these

2637
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:39,309
DDoS attacks are really about getting

2638
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:41,860
mail were on to the rich execution

2639
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:43,840
execution environment of the device not

2640
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:48,339
the te of the device least the ones that

2641
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:49,990
are discussed there and so since we did

2642
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:51,790
not have time for that discussion last

2643
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:52,960
time this would be the chance to discuss

2644
01:53:51,790 --> 01:53:56,110
that and maybe we do want to move this

2645
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,790
one a tomorrow yeah the last one is

2646
01:53:56,110 --> 01:53:59,320
editorial only this is a list of things

2647
01:53:57,790 --> 01:54:00,730
that I don't think we need discussion

2648
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:04,389
that somebody else says that we do and

2649
01:54:00,730 --> 01:54:05,889
so this is the last slide then so I

2650
01:54:04,390 --> 01:54:07,900
think you just moved the one issue I'll

2651
01:54:05,890 --> 01:54:10,510
update the agenda so tomorrow we'll

2652
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:12,730
start by the discussion of this last of

2653
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:13,750
the one issue yeah and one issue I know

2654
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:18,009
a certain can be there

2655
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:20,080

2658
01:54:26,260 --> 01:54:37,840
anyway sorry are you there okay

2659

2660
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:44,200
it off if not okay we can defer okay so

2661
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:50,590
with that we will reconvene again

2662

2664
01:54:56,410 --> 01:55:01,900
proposed so I'll ask the question

2665

we hope to be the next not next but the

2667
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:09,730

2668
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:12,880
the focus for tomorrow and a couple of

2669

announcements as well as updates from

2670
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:17,260
the transport protocol by Dave so with

2671
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:20,049
that I'll let you guys go

2672
