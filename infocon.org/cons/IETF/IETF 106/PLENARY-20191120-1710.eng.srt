1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:12,510
hello can you hear me yes I got a no and

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,690
a yes from two people sitting within 5

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:19,020
feet of each other so that's interesting

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:23,189
could be louder I am not really in

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,950
control of it stand closer I'm just

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:33,329
gonna win with this just do the whole

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:37,649
plenary like this all right welcome

8
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:40,589
everyone to the IETF 1:06 administrative

9
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,359
and operations plenary there's food in

10
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:44,190
the hallway but all of you made the

11
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,659
right choice to come inside rather than

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,140
eating the food we had a really great

13
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:54,809
plan for this meeting we knew that there

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,120
would be lots of contentious topics on

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,640
the agenda this week people may have

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,339
heard we're trying to encrypt the DNS

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,190
transports the spring working group

18
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:08,039
needed 17 hours of meeting time to talk

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,439
about segment routing or so many

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,570
contentious topics though that we knew

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,619
would be coming so you planned the

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,000
meeting in a very hot place knowing

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,119
people would bring all their summer

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,840
clothes and then we froze the meeting

25
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,340
rooms but the idea being that if you're

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,479
really cold you don't wanna spend a lot

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,009
of time arguing you just want to get to

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,210
the end so you can go back outside and

29
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,359
warm up well we were thwarted in this

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,619
plan because but delightful people at

31
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:42,538
the Secretariat brought blankets handed

32
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,359
them out to people and as a result we've

33
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:47,789
had to actually debate and fight to the

34
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,609
bitter end to achieve the consensus that

35
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:52,500
we all are seeking here in the ITF but

36
00:01:50,609 --> 00:02:02,939

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:07,200

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,100
the arc Science Museum yesterday yeah I

69
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,989
think it's kind of cool to have our

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,769
social event in the museum setting

71
00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:02,440
listening so my name is Kent well I had

72
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:05,799
the IP optic routing group for Nokia for

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,690
Asia Pacific since this is the first

74
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,910
time I think the new note here's host

75
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:13,660
this event I thought I would just make

76
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,358
two quick pod first one some of you may

77
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,750
ask what does Nokia have to do with IETF

78
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,450
don't you guys just make handset phone

79
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,830
believe me my colleagues and I still got

80
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,070
asked this question from time to time

81
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,140
when we toil friends will work for Nokia

82
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,030
eternal in the last 15 16 years of

83
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,199
industry consolidation merger

84
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,659
acquisition

85
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,969
when Nokia is now a collection of many

86
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:39,520
different technology and companies one

87
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:42,039
example solved the Kali here in the room

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,919
and myself we joined we are from the

89
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,199
Nokia IP routing group which originated

90
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,169
is technology from a start-up in Silicon

91
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,469
Valley called high Metro a magical

92
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:57,580
qualified Alcatel in 2003 alcatel-lucent

93
00:04:53,469 --> 00:05:00,550
merge in 2006 and Nokia

94
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,859
acquired alcatel-lucent in 2015 so this

95
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,229
is just one example and of course

96
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,319
through the years I mean with many

97
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:10,628
colleague that from coming from parallel

98
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,719
coming from former Alcatel coming from

99
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:17,169
former loosen and formal Nokia seamen

100
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:19,748
and form a new bridge as well so I mean

101
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:22,628
today if I look around I think this year

102
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:25,150
we have close to 30 delegates from Nokia

103
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:27,759
joined IETF and I've been involved in

104
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,979
many many different standard and areas

105
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,169
we're committed to IETF and will

106
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,659
continue to support ITF activities so

107
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:38,799
there's the first part second one is a

108
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:39,339
bit more personal so I have a confession

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,029
to make

110
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:47,250
I've always wanted to attend IETF never

111
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:47,250
got the chance and this is my first time

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,169
so I remember 18 years ago when I

113
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,080
started in furniture

114
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:03,068
my first project is to implement the

115
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,948
graceful restart job for all the routing

116
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,779
protocol internet sure so at the time

117
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,210
you were still a job so I send a lot of

118
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,909
email to the idea yeah IETF not only is

119
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,770
to ask for question make some suggestion

120
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:19,659
always get good response and

121
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,359
collaboration spirit earlier this week I

122
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,580
did a look up in the IETF and I find my

123
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,629
name was in the announcements session

124
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:31,359
for the OSPF quest always the OFC so I

125
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:34,089
feel so proud to be associated to IETF

126
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,249
in a small way because you are the

127
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:39,430
organization who continue to innovate

128
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:41,469
and continue to printer events the paths

129
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,830
of technology to make the internet and

130
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,880
make the industry take so again enjoy

131
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,099
this week

132
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,500
sure you'll get a lot of productive work

133
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,330
and pressure on this way as always and

134
00:06:50,500 --> 00:07:00,880
going to print the path of technology to

135
00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:04,150
the industry thank you very much we have

136
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,170
a small token of our appreciation here a

137
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,169
nice plaque for you

138
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,789
[Music]

139
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:26,550
alright so next up is is the report from

140
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,530
myself the ITF chair and from the is she

141
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,370
I'm gonna keep it brief this time trying

142
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,809
to keep the plenary a bit snappier will

143
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:40,170
go through some participant statistics

144
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,170
and then an update on conduct in the ITF

145
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,429
so here at ITF 106 we have actually one

146
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,560
more participant who registered since we

147
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:56,260
created this slide earlier today so we

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,090
have 999 people on-site well I hear

149
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,480
we're gonna break a hundred thousand

150
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,130
sometimes people register late super

151
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,380
late in the week so we should be hitting

152
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,050
a thousand by the end of the week and we

153
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,840
have 147 first time attendees here with

154
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:14,830
us and attendees from 61 different

155
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:21,099
countries about on par with last time we

156
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:22,479
met in Asia for ITF 103 it's the end of

157
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,330
the year so I thought it might be nice

158
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,850
to do a little bit of a look back over

159
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,099
the last couple of years here you can

160
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,950
see that participation numbers the

161
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,650
attendance numbers for the last two

162
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,630
years worth of meetings the last two

163
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,610
each of the last two years were fairly

164
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,159
similar to each other and you can see

165
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,080
the pattern there fairly similar

166
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,699
attendance numbers and we've met in the

167
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,590
same region at the same time of year for

168
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:53,680
the last two years so there you can

169
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:56,020
compare fairly easily if we look at the

170
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,510
remote participation numbers we couldn't

171
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,430
provide numbers for 106 because a lot of

172
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,750
people register and participate later in

173
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,969
the week and we didn't want to give you

174
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,860
half of a number but you can see there

175
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,980
at least over the course of the last

176
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,410
year an upward trend and remote

177
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,660
participation and these are this is the

178
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,579
number that counts any remote

179
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,839
participant who attends at least one

180
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,840
working group remotely

181
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,300
if we look at the hackathon we also see

182
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,330
a nice upward trend there becoming a

183
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,939
more and more popular event didn't quite

184
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,280
hit our all-time high that we had in

185
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,350
Prague at this meeting but still more

186
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:45,060
than we had in the summer in Montreal

187
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:47,400
which is great and just another word on

188
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,869
the hackathon and those 300 people who

189
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,540
were in the room were working on 41

190
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,940
different projects together again this

191
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,819
year this meeting we had the hack demo

192
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,230
happy hour on Monday night where

193
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,150
individuals and teams could show off

194
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:02,570
their work for the rest of the community

195
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:06,209
who may not have been at the hackathon

196
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,820
themselves and the next Agathon that we

197
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:12,600
have planned is same again will be the

198
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,280
weekend prior to ITF 107 in Vancouver so

199
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,870
for those who haven't had a chance to

200
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,910
participate in this thus far I really

201
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,010
encourage you to come and check it out

202
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,920
the hack upon itself is is free to

203
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,410
attend and all of that work has really

204
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,939
had a major impact on the standards

205
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,969
development work that we do in the ITF

206
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,020
by creating a feedback loop with

207
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,170
implementations and the developer

208
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:40,170
community so thanks to all who've been

209
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:43,469
participating so for the last few

210
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:46,620
meetings been talking about conduct and

211
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,630
behavior in the IETF people may be aware

212
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,750
that we have a code of conduct in the

213
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,910
ITF and the objective that we strive for

214
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,410
is that everybody who comes to

215
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,110
participate is treated with dignity

216
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,800
decency and respect we want this to be a

217
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,930
welcoming place for everyone since the

218
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,000
last meeting there's a few different

219
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,130
initiatives that I've been working on

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,220
and that the isg has been has been

221
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,960
working on one is ongoing discussions

222
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,550
between the area directors and the

223
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,570
working group chair is about participant

224
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:22,260
behavior so collectively as the isg we

225
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,630
have a set of guidelines and samples of

226
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,670
good and bad behavior that we've been

227
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,170
using to have one-on-one discussions

228
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,349
with our working group chairs about how

229
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:33,089
they can foster a more collaborative and

230
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,420
friendly environment so those

231
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,420
conversations are

232
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,360
ongoing we've also been getting some

233
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,949
assistance from professional resources

234
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,420
reaching out to a few different folks

235
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:48,490
who work on conduct and conflict

236
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,380
management as their as their profession

237
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,570
and they've been helping to advise us

238
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,850
and we've been investigating other ways

239
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,459
to get further support possibly with

240
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,600
some hands-on training potentially in

241
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:02,589
time for the next meeting

242
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,170
so hoping to continue to work with those

243
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,940
people and then finally there's been a

244
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,680
few updates in the realm of the

245
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,459
sergeant-at-arms these are the people

246
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:16,599
who serve as the list moderators for

247
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:18,099
ietf at ITA org you can see them up on

248
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,899
the screen there matthew Miller and

249
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,050
Dhruv Dodi Dhruv is new to the team

250
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:25,060
since the last meeting and he's been

251
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,790
really integral of both he and Matt as

252
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,010
we've developed an engagement model for

253
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,529
the sergeant's at arm's so if you visit

254
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,730
the link there you'll see some standard

255
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,139
operating procedures that we've

256
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,360
developed for the sergeant's at arm's

257
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:39,339
some email templates that we intend to

258
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,750
use to make sure that when the

259
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:43,750
sergeant's that arms are engaging with

260
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,300
people from the IHF community that that

261
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,610
they're doing so in a consistent way and

262
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,099
communicating clearly about concerns

263
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:55,600
related to behavior on ITF at IETF

264
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,990
torgue we did put that out for community

265
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,089
review and feedback and I met this week

266
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,589
with the sergeant-at-arms team to start

267
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:04,630
reviewing some of that feedback so you

268
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:11,170
should be seeing responses to many of

269
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:13,930
those comments in the coming weeks on a

270
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,399
related note just wanted to summarize

271
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,800
for people some of the changes that have

272
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,740
occurred recently with respect to

273
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,510
mailing lists where a general IETF

274
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,120
discussion and process discussion

275
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,160
happens so we created a new mailing list

276
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,040
since the last ITF meeting called last

277
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:32,110
call at ITF org and this is where all of

278
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,969
the ITF last call discussions are now

279
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,760
happening about about documents that are

280
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,029
in last call the moderators are Jared

281
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,089
mouch and Ron Gondwana we still have

282
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,980
IETF at IETF org which is for working

283
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:46,170
group charter reviews general

284
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,440
announcements and general

285
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,050
discussion and initial kind of process

286
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,510
discussion and brainstorming about

287
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,569
process issues and there we have the

288
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,589
sergeant-at-arms whoo-hoo moderate and

289
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,019
then we have a new working group called

290
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:04,589
Gen dispatch chartered in the general

291
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:07,139
area to to provide a forum for

292
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,779
discussion of process proposals that are

293
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,910
a little bit more fleshed out so things

294
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,230
might initially begin on ITF at IETF but

295
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,569
eventually they may move to the gen

296
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,639
dispatch working group where they can be

297
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,589
discussed and then some determination is

298
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,240
made about whether they will be able

299
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,410
answered or turned into a new working

300
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,410
group or how they will be otherwise

301
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,550
handled and for that we have the working

302
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,860
group chairs who are doing the list

303
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:34,649
moderation that's Francesca Pelham B&E

304
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,480
and Pete Resnick there's lots of other

305
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:39,600
topics that we covered online I sent out

306
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,190
a report in advance of this meeting to

307
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,010
the IETF mailing list so you can check

308
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,630
out there's more information there

309
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,490
including the fact that we received no

310
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,640
Appeals in the last period since the

311
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,170
last meeting and reports from many other

312
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,380
groups and bodies that are part of the

313
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:58,019
IETF

314

332
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,080
differences between the IRT F and the

333
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:13,310
IETF RFC 74 18 it was a really nice

334
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:15,680
primer on how the IRT F works and how it

335
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:20,989
differs from an IETF working group and I

336
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:23,510
would encourage you to in addition to

337
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,880
the research groups the IETF runs the

338
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,089
applied networking research workshop in

339
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,740
cooperation with ACM signal those of you

340
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,070

awarded for recent results in applied

361
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,270
networking research

362
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,369
that are potentially relevant for

363
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,439
transitioning into the standards

364
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:26,750
community into shipping products that

365
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,790
are potentially of interest to this to

366
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:32,540
this community both the a RTF and the AE

367

papers you know looking in the area of

378
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,990
applied networking research please

379
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:08,179
consider nominating them the link is on

380
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:13,720

good afternoon everybody

383
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:46,580
this is the report from the internet

384
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:49,070
architecture board one of the jobs of

385
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,570
the IAB is to manage appointments to

386
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,700
external bodies on behalf of the IGF

387
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:54,500
community among the most important of

388
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,360
them made in the most recent period was

389
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,549
the reappointment of Adrian Farrell as

390
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,289
independent submissions editor

391
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:01,759
we thank Adrian for his two years of

392
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:04,009
service so far and for his willingness

393
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,820
to stand for an additional term

394
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:10,610
thanks very much to Adrian we have also

395
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,918
appointed Peter Cook to the ICANN NomCom

396
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:16,610
and we're seeking nominations for the

397
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:19,519
Internet Society Board of Trustees since

398
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:22,370
our email to the community you will also

399
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,320
see a new request we are also seeking

400
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,199
nominations for the ICANN governance

401
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,210
working group the gwg is part of the

402
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,090
mechanism by which I can and the root

403
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,110
server system Advisory Committee are

404
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:36,850
putting together a new governance

405
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:39,769
structure for the root server system

406
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,209
another thing the iev does is make

407
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,679
occasional public statements there was

408
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,720
one such public statement during this

409
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,580
period calling out the unintended

410
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,519
consequences of policy and regulatory

411
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,199
proposals this was originally inspired

412
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,240
by the statement that went directly to

413
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,889
the Australian government but has been

414
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,899
broadened and made more general so that

415
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:58,549
we don't have to make specific

416
00:19:56,899 --> 00:20:01,580
statements to individual governments in

417
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:03,320
the future I'm happy to report like the

418
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,500
IAS G there were no Appeals in this

419
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,480
period during this period a number of

420
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,399
documents moved to the RFC editor the

421
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,240
first four of these are cluster that

422
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:15,739
came out of the ITF is a to process

423
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,470
because the documents they were updating

424
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,110
were on the IAB stream they moved from

425
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,179
ISO to into the IEP process for

426
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,559
community review and approval and they

427
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:28,010
were all approved during this past

428
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,940
period the last one here was draft IB 50

429
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,979
years which was Heather's

430
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,549
reflections on the first 50 years of the

431
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:38,049
RFC series there are a number of other

432
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,820
documents that are either in preparation

433
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:43,450
or currently in community review which

434
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,340
is the equivalent of last call draft IAB

435
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,869
for the users the internet is for

436
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,509
end-users and the harmful consequences

437
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:50,709
of the robustness principle principles

438
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:52,599
for operation of internet assigned

439
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,309
numbers Authority registries and long

440
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,168
term viability of protocol extension

441
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:57,609
mechanisms we look forward to your

442
00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,529
comments on those either directly to the

443
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:03,939
IAB or to the architectural disgust list

444
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:05,799
there are two workshop reports currently

445
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,599
in preparation the first is for the

446
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,849
design expectations first deployment

447
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,249
realities or deader workshop and the

448
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:13,809
second is for the exploring synergy

449
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:18,570
between content aggregation and the

450
00:21:13,809 --> 00:21:18,570
publisher ecosystem or escape workshop

451
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:23,320
lastly is all of you know the ID has a

452
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:26,619
number of programs among them are suck

453
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,928
as a management program the IB received

454
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,139
an Esso W from our sock for the

455
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,899
temporary RFC editor project manager

456
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:36,008
after their community consultation

457
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:38,799
during his past period and has

458
00:21:36,009 --> 00:21:40,929
tremendous transmitted to the ITF LLC on

459
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:47,168
October 2nd this is now moved into a

460
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:49,389
different phase of the the s ou W an RFP

461
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,759
process then is managed by the IAB but

462
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:53,258
just for your information the proposals

463
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,259
received are being considered now with

464
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:58,149
the proposed start in January in

465
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:00,669
addition the IAB is assisting Heather on

466
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:03,728
the output of the RAC me community

467
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:06,159
discussions and she is up next to tell

468
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:20,950
you more about this and other RFC editor

469
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:26,470
topics you're also quiet

470
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:29,889
did you hibernate in the cold no okay um

471
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:33,580
have a fine again RC series editor for a

472
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:37,498
little while I'm getting just gonna go

473
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:40,509
through a couple of quick updates um so

474
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:42,190
you know what I would ask how many of

475
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:44,670
you are aware that we are working on

476
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:50,880
changing the RFC format

477
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:54,090
what some some well if you're not we

478
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:58,080
need to talk um because it's already

479
00:22:54,090 --> 00:23:01,110
happened so we are not in in the process

480
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:07,429
of we have in fact changed the RFC

481
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:14,250
format and with the publication of RFC

482
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:17,930
86 51 on October 8 we are now in the

483
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:21,090
process of we have this huge corpus of

484
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,920
documents that all need to be converted

485
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,020
everything that was in all 48 has been

486
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,110
converted and we're now going through

487
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,360
our C editor and edicue and all those

488
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,479
other things to to get them all into v3

489
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,929
and oh we're finding so many lovely edge

490
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,000
cases of things that we have to iterate

491
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:42,060
on to figure out what's the right thing

492
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,050
with the tool etc etc this is one of the

493
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:47,370
reasons as you may recall from

494
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:51,060
conversations earlier this year that the

495
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:53,580
service level agreement is essentially

496
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,639
on hold until April so that we can we

497
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,439
can work through this process and then

498
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,050
try and get caught up on things if you

499
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,340
would like to help because one of the

500
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:04,530
things that makes this challenge as I

501
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,629
mentioned we have a nice large corpus of

502
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,480
material including things like cluster

503
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:12,320
238 it came in at the same time the

504
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:16,440
format was going live so did cluster 340

505
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,530
that's a lot of documents if you have a

506
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,990
document in cube it isn't in off 48 and

507
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,240
you would like to perhaps reach out to

508
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,670
the RFC editor and say we're willing to

509
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,800
help do the work to convert this to v3

510
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:32,670
please drop them a note and tell them

511
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,889
that if you want to know a little bit

512
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,310
more information as to what would you be

513
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:41,190
getting yourself into if you made such a

514
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:43,560
marvelous request I strongly suggest you

515
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,530
look at the FAQ that's linked to on

516
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,270
these slides it answers a lot of

517
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,820
questions that people have had about

518
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,260
well what about tables what about

519
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,710
diagrams what about all these other

520
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,990
things so it's a it's a very important

521
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:03,509
resource for you and I hope you all uh

522
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:05,580
come familiar with it um the I did not

523
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:08,159
name this session by the way I VRS eme

524
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,070
no I didn't do that but the session was

525
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,850
held yesterday morning and this was sort

526
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:17,580
of the culmination of a of virtual calls

527
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:20,490
we had three in different time zone just

528
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,869
to get as many people involved as we

529
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:27,419
could the result of these conversations

530
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:29,779
held at the on the calls in the session

531
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:33,419
and on the RFC interest mailing list is

532
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:36,809
to recommend establishing an open IEP

533
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:39,029
program that would basically drive

534
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:41,220
consensus in the community of interest

535
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:43,440
around any changes to the RFC editor

536
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,169
model if you would like to know more

537
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,940
about that I've already updated the

538
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,279
draft based on the feedback in the

539
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:53,039
session that got posted this afternoon

540
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,110
so that's out there and if you have

541
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,480
feedback on that in terms of what's

542
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,158
being proposed for moving this

543
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,460
conversation forward now would be a

544
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,669
really good time to share it because my

545
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,830
hope is that the the draft is reasonably

546
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,619
complete it's not going to be published

547
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,658
as an RFC but it's something that I

548
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:16,590
would like to be able to hand off to the

549
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,730
IB at the earliest possible moment so

550
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:22,709
that they can actually act on the

551
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:25,559
recommendations this year I mentioned

552
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:29,639
the service level agreement being on

553
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:32,519
hold until April how many of you know

554
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:36,570
that for for everything v2 and earlier

555
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:39,379
there's now annotated RFC's our SES that

556
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,970
have been annotated with verified errata

557
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:44,668
some of you know that most of you are

558
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,279
just staring at me well guess what they

559
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:49,980
are there you can get to them via the

560
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,749
data tracker if you know that there is

561
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,580
an RFC that has errata and they're not

562
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:55,769
showing make sure that the outer errata

563
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,110
are verified not hold for document

564
00:26:55,769 --> 00:27:00,360
update not anything like that and those

565
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,658
are out there um we do not have those

566
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,330
for v3 yet because there's just not that

567
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:08,700
many v3 documents at this point and it's

568
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,960
a require a little bit of a different

569
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,060
work and a different tool chain to do

570
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:18,350
that so

571
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:20,480
it is expected later and with that that

572
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,129
is my last five minutes of fame is the

573
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,120
RFC series editor I wish you all the

574
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:28,100
very very best going forward and I will

575
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:51,409
come up with the IV for questions later

576
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:54,260
thank you makes a lot of noise walking

577
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:56,660
up here alright this is a non come

578
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,040
update for this year the first thing

579
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,990
about Nam Kham is we can't talk about

580
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,680
Nam Kham actually no we can't talk about

581
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:05,450
calm all right Singapore so last ITF we

582
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,370
assembled the group of folks who will

583
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,850
slave I mean work for the community to

584
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:14,449
select the for the rolls coming up this

585
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,189
year this Nam Kham which is 106 where we

586
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,600
do all the interviews so that's us we

587
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,670
look like silhouettes when we're in the

588
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,649
room and we're interviewing all the

589
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,660
folks who put their names forward and

590
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:26,990
were willing to serve the community this

591
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,940
is a kind of a view of the process we we

592
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,940
slept we got the NomCom committee

593
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,490
together previously back in the early

594
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,640
summer we had a call for nominees as we

595
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:39,290
approach August in September we had we

596
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,540
started a call for a feedback a number

597
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:44,020
weeks ago and the green areas where we

598
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,610
are now where we're looking for feedback

599
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,320
so I may remind everyone we're looking

600
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,550
for feedback we need lots and lots of

601
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,830
feedback we need to know what you guys

602
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,149
think of all the nominees so we can make

603
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,770
the best selection possible for the

604
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:58,940
community and once we finish the

605
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:03,530
feedback period in the interview period

606
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:05,180
we move on to deliberations so just in

607
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,920
case you don't know where to put a ride

608
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,660
the feedback in the native tracker you

609
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,120
can move on to web page it looks just

610
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,800
like that under the NomCom 2019 section

611
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,479
there is a section there you can click

612
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,310
on feedback and you can provide you

613
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,210
feedback on all the nominees Summoner

614
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:22,669
nominees whatever you like and we did

615
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,970
come here ready to work we're working

616
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,100
together the NomCom is very

617
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,929
sited there's lots of opinions we're

618
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,500
moving forward we're interviewing all

619
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:34,720
the folks or having a great time so

620
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,850
who's on the NomCom if the NomCom

621
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,830
members don't mind standing up to show

622
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,840
everybody who you are these are the

623
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:43,030
folks not sure who's all there here they

624
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,770
are these are the ones who have taken

625
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,418
their time they stopped doing all the

626
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,510
other work not all their other work and

627
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,890
they're here to take your feedback

628
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,129
please please please reach out to them

629
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:56,329
in the hallways they have orange dots

630
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,329
[Applause]

631
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,428
the best way to know what happens at the

632
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,260
ITF is to be part of the NomCom you

633
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,840
learn a lot about the various positions

634
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,200
of their various roles it's a great

635
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,240
experience and we feed you so don't

636
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,370
forget that there's so much food we're

637
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,950
all going to gain five pounds so the

638
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:20,168
number of positions we have IHG

639
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,590
positions and we have IB positions

640
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:26,440
available for this cycle those are two

641
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,928
years those are for two years and this

642
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,510
year we're gonna revisit the start of

643
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:33,940
the refilling of the LLC and the trust

644
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,669
positions and those are three year

645
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,309
moving forward last year was the one and

646
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:41,799
only year where we had a 1 a 2 and a 3

647
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:44,500
year as we sat in and primed those new

648
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,600
positions but moving forward every year

649
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,340
the NomCom were refilled one of the

650
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:55,209
outgoing positions both for the board

651
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:57,189
LLC and for the ITF trust so I chart no

652
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,480
I'll just highlight a couple of things I

653
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,880
was told everyone likes numbers so I

654
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,270
have some numbers here as I noted in the

655
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,159
in the grey box areas LLC board ITF

656
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:09,010
there was three positions last year

657
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,450
moving forward we're gonna have one so

658
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,429
what are all these other numbers there's

659
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,690
been a lot of discussion about hey how

660
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:15,700
many people do we have for the various

661
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,530
positions just to highlight a couple of

662
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,940
things that we've noticed within the

663
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:22,928
NomCom just for the community to be

664
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:24,429
aware one good news is we had an amazing

665
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:27,760
number of nominations for transport the

666
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:32,090
summer out it was very very high

667
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,879
however not as many accepts so I think

668
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:38,780
for every 15 people we nominate one

669
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,000
might actually accept so so we need 45

670
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,450
next year if we want to get three all

671
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,780
right

672
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:47,840
the the purple and the black triangles

673
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,180
or not triangle started square is one

674
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,030
thing we've noticed is sometimes when

675
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:55,100
there is an incumbent who also wants to

676
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,350
you know continue to go forward there's

677
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,719
sometimes tends to be less people

678
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:03,199
willing to put their name forward for

679
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,490
that position that's one thing we've

680
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,010
noticed I'm not going to put any

681
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:08,780
qualitative analysis into that however I

682
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:11,170
think it's important for folks to know

683
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:14,090
that even incumbents want to make sure

684
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:15,860
that we have other people that are ready

685
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,300
to take position take the position

686
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,010
anyhow it's good to be part of the

687
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,350
process it's good to go through the

688
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:24,740
process and we don't know we always want

689
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:25,129
the best folks for the roles so I would

690
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,950
you know

691
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,180
don't let incumbency block one from you

692
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:31,070
know putting your name forward and

693
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,780
accepting the opportunity to serve the

694
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:35,270
community and a greater capacity it's

695
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,879
very important so what can you do

696
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,920
feedback I said it a few times I say it

697

699
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,030
very important nominate people next time

700
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,340
around obviously we're too late this

701
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,200
year but nominate yourself sometimes

702
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,610
means someone doesn't know that you are

703
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,260
willing to put your name forward so

704
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,419
please nominate yourself if that's what

705
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,910
it takes let the community know you're

706
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,740
willing to take a position and that way

707

795
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,150
great detail and I have come over my

796

797
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,570

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,560
them how to do things differently so

799
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:07,350

800
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,590
echo and all of the volunteers really

801
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,000
are quite dedicated and I think the fact

802
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,040
that they are a lot to wager in the day

803
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,390

00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,830
so we have cisco juniper Comcast NBC

825
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,540
Universal

826
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,299
Ericsson and Nokia thank you all very

827
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:23,489
much as well

828
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:26,309
[Applause]

829
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:30,079
future meeting venues we have a number

830
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:34,319
of these pin down now just a note that

831
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,180
beginning in 2022 you probably know this

832
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:39,029
better than me we are shifting the order

833
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:42,538
of the regions so that Asia is the first

834
00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:44,309
region in the year this is where we

835
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:46,170
stand so far we're currently still

836
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:48,269
looking for sponsors for some of these

837
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:51,089
meetings and we are still looking at

838
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:53,160
venues and cities so we can't yet fill

839
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:56,930
this in fully but that will be filled in

840
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,930
over time and you'll hear about that

841
00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:04,079
right so for this meeting we have had

842
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:07,200
these are the figures to show you the

843
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,999
number of participants revenue is above

844
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,499
budget

845
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:12,749
don't get excited it's not going to be

846
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:15,089
an open bar some years and sometimes

847
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:17,368
it's under sometimes it's over it's very

848
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:19,140
good that it's over but it's we have to

849
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:20,880
look it over a long term prospect for

850
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:25,319
that but it's still very good finished

851
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:29,219
this meeting registration breakdown as

852
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:31,259
you've heard we still have where we have

853
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,119
a breakdown across there of people I'll

854
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:35,789
leave that for you to have a look at I

855
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,880
think one of the things I would be

856
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:41,819
looking at is better data here for the

857
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,259
IHG so that they're able to look at this

858
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:45,569
and do something more valuable with it

859
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:49,859
but for now this is simply a table for

860
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:51,599
you so that's it thank you very much

861
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:54,058
there will be proper thanks to Porsche

862
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,079
and the board session but um thank you

863
00:40:54,059 --> 00:41:00,589

[Applause]

866
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:25,779
all right thank you I'm Jason Livengood

867
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:29,629
here from the LC board to give an update

868
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:32,690
so this is the board I believe at least

869
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:35,690
Peter is remotely participating from his

870
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:38,180
home in Belgium Maya planned to but

871
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:41,869
she's ill at the moment and ELISA and

872
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:44,118
Shawn are obviously here we have some

873
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:45,589
upcoming board meetings I won't go

874
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:48,039
through the details here what we've been

875
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:50,299
trying to do is basically publish

876
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,490
several months in advance when the board

877
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:55,099
meetings are and we invite people to

878
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:57,859
participate when we hold some of those

879
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:59,990
coincident with ITF meetings or ICANN

880
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:04,220
meetings or other meetings we welcome

881
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:07,459
people to attend in person as well so

882
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:11,240
recent work completed we have been busy

883
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:13,940
since the last meeting have importantly

884
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:17,419
gotten some some big things done first

885
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,440
obviously hired a permanent executive

886
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,779
director J who just spoke a moment ago

887
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:27,680
we also recently finalized the first

888
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:30,410
round of LLC policies and in addition we

889
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,569
filed on the website all of the conflict

890
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:36,140
of interest policies or filings excuse

891
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:38,630
me for the board members including two

892
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:41,150
additional memos pertaining to them and

893
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:45,230
some of that will be updated as things

894
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:47,150
change we also had the executive

895
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:49,069
director announced contract rewards for

896
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,950
a number of the RFPs that have been put

897
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:55,130
out including CPA that will be in place

898
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:58,160
before end of year automatic schedule

899
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:00,589
builder and in the midst of finalizing

900
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,339
the Secretariat services RFP and a

901
00:43:00,589 --> 00:43:06,049
number of others and lastly we are just

902
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:09,140
in the process of publishing and

903
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:10,999
wrapping up our 2020 budget which is

904
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,950
really the first time that we've been on

905
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:16,459
top of what our expenses actually look

906
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:18,049
like and you know a number of those from

907
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,160
the past few months so that's important

908
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:24,559
as well we certainly sent a welcome

909
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,269
email out and did a roll out announcing

910
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,269
J joining the organization we're

911
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:30,299
delighted that he's come to to work here

912
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:34,049
so thank you

913
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:37,979
for that and Portia if you could come up

914
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:39,929
please I wanted to make a moment take a

915
00:43:37,979 --> 00:43:43,589
moment excuse me to really extend our

916
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:47,249
thanks to Porsche so she has served here

917
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:49,619
as executive director since 2017 so

918
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:53,788
about two years and really provided a

919
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:56,609
bridge from the IOC or the original I

920
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:58,939
Assam model to the new model and helped

921
00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:02,640
us navigate through a time of incredible

922
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:05,339
administrative and legal uncertainty and

923
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,368
did that with the plum so we really

924
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:10,439
appreciate her efforts she's continuing

925
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:13,079
through the end of the year to help that

926
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:15,580
transition occur so I'd like to please

927
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:19,020
recognize Portia for the great work

928
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,020
[Applause]

929
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:24,329
[Music]

930
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:32,150
and we have a couple things because we

931
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,790
know that the ITF can be a real pain in

932
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:38,300
the ass or pain in the back or pain in

933
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:41,630
the neck we got you a gift of the

934
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,830
Mandarin Oriental in Washington DC if

935
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,300
you'd like to have a massage or

936
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:47,360
something like that try to work all the

937
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,630
stress of dealing with us out so thank

938
00:44:47,360 --> 00:45:08,420
you for that and we have a nice plaque a

939
00:44:49,630 --> 00:45:10,540
newly redesigned one so so what's coming

940
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,160
next between now on the next meeting

941
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,630
first while we announced the policies

942
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:16,450
that doesn't mean that they're really

943
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:19,370
enforced so we have to implement them

944
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:21,169
which essentially means roll them out

945
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:24,140
and then have a compliance program to

946
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,120
ensure that we comply with them and so

947
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:30,259
expect to hear more news on those things

948
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:31,970
soon we have a number of RFPs that need

949
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,340
to be wrapped up basically contracts

950
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:36,500
that need to be done so J's on top of

951
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,620
that with legal counsel so we're pleased

952
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,960
that that will close out by end of year

953
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,790
and then finalize the 20 closure that

954
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,010
should occur over the next couple of

955
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:48,920
weeks so don't anticipate any issues

956
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:51,740
there and then as we shift focus to next

957
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,840
year we'll have a face-to-face meeting

958
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,959
in the first quarter and the focus of

959
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,850
that will be to extend the initial

960
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,010
strategic assessment that we did and

961
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,930
focus a little bit more on things like

962
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,480
fundraising and sponsorship and the

963
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:08,419
endowment and really sort of go back to

964
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,650
square one and say you know what's our

965
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,540
objective for each of these activities

966
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,220
and where do we want to go over the next

967
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,650
few years how do we want to resource

968
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,540
them so that we can say increase

969
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:20,180
fundraising responsive or what have you

970
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:23,210
so that's an important one and then

971
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,680
finally and we're almost all the way

972
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,930
through this but finalizing an

973
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,770
investment policy statement basically a

974
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:33,470
guide to how things like our reserve

975
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:35,480
funds and our endowment are invested to

976
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,339
manage those resources so nothing

977
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,930
magical there that

978
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:42,788
should be done fairly soon this is we're

979
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:44,919
happy during the question-and-answer

980
00:46:42,789 --> 00:46:46,539
time to take questions here this is a

981
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,579
quick snapshot and it's a night chart

982
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:50,049
I'm not going to go through everything

983
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,509
this is for us a bit of a transitional

984
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:54,219
year because we came in as a board and

985
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:55,960
the March timeframe with a budget that

986
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:59,019
was developed before we really had a

987
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:02,019
clear sense of costs and in a number of

988
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:04,390
cases we've had delays from when we

989
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:06,189
projected bringing resources on and so

990
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:09,160
that caused in some cases costs to be a

991
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:10,989
little bit lower in other cases you know

992
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,788
things ended up being a little bit more

993
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:15,039
expensive than we thought so all those

994
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:16,869
things meted out we think that our 2020

995
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,849
budget will be a little bit more

996
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:23,229
accurate in those respects because we've

997
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:25,690
got real working data to go from and of

998
00:47:23,229 --> 00:47:27,098
course lots of ways to contact us we're

999
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,319

1000

1020
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:57,930
Postell award thank you hello everyone

1021
00:48:54,750 --> 00:49:01,320
I'm Andrew Sullivan I'm the president

1022
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:04,710
and CEO of the Internet Society and we

1023
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:07,859
are the presenters of the Jonathan beep

1024
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:13,890
Estelle award this is a service award

1025
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:16,799
that was created to honor the memory of

1026
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:19,920
Jon Postel I didn't know Jon Postel but

1027
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,849
many of you did he is sometimes invoked

1028
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,250
as something of a saint or a patron of

1029
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:29,220
in various in various arguments I am

1030
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:32,390
told reliably that he was however a

1031
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:36,359
truly and deeply human person who

1032
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:39,480
consistently gave his all for the

1033
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:42,330
benefit of the Internet he was of course

1034
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,760
the first editor of the arm of the RFC

1035
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:47,339
series he authored and co-authored

1036
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,070
dozens of hundreds of RFC s

1037
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:52,619
first director of Vienna etc but I think

1038
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:55,080
most importantly he provided us with

1039
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,810
this tradition of working on behalf of

1040
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:01,890
the Internet I think that the Internet

1041
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:03,599
is a marvelously human technology it's

1042
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:06,420
something you know it's very easy to

1043
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,810
forget that we're really working here on

1044
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:12,150
behalf of humanity and it's something

1045
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:14,040
that I you know I kind of wake up every

1046
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,660
day and I can't believe that I get to

1047
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:18,119
participate in this along with so many

1048
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,830
other people and I think that that's the

1049
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:24,480
reason that the Postell award was

1050
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:26,509
established the Internet Society

1051
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,030
this award to honor people and

1052
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:32,910
organizations who like castel made these

1053
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:35,480
outstanding contributions in service to

1054
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:38,009
the data communications community and

1055
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,109
there is surprised there is a crystal

1056
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:42,690
trophy that is right here and there is

1057
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:44,750
also a US dollar twenty thousand dollar

1058
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:47,310
prize

1059
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:50,820
there are many awardees many of these

1060
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:52,460
are people that that we all know and of

1061
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:55,260
course they have contributed

1062
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:58,080
consistently to the development of the

1063
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,960
internet and I think that that this long

1064
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:04,619
tradition allows us to reflect on how it

1065
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,420
is that that we get the Internet we get

1066
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:09,300
it as a collaborative effort something

1067
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:11,910
that we do together the fact that we do

1068
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,790
this thing together means that humans

1069
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:17,069
have to contribute to one another and as

1070
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:21,810
a collective effort in order to in order

1071
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:23,280
to do that this year's awardee is I

1072
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,980
think

1073
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,070
[Applause]

[Music]

1075
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:43,649
many of you know na as as we can tell

1076
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:45,390
and he has been a contributor to the

1077
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,609
internet community for many many years

1078
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:50,609
he is one of the people who brought IP

1079
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:52,920
to Africa in the first place he is one

1080
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:55,920
of the people who helped in the creation

1081
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,980
of AfriNIC and continues to this very

1082

1083
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:04,800
networks contributing to the development

1084
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,910
of this you know for everyone and I

1085
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,830
think that that is one of the most

1086
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,480
beautiful things so I want to thank him

1087
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,270
and invite him forward to say a few

1088
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:14,150
words

1089
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:18,130

1093

1094
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:11,559
is Elena but some simply call me Elaine

1095
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,809
hi Ana

1096
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:17,930
so he works explicitly in this community

1097
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:24,680
so many people has issues spending my

1098
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:28,038
last name I say IANA so wack so I come

1099
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:30,529
from Africa and I'm someone who had

1100
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:35,109
opportunity to put his fingers in

1101
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:38,299
bulletin board system you GCPs tcp/ip as

1102
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:42,259
Andrew Jose said establishing the first

1103
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:46,910
connectivity in Togo Liberia's Guinea

1104
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:49,339
Conakry etc etcetera I've been involved

1105
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:55,220
also in building the ecosystem in Africa

1106
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:57,880
and these days I'm devoting my time

1107
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:02,209
building research and education network

1108
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:05,000
because this ecosystem the terrain

1109
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:08,510
ecosystem is lagging behind and not

1110
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:12,049
playing role we already expect from them

1111
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:15,880
in term of bringing engineers creating a

1112
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:19,930
new space for community engagement etc

1113
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:24,200
but what brought me here today I believe

1114
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:29,180
is model impact of my journeys and

1115
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:32,899
eternal itself I rested the technologies

1116
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:37,848
in mid nineteen were courage and

1117
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:42,380
determination when needed to build the

1118
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:48,829
knowledge to convince people to let you

1119
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:52,970
demonstrate and do what you think needed

1120
00:54:48,829 --> 00:54:56,260
for people to move a bit and to connect

1121
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:56,259
and talk to each other

1122
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:10,420
it was also important to really push

1123
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:14,680
fight go species talk to government talk

1124
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:17,380
to civil society that Africa cannot stay

1125
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,020
away from what was going on at a time

1126
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:23,020
you all know Africa how government how

1127
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:26,110
this is a very important and for them

1128
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:30,610
internet was a no-go we have to do that

1129
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:33,160
at that time dedications and staff net

1130
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:36,130
commitment the sense of services and

1131
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:39,850
pragmatics where resources which empower

1132
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:42,790
and exerted me reading all these

1133
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:47,380
experience they are still driving me

1134
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:51,520
today these qualities and attitude come

1135
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:55,350
to mind when we think of dr. John Jon

1136
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:58,090
Postel the long walk to technologies and

1137
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:01,900
quarter difficulties and issues as

1138
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:07,780
expected but we seem programmed to never

1139
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:10,690
give up we contributed to history had

1140
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:14,790
been the foundation by continuously

1141
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:20,220
enabling and empowering many African

1142
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:23,890
fellows and beyond all along

1143
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:29,589
we share our patience spread the virus

1144
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:34,420
we activated by embarking orders and we

1145
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:38,020
continue to inspire many more today many

1146
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:41,110
thanks to those who a part of these

1147
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:43,550
journeys I see some in this room thank

1148
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:47,879

[Applause]

1151
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:12,839
I do ask for permission to conclude by

1152
00:57:08,619 --> 00:57:15,729
giving a special thank to someone who

1153
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:18,308
many of us know very well professor Nick

1154
00:57:15,729 --> 00:57:19,558
we know who made the long trek to be

1155
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:24,819
here tonight

1156
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:28,509
thanks prof four tirelessly monitoring

1157
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:31,709
the flame in me always moving the target

1158
00:57:28,509 --> 00:57:35,410
and renewing because and for

1159
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:37,749
continuously reminders about the

1160
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:41,229
unfinished and their own started

1161
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:43,529
businesses of Internet on the continent

1162
00:57:41,229 --> 00:57:54,049
thank you

1163
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:54,050
[Applause]

1164
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:15,099
okay ask Bob if you can come on up so on

1165
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:17,230
sadly we lost a few people from our

1166
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:20,500
community since the last IETF meeting

1167
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:43,359
and Bob here is gonna come up and

1168
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:45,369
recognize Sally Floyd first Sally was

1169
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:49,630
someone who may not have wanted me to be

1170
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:54,880
the person that said this we had our

1171
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:58,000
run-ins but I wanted to give tribute to

1172
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,460
her for how much I learned from her and

1173
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:06,520
how much everyone else learned from her

1174
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:09,550
and not just from her research but from

1175
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:15,400
the way she conducted her research and

1176
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:21,820
the way she she explained that research

1177
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:26,430
as well her explanation style is what I

1178
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:28,780
remember most but for those of you that

1179
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:30,730
don't know who Sally was because she's

1180
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:35,920
not been around for some time now she

1181
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:37,540
retired in 2009 she was someone who

1182
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:45,390
knitted together the research community

1183
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:48,759
and the IETF and the IAB she retired

1184
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:56,500
2007 to two years sorry she retired from

1185
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:59,170
active life here 2007 and if any of you

1186
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:02,510
heard of red random early detection

1187
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:07,880
algorithm there was there was

1188
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:09,710
and Van Jackson I've tried to find out

1189
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:14,090
which it was more of but they were

1190
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:16,190
working together and that along with

1191
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:19,280
many many of our other research papers

1192
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:24,470
but at the point two years before she

1193
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:27,520
retired in the top ten cited researchers

1194
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:30,109
in the whole of computer science so you

1195
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:36,230
know that's that's quite something it's

1196
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:39,320
not just in networking she introduced

1197
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:42,140
the network simulator and s-two she was

1198
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,520
one of the lead lead on that and helped

1199
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:49,400
also to bring in and it's three

1200
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:54,920
afterwards and she also was the author

1201
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:57,080
on many many rfcs here she I mean you

1202
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:01,580
think you can go and look at her list

1203
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:06,740
but if I pick out I guess

1204
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:10,220
she's most known for her crusade for

1205
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:14,299
careful congestion control and she wrote

1206
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:22,549
many RFC's on that she was on the IAB

1207
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:23,930
and wrote a number of policy RFC's work

1208
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:28,340
on an EC any explicit congestion

1209
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:35,740
notification and mostly I guess was all

1210
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:39,440
her work on TCP all the the parts of TCP

1211
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:46,120
that were brought in over the years to

1212
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:49,790
improve it a lot of that was Sally so

1213
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:53,900
but as I said it was her explanations

1214
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:55,550
that I remember most she sort of put

1215
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:57,980
aside time the own see on a sofa with

1216
01:01:55,550 --> 01:02:03,680
you and explain how you needed to think

1217
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:06,230
about something and how to understand

1218
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,819
something more deeply and I should come

1219
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:13,760
to the mic in a conference and she did

1220
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:15,500
always explain to the audience the whole

1221
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,000
background before she gave the comment

1222
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,130
about

1223
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,710
and she never assumed that everyone knew

1224
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:27,430
everything so I particularly wanted to

1225
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:32,410
just say that I think the Internet's a

1226
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:33,848
lot safer because of Sally and you have

1227
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:37,089
to think what would have happened

1228
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:40,599
without her everything she did about

1229
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:44,349
congestion control particularly if she

1230
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:47,320
had not done that we might not have

1231
01:02:44,349 --> 01:02:50,770
heard the Internet we've gone now

1232
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:53,349
and just that ramming home continually

1233
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:54,910
how important it was even though it's

1234
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:57,190
something that had never you know after

1235
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:59,379
the congestion collapses in the 80s it

1236
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:01,450
is something that never happened you

1237
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:06,070
have to keep remembering what never

1238
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:09,149
happened so it doesn't happen and and

1239
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:15,570
the other point someone made to me was

1240
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:20,170
also all the people who she explained to

1241
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:23,440
she would put so much time into that you

1242
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:25,839
think if those people had not have

1243
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,980
listened to her how many dangerous

1244
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,810
things would have happened on the

1245
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:30,400
Internet

1246
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:36,880
because of all the stupid research that

1247
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:38,619
she stopped okay and so that is why the

1248
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,810
Internet's a safer place without Sally

1249
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:43,570
and this chap here has got to come on

1250
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:44,980
next his comment when I asked him what

1251
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:48,089
he would say in one sentence about her

1252
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:48,089
he said she walks on water

1253
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:54,120
[Music]

1254
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:04,940
well so I'm actually I'm gonna back up a

1255
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:06,770
little bit I have been to many CCNA

1256
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:09,520
classes and that kind of thing during my

1257
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:11,720
time at Cisco and educational

1258
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,150
environments throughout the world and

1259
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:17,359
everywhere that I would go I would have

1260
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:21,230
the teacher the professor come to me and

1261
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:24,920
say would you spend the lunch break with

1262
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:30,380
the women in my class because they think

1263
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:33,800
there is no place for women in IT and I

1264
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:36,079
would I actually had talked that I would

1265
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:38,180
show them and I would say let me

1266
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:41,290
introduce you to a few of my friends and

1267
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:46,940
Sally was an important one in that talk

1268
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:49,880
just the expertise and the persona and

1269
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:56,150
all that she brought to the party was

1270
01:04:49,880 --> 01:05:01,160
very important oh I have to actually use

1271
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:02,559
the mic okay so now let me talk about

1272
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:08,779
one more

1273
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:11,930
Keith McLaury the the SNMP protocol was

1274
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:14,450
the outcome of the doctoral research

1275
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:19,190
done by Marshall Rose brought to the

1276
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:25,308
IETF with four major architects behind

1277
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:29,240
it Marshall and Geoff case and Steve

1278
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:31,880
ballbuster and Keith now the I went

1279
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:34,459
around and I spoke with or I emailed

1280
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:38,180
with various people who knew Keith and

1281
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:41,089
knew his contributions and asked them

1282
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:43,399
for comments and if there was one thing

1283
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:45,680
that I heard from every single one of

1284
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:49,160
them is that he was a gentleman

1285
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:51,919
and a very good engineer so I included

1286
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:56,118
those comments on on these slides here

1287
01:05:51,920 --> 01:06:00,799
Andy Biermann I note is on the deme deco

1288
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:03,740
tonight so Andy's comment and one that I

1289
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:05,750
heard from many was that he was

1290
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:08,058
completely trusted by the community if

1291
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:09,990
they had made comments on a document in

1292
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:12,300
something needed to happen

1293
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:13,580
it if Keith understood didn't and he

1294
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,930
always did

1295
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:17,730
once Kees understood them the right

1296
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:20,399
thing would happen and he was trusted

1297
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:22,200
with which is an important thing Keith

1298
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:39,060
made a huge contribution in this

1299
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:40,980
community Sten rather who was the man a

1300
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:45,270
working group chair that's the way on

1301
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:47,490
October 22nd of this year I started

1302
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:50,850
working with Stan probably around 20

1303
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:52,529
years ago we his team and I started

1304
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:55,049
working on something that was called

1305
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:57,840
ad-hoc Network at the time I didn't know

1306
01:06:55,050 --> 01:07:00,150
what it was so we had the pleasure of

1307
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:02,910
having him explained to us and

1308
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:06,900
introduced all of us to that world of

1309
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:10,618
for structureless completely distributed

1310
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:12,090
networking at the beginning of our

1311
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:15,270
collaboration we didn't know each other

1312
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:18,650
very well but we quickly the whole team

1313
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:22,170
got to know him that's know his humor

1314
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:24,420
self-deprecating sarcastic and sometimes

1315
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:31,140
even politically correct

1316
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:36,150
he was a engineer that always put his

1317
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:38,009
abilities down he didn't want to be the

1318
01:07:36,150 --> 01:07:41,280
center of attention but it was clear

1319
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:43,770
from the beginning that he would be what

1320
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,340
he became he became pillar of the

1321
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:49,170
community he will be missed by a whole

1322
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:51,750
industry he made very important

1323
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:55,080
contributions some of them Allah and

1324
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:57,150
he's also a quarter of a OD version - he

1325
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:00,270
was a chair of the many working group

1326
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:01,680
for many many years during probably the

1327
01:08:00,270 --> 01:08:03,780
most productive time of the working

1328
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:07,980
group but also the most contentious time

1329
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:10,170
in the working he was always there to

1330
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:12,060
provide his technical opinion to bring

1331
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:16,490
the working room forward to get it to

1332
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:19,460
consensus to try to move it along and

1333
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:21,559
have fruitful discussions all the time

1334
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,469
or last couple of years the working

1335
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:26,480
group has been slowing down so maybe for

1336
01:08:24,469 --> 01:08:30,799
the last four or five months he was the

1337
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:35,358
only chair in the money where we last

1338
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:36,170
had a conversation on October 21st okay

1339
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:41,509
before he died

1340
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:43,699
and you talked about the meeting the

1341
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:46,939
working group and what we were planning

1342
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:49,488
to do here so today we actually had the

1343
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:52,040
meeting a meeting before right before

1344
01:08:49,488 --> 01:08:53,839
the plenary and we did probably what

1345
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,089
Stan would have wanted to do many times

1346
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:58,850
especially during the contentious times

1347
01:08:56,089 --> 01:09:00,710
was working we had a short meeting went

1348
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:03,580
through document updates and then we

1349
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:08,120
went to the bar we had a same red live

1350
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:11,330
tribute barb off-site meeting at an

1351
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:12,880
actual bar it was great which well

1352
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:16,729
stories about Stan

1353
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:19,640
self-deprecating sarcastic and some

1354
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:22,189
actually politically correct we drank

1355
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:25,190
beer beer that Stan would actually

1356
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:29,080
choose from a town in Germany called

1357
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:32,870
fuking after very care policy that work

1358
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:35,540
it's a hell you can put two hundred

1359
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:39,649
together which in German I think it

1360
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:41,390
means like a pale his closest friends

1361
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:44,830
from the working group in the ATF were

1362
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:47,690
there we will all miss him

1363
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:50,540
her stories of a these closing working

1364
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:53,988
groups while they're standing up here on

1365
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:59,330
the stage most of them before they leave

1366
01:09:53,988 --> 01:10:00,650
the Aug I have my iPad here I'm not

1367
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:03,769
gonna close the working group don't

1368
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:05,780
worry but I still haven't gotten the

1369
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:08,500
courage to take Stan off the list of

1370
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:08,500
chairs

1371
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:16,639
so that's ones there we go we're going

1372
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:19,780
to stand in the ATF in the industry you

1373
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,780
also good friend thank you

1374
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:34,410
thank you let's have a moment of silence

1375
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:34,410
to remember these three individuals

1376
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:58,049
thank you and thank you

1377
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:59,550
Robin Fred oh he's already here

1378
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:17,100
great so we're gonna move on to the

1379
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:19,740
recognition portion of the plenary hi

1380
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,510
I'm Adrian Farrell and currently I'm

1381
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:27,120
serving as an independent submissions

1382
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:31,620
editor and it's my task conceived noon

1383
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:33,390
to to thank Heather so Heather can we

1384
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:41,640
have you up here so that we can

1385
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:48,240
embarrass you publicly I was going to do

1386
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:51,750
some history of of the the RSC series

1387
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:54,300
editor and and so on but I went for a

1388
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:56,970
reference to a draft that Heather had

1389
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:59,790
written and frankly you might as well

1390
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:04,080
read her draft because I went nearly as

1391
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:06,900
good job some observations about Heather

1392
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:09,390
then largely speaking on in awe of

1393
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:17,879
Heather and this is not simply because

1394
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:19,350
my wife is a an editor I have a long

1395
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:21,710
long list of things to say about you

1396
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,710
don't worry

1397
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:27,120
Heather is I think unflappable at least

1398
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:30,240
she appears to be she sort of drifts

1399
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,400
around serenely like a swan and maybe

1400
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:36,990
underneath her legs are flapping but we

1401
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:39,599
we really don't notice that and I think

1402
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:41,880
she sort of parachuted into a very very

1403
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,920
strange environment where we're an odd

1404
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:46,830
set of people I I wouldn't say that

1405
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:50,580
we're easy to get on with in a work

1406
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:55,440
sense and it's not an easy environment

1407
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:57,990
to enter but Heather seemed to just drop

1408
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:59,830
in and was immediately working and being

1409
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:02,990
effective

1410
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:06,550
in particular she inherited two issues

1411
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:10,849
that have been hanging over us for

1412
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:13,580
absolutely forever the the fact that we

1413
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:17,080
publish our documents in ASCII and we

1414
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:21,230
really ought to go a bit beyond that and

1415
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:24,769
that our publication format was maybe a

1416
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:27,200
little rusty and old and those seem like

1417
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:29,450
insurmountable problems they've been

1418
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:32,300
there forever but Heather just got on

1419
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:36,550
with it and as you saw from her slides

1420
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:36,550
earlier progress has been made

1421
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:41,120
Heather is always polite at least she's

1422
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:43,000
always polite to me and she always

1423
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:46,280
appears to be polite to everybody else

1424
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,770
she's charming and totally and

1425
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:51,620
absolutely professional and every time I

1426
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:55,430
see her in a difficult situation dealing

1427
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:59,380
with it I'm just blown away by how she

1428
01:13:55,430 --> 01:14:03,340
manages to remain calm and professional

1429
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:06,650
she's been a great asset to us and I

1430
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:10,790
find it hard to imagine the ITF without

1431
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:13,040
her but although she will be missed we

1432
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:20,260
thank her and hope she will do well in

1433
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:20,260
her new work and I think we need it

1434
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:27,440
it's from Alyssa but anyway

1435
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:27,940
[Laughter]

1436
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,110

thank you it's been a character-building

1440
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:11,270
experience thank you and we're on to the

1441
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:14,350
IAB open microphone session so the IAB

01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:03,900
question I really just wanted to stand

1451
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:06,240
at the microphone one last time and say

1452
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,210
thank you - Heather Flanagan

an absolute dream I couldn't have asked

1455
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:18,900
for better I think what you've given to

1456
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:21,090
the ietf since I didn't have any of that

1457

past history I mean no disrespect to

1458
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:24,480
everybody who came before you but if for

1459
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:26,700
anybody who comes after you they have

1460
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:30,740
extremely large shoes to fill

1461
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:36,540

1462

1473
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:29,750
rewarding experience to be on the NomCom

1474
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:31,880
so far throughout my professional work I

1475
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:34,340
am mostly limited to the internet

1476
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:36,140
routing side of things and in

1477
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:39,260
interviewing the many candidates that

1478
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:41,510
have made themselves available to be

1479
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:44,480
considered candidates for various

1480
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:47,600
different boards I've had a phenomenal

1481
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:52,339
insight into how the ITF works what I a

1482
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:55,030
bee does how I achieve works very very

1483
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:58,610
insightful and cool and in the current

1484
01:18:55,030 --> 01:19:00,320
set of nominees there there it was a

1485
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:05,740
fantastic set of candidates available

1486
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:09,740
for aib positions if I look at i AST

1487
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:13,250
nominees for some of the positions it's

1488
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:15,830
it's fairly challenging to make good

1489
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:19,190
choices when there is a lack of choices

1490
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:21,620
and actually maybe I should now move to

1491
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:24,110
this community because the reason we

1492
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:29,559
have a lack of choices is that there has

1493
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:32,900
been a lack of nominations by you and me

1494
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:35,240
so what is it we can do to encourage

1495
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:40,089
more participation in the leadership

1496
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:45,080
roles for the functions that need to be

1497
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:46,670
appointed to two people and also part of

1498
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,950
that process is that people leave

1499
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:50,750
feedback and I've observed that many

1500
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:53,450
many people have provided feedback

1501
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:56,330
through online tool or conversations and

1502
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:58,519
always or coming to the NomCom office

1503
01:19:56,330 --> 01:20:03,050
that is great I'm very happy with that

1504
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:04,850
but I want us to think in the next 12

1505
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:08,410
months how next year we

1506
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:11,570
can make sure that there is not only

1507
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:12,980
that there is actually more choice so we

1508
01:20:11,570 --> 01:20:15,320
can make sure that we make the best

1509
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:17,419
possible choices thank you for your

1510
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:19,780
consideration thank you for your

1511
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,780
comments

1512
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:31,849
Phil Han Baker a situation arise in a

1513
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:34,570
different standards organization that

1514
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:39,560
has caused me some concern as to

1515
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:42,080
practice in ITF in particular I noticed

1516
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:49,280
that note well has no mention of

1517
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:52,330
antitrust and there are two reasons here

1518
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:56,450
one is the protection of the

1519
01:20:52,330 --> 01:21:02,420
organization if things pan out as I

1520
01:20:56,450 --> 01:21:04,220
expect them to do in that case which at

1521
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:08,080
this point I expect to become a federal

1522
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:12,170
case there will be fingers being pointed

1523
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:15,440
and it will become very serious and I

1524
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:19,630
think that it it behooves us to at least

1525
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:21,730
warn people that even if you're not

1526
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:25,070
officially speaking for your

1527
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:30,049
organization if you get up to a

1528
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:35,380
microphone and you say if your company

1529
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:39,640
offers this service to various people

1530
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:46,190
then we will destroy your business oh

1531
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:49,910
yes oh yes then that is not only putting

1532
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:55,900
your employer risk it is putting you at

1533
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:59,389
risk and I don't want to get into the

1534
01:21:55,900 --> 01:22:02,110
details of that situation but I think

1535
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:04,370
that we need to take this seriously

1536
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:05,960
first let me say I'm relieved that this

1537
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:07,660
is all happening in a different SDO

1538
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:10,220
that's very good news indeed

1539
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:12,590
second I'd like to just point out that

1540
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:15,020
the the note well and the documents

1541
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:17,000
which it refers to are all actually

1542
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,770
published on the IETF stream and

1543
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:27,650
therefore it's really the IEEE ASG

1544
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:29,120
should take note of your comments the

1545
01:22:27,650 --> 01:22:30,620
mic lines are open

1546
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:35,990
is there anybody else with the comments

1547
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:49,519
or a question for the IV thank you very

1548
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:51,670
much we'll move on the LLC board come on

1549
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,670
up

1550
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:31,310
all right we're happy to take questions

1551
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:36,000
by st. John's just one quick question

1552
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:39,270
since we put in the new fair new rate

1553
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,300
structure how many of the early

1554
01:23:39,270 --> 01:23:44,340
registrations represent people who

1555
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:46,580
didn't actually end up showing up do you

1556
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:50,360
have any idea what those numbers are I

1557
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:53,670
mean how much money did we take in just

1558
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:55,830
gratis that's a that's an excellent

1559
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:58,640
question that I don't think we know the

1560
01:23:55,830 --> 01:24:01,740
immediate answer to so let us take a

1561
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:05,310
item to go investigate that Thanks thank

1562
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:10,800
you thank you yes yeah Brian carpenter

1563
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:13,170
um thanks for the the report earlier I'm

1564
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:17,790
not trying to be provocative but as you

1565
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:21,630
know the the previous thing we had the

1566
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:24,390
AOC dug its own grave by getting far too

1567
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:26,160
deep into micromanagement so I'd like to

1568
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:28,470
know now that you have a permanent

1569
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:31,349
executive director in place what the

1570
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:33,030
board is going to do to make sure he

1571
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:37,860
does the management and you do the

1572
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:39,540
strategy well I think that's are one of

1573
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:42,179
our key jobs is to make sure that that's

1574
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:44,730
the case and you know we've said that

1575
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:47,760
those expectations with Jay from the

1576
01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:50,519
start and I think it's going to be a

1577
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:54,800
regular topic of conversation to ensure

1578
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:57,840
that we are doing so you know I think

1579
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:01,620
certainly habits have to be set you know

1580
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:04,370
with the new executive director yeah

1581
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:06,750
Adam a bit of color on that Jay started

1582
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:08,610
four weeks ago and for the last three

1583
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:11,730
weeks I have consistently found myself

1584
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:15,070
saying please go ask Jay which has been

1585
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:23,530
delightful so hoping

1586
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:26,380
as we go forward Siobhan's ahead so I

1587
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:29,440
learned this ITF meeting that the one

1588
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:31,390
day guest pass program that allowed

1589
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:34,719
local researchers and academics to

1590
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:38,860
attend the IETF for free for one day the

1591
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:41,110
program was discontinued and and as a

1592
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:43,450
co-chair of a research group we rely we

1593
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:44,920
have relied on this program to get local

1594
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:48,730
researchers to come and give

1595
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:50,710
presentations so I understand some of

1596
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:53,530
the reasons behind why that was why this

1597
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:56,650
was done just wondering why it was not

1598
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:59,590
announced and also wondering like if

1599
01:25:56,650 --> 01:26:02,290
there is a plan for like having

1600
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:04,060
something similar because it is I feel

1601
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,830
like it is a goal of the ITF you know

1602
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:08,410
one of the goals we go to the reasons

1603
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:09,940
why we go to different venues is so that

1604
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:12,519
we can engage with the local community

1605
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:13,690
and I think you know professors and

1606
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,810
students are an important part of that

1607
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:20,099
so just wondering if there is a plan to

1608
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:24,730
either have something like it or

1609
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:28,690
reinstate it thank you for your question

1610
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:30,790
so it's true that we had to put the

1611
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:33,339
guest Day program on pause we were

1612
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:35,050
having some difficulty with people who

1613
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:36,640
were abusing the program for the

1614
01:26:35,050 --> 01:26:38,470
purposes of being able to travel to a

1615
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:40,420
particular country and then they weren't

1616
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:42,220
actually local people they were just

1617
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:44,910
using it to get into the country and

1618
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:48,580
then not showing up at the IETF meeting

1619
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:53,080
so we had to make a decision on short

1620
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:55,059
order about that but it's it's under

1621
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:58,510
consideration for what to do in the

1622
01:26:55,060 --> 01:27:00,490
future and you know we're hoping to find

1623
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:03,130
a way that we can accommodate something

1624
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:05,410
similar somehow but in the meantime we

1625
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:08,920
need to figure out how to not have it be

1626
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:10,630
abused in that way so it's it's not gone

1627
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:18,010
forever necessarily but we need to work

1628
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:21,640
out how to make it functional hi bob

1629
01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:25,180
Hindon so when Jay did the presentation

1630
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:26,900
earlier about future meetings it went by

1631
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:28,700
so quickly so may have this wrong

1632
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:31,339
but it looked like there was not a

1633
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:34,090
meeting in Asia year after next just

1634
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:38,420
died see that right

1635
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:42,440
or maybe it's still back here no the

1636
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:47,960
year after that we're switching the

1637
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:56,059
rotation so we're switching Asia from

1638
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:58,370
the November to the March slot so

1639
01:27:56,060 --> 01:28:02,170
basically a time of year shift for when

1640
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:05,150
the one one ones occur yeah so from from

1641
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:08,150
2022 onward we're hoping to have Asia

1642
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:10,849
and the in the March slot from 2021

1643
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:14,389
there will be no Asia meeting correct -

1644
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:15,890
in Europe one in the US right yeah we

1645
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:17,720
thought maybe there would have been like

1646
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:22,850
an email to the list about this or

1647
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:25,600
something okay yeah I mean because I

1648
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:29,960
thought we were gonna do Asia every year

1649
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:33,110
so the policy is to have roughly roughly

1650
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:35,540
equal allocations between the three

1651
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:37,160
regions but it also says that in any

1652
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:39,320
given year we might not make it to every

1653
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:41,660
region because of this kind of

1654
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:45,290
fluctuation so if you look at the

1655
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:48,320
meeting venue policy document that's

1656
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:51,170
that's what it expresses right but it

1657
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:54,259
will we catch up I'm sorry will we catch

1658
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:57,380
up that would be - weezing stage in one

1659
01:28:54,260 --> 01:29:01,100
year right I think the point is that

1660
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:03,010
over time we we aspire to hit each

1661
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:05,750
region roughly the same number of times

1662
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:09,860
so that's what we're attempting to do

1663
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:14,450
okay will you understand my comment yes

1664
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:19,150
I think we do it was sort of would have

1665
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:19,150
been nice if it was mentioned thank you

1666
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:25,610
hey Jason Elliot here I just wanted to

1667
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:30,740
thank the LLC for the opportunity to

1668
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:32,799
engage on the discussion about draft

1669
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:36,769
clear we gotta stop meeting like this

1670
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:38,710
which looks at investigating new modes

1671
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:43,060
for

1672
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:45,490
from eating it's that when we met I

1673
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:48,340
think I took two things from it the

1674
01:29:45,490 --> 01:29:50,320
first is that J is gonna take on board

1675
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:52,840
to figure out some questions to ask that

1676
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:57,519
might might help us in the community

1677
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:59,020
deliberate about how we might meet

1678
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,360
differently or how much resources we're

1679
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:04,260
using as we meet second thing I took

1680
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:06,580
from that so that people know is that I

1681
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:08,740
continue to engage with this community

1682
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:10,750
so that maybe the community can bring

1683
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:14,320
forward approaches that they want to try

1684
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:16,150
over time and so I just want again one I

1685
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,219
think thank you guys for not forgetting

1686
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:21,040
about that and obviously you have very

1687
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:22,690
important things to do like hire J and I

1688
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,490
look forward to working on this problem

1689
01:30:22,690 --> 01:30:26,080
so we understand our carbon footprint

1690
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:28,330
and understand how we can continue to

1691
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:31,150
work effectively maybe even by reducing

1692
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:33,120
our carbon footprint and I'll be talking

1693
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:40,929
more with everybody about this soon

1694
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:55,990
thank you okay great thank you very much

1695
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:58,270
appreciate it yeah you can come on up so

1696
01:30:55,990 --> 01:31:02,440
for the is G open mic we're running a

1697
01:30:58,270 --> 01:31:04,720
little experiment we're try to keep the

1698
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:08,259
questions and the answers short and

1699
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:10,450
focused so there's a timer right here

1700
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:13,510
we're gonna a lot two minutes per

1701
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:21,280
question and two minutes total for the

1702
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:23,680
answer from the stage we had signs we

1703
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:28,349
can see the timer but we have all kinds

1704
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:28,350
of analog mechanisms for keeping time

1705

I will I will attempt not to use my full

1721
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:58,940
two minutes I'm John Levine I have kind

1722
01:32:54,360 --> 01:33:01,679
of a meta question here I have noticed I

1723
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:06,210
am using the mic perhaps I can shout out

1724
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:09,110
do it more loudly okay well there's 15

1725
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:12,210
seconds out of the way my question is

1726
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:13,200
I'm seeing a lot more tribalism that I

1727
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:15,540
have in the past

1728
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,860
and particularly in some of the some of

1729
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:19,200
the some of the working groups I'm in

1730
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:21,809
it's it's very unfortunate that people

1731
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:23,610
seem to like you get people onto slate

1732
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:25,680
well the obvious places for example is

1733
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:27,269
dough I mean there are there are

1734
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:30,350
competing people who have very clear

1735
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:34,590
ideas of what the right answer is and

1736
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:36,600
and not a very not a very good I very

1737
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:39,270
not a very good handle on how long one

1738
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:42,180
reaches consensus about this and as I've

1739
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:44,280
mentioned a few times before I know a

1740
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:46,170
lot of Quakers who have a process that

1741
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:49,050
everybody everybody with them describes

1742
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:51,150
it as as consensus and a key part of it

1743
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:53,700
is what they call standing aside which

1744
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:55,740
is saying you know you get kind of as

1745
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:59,010
close to it as close to it as an answer

1746
01:33:55,740 --> 01:34:00,540
you get as you can and then use omit but

1747
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:02,760
it is important that you be able to say

1748
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:04,800
I am not thrilled with this answer but I

1749
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:06,540
don't hate it so much that I'm that I'm

1750
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,950
gonna kill it you know and this is

1751
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:09,660
different from rough consensus whatever

1752
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:12,510
rough consensus is basically somebody

1753
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:14,940
says we're close enough and the people

1754
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:18,600
who hate it too bad here we ask people

1755
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:19,799
specifically to say you know I am in the

1756
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:23,490
interests in the interest of the entire

1757
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:24,810
group you know I'm standing back because

1758
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:27,630
it's more important the thing goes ahead

1759
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:28,800
and I'm wondering you know have the rest

1760
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:30,930
of you noticed this and I'm Chris Oh

1761
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,390
many of you have and if so is you know

1762
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:34,950
is there something is there any way we

1763
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:37,250
can kind of work on our process to try

1764
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:39,929
to make it more consensus II and perhaps

1765
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:41,520
more productive in dealing with the very

1766
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:49,760
contentious topics that we are running

1767
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:49,760
into thank you very do you wanna answer

1768
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:55,390
I think we have to rely on the working

1769
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,160
group chairs to lead this and Pete

1770
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:59,170
Resnick has been having conversations

1771
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:01,150
with the working group chairs for

1772
01:34:59,170 --> 01:35:05,620
instance today and the working group

1773
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:07,540
chairs lunch trying to help sort out how

1774
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:09,730
to call consensus and how to lead people

1775
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:11,980
into consensus and ELISA has been

1776
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:13,450
working on getting training for the

1777
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:20,139
working group chairs that we're going to

1778
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:21,360
be starting to set up soon so I guess

1779
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:23,820
that's my answer

1780
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:26,380
yeah instead of following on from that

1781
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:27,759
this sort of taking a step back or being

1782
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:29,200
willing to stand back and say it's more

1783
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:33,340
important than it goes ahead than that I

1784
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:36,250
get my way is something which needs to

1785
01:35:33,340 --> 01:35:38,260
be learnt over time if you have some

1786
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:39,760
recommendations or suggestions where you

1787
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,990
see that working that you can send that

1788
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,780
people can sort of learn from I think

1789
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:45,820
would be really helpful often though I

1790
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:48,309
see people have incredibly strong views

1791
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:50,410
and so having somebody be willing to

1792
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:52,090
actually say you know I'm willing to

1793
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:54,400
take a step back as tricky but you have

1794
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:56,580
to consent hints pointers that would be

1795
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,580
helpful

1796
01:35:57,030 --> 01:36:01,150
yeah I think to answer the first half of

1797
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:03,760
your question yes I think more of us

1798
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:06,429
have seen that and another thing that I

1799
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:08,680
would add is that some of the steps that

1800
01:36:06,430 --> 01:36:11,260
we're trying to take to help sort of

1801
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:12,970
improve the general conduct are related

1802
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:15,720
to things that we can do to get people

1803
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:18,880
to think about what are the actual

1804
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:21,970
screaming's and what is best for the

1805
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,860
intern as a whole and maybe felicitate a

1806
01:36:21,970 --> 01:36:30,280
facilitate that's sort of standing back

1807
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:32,339
that you described okay thank you thank

1808
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,340
you

1809
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:41,769
Wester Tucker is a and I'm here to

1810
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:43,600
answer John's question and I a number of

1811
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:46,150
you have heard this speech from me this

1812
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:49,570
week alone but the reality is is that we

1813
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:53,610
have a culture in this in the IGF where

1814
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:56,969
we desire to poke holes in somebody's

1815
01:36:53,610 --> 01:37:00,070
technical statements and technical plans

1816
01:36:56,970 --> 01:37:02,330
without really considering if there's

1817
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:04,519
any good parts you want to make use of

1818
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:06,890
and so rather than looking for the good

1819
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,470
parts we'll get a line of 20 people that

1820
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:11,240
want to you know poke a hole and often

1821
01:37:09,470 --> 01:37:15,620
the same hole that the person before

1822
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:18,500
them you know just just found it does

1823
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:20,900
start with the working group chairs it

1824
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,880
does start with the iesg members and to

1825
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:24,410
talk to the person that asks the

1826
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,500
question about what can we do to get

1827
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:30,019
more appointees to the IHG members we

1828
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:32,360
need a better environment where people

1829
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:34,160
are rewarded for actually helping and

1830
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:36,080
actually participating as opposed to

1831
01:37:34,160 --> 01:37:37,910
standing on two sides of offense and

1832
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:40,040
just refusing to even look over the

1833
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:44,360
fence to see the other side and whether

1834
01:37:40,040 --> 01:37:46,160
the grass is even there that that's

1835
01:37:44,360 --> 01:37:47,570
gonna take work not just from the ASG

1836
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,769
members not just from working for

1837
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:51,830
charities gonna take work from the whole

1838
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:52,490
community and and I encourage to go back

1839
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:54,200
to the NomCom

1840
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:56,990
person that was asking about you know

1841
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:59,150
how do we select who's going to be

1842
01:37:56,990 --> 01:38:01,269
pointed into a position we need to

1843
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:04,700
select a culture that's going to be

1844
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:06,530
positive and constructive and not just

1845
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:08,960
destructive it's important to point out

1846
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:11,210
weaknesses in a technical argument it's

1847
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:15,040
also important to fix those technical

1848
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:24,500
weaknesses rather than just point about

1849
01:38:15,040 --> 01:38:26,390
thank you two things I don't like the

1850
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:29,440
timer but that's not why I came up to

1851
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:32,720
talk about but I wanted to let you know

1852
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:36,500
so there was a disc recent discussion on

1853
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:38,780
the ITF lists about the role of area

1854
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:42,100
directors and how much work they have to

1855
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:44,809
do or didn't don't do or all of that and

1856
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:46,640
I thought that was interesting and you

1857
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:48,590
know as we here you can see from the

1858
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:52,400
NomCom report it's hard to fill your

1859
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:55,340
jobs so I'd like to hear from you guys

1860
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:58,280
and yeah you don't need to do it in

1861
01:38:55,340 --> 01:39:01,940
whatever the timer says but I'd like to

1862
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:04,550
get your feedback on you know how how we

1863
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:07,610
can make this not such an impossible job

1864
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:11,140
so we get a bigger pool of people to

1865
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:11,139
select thank you

1866
01:39:11,469 --> 01:39:17,659
so thank you for your question we had a

1867
01:39:15,139 --> 01:39:22,309
discussion of this in the is G day

1868
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:24,138
before yesterday and we felt that the

1869
01:39:22,309 --> 01:39:26,510
discussion list had gone in many

1870
01:39:24,139 --> 01:39:28,219
different directions and that as a first

1871
01:39:26,510 --> 01:39:31,159
step what we thought would be useful

1872
01:39:28,219 --> 01:39:34,389
would be to just draw up a list and sort

1873
01:39:31,159 --> 01:39:37,280
of categorize the various different

1874
01:39:34,389 --> 01:39:39,469
parts of the problem and directions that

1875
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:41,929
this conversation had gone in there's

1876
01:39:39,469 --> 01:39:44,959
also a lot of history here many eye

1877
01:39:41,929 --> 01:39:47,629
issues have discussed this problem then

1878
01:39:44,959 --> 01:39:50,119
faced with you know similar NomCom

1879
01:39:47,629 --> 01:39:52,550
statistics so we thought as a baseline

1880
01:39:50,119 --> 01:39:54,169
it might be useful to just outline what

1881
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:57,409
the set of issues are that have been

1882
01:39:54,169 --> 01:40:00,439
raised and try to structure our own

1883
01:39:57,409 --> 01:40:02,449
thinking and discussion that way instead

1884
01:40:00,439 --> 01:40:04,489
of you know that the mailing list

1885
01:40:02,449 --> 01:40:05,928
threads and another part of our

1886
01:40:04,489 --> 01:40:08,239
discussion was also around the

1887
01:40:05,929 --> 01:40:12,619
perception of how much time the ad roll

1888
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:13,820
takes and that although we disclosed

1889
01:40:12,619 --> 01:40:16,188
this and the job descriptions and

1890
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:18,469
whatnot that it still might not be clear

1891
01:40:16,189 --> 01:40:20,090
exactly what the range is of the amount

1892
01:40:18,469 --> 01:40:22,070
of time that various different ATS

1893
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:24,800
dedicate to the job and do so

1894
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:27,079
successfully so that's another item that

1895
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:29,689
or one of the items that we might we

1896
01:40:27,079 --> 01:40:31,808
could potentially try to clarify other

1897
01:40:29,689 --> 01:40:36,649
people want to share their thoughts

1898
01:40:31,809 --> 01:40:38,329
Suresh yeah thanks Bob so one of the

1899
01:40:36,649 --> 01:40:40,039
things we noticed was that a lot of the

1900
01:40:38,329 --> 01:40:41,539
things in there have been suggested and

1901
01:40:40,039 --> 01:40:43,039
tried before as well so that's kind of

1902
01:40:41,539 --> 01:40:45,919
why you want to like collect all those

1903
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:47,329
things and and talk about previous

1904
01:40:45,919 --> 01:40:49,820
experiences on some of these things

1905
01:40:47,329 --> 01:40:51,349
right like the directorate's like you

1906
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:52,699
know what worked what didn't work so we

1907
01:40:51,349 --> 01:40:55,099
want to take some time to come up with a

1908
01:40:52,699 --> 01:40:56,478
comprehensive answer over there on like

1909
01:40:55,099 --> 01:41:02,809
what you think about what's come up

1910
01:40:56,479 --> 01:41:05,209
there yeah and I would also add that the

1911
01:41:02,809 --> 01:41:07,070
amount of work that it takes to be an ad

1912
01:41:05,209 --> 01:41:09,349
is to a larger pan

1913
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:13,219
to a large extent dependent on what you

1914
01:41:09,349 --> 01:41:15,649
want to make it take I mean if you don't

1915
01:41:13,219 --> 01:41:17,749
feel a need to put in all of your time

1916
01:41:15,649 --> 01:41:20,149
it's definitely possible to do the job

1917
01:41:17,749 --> 01:41:22,230
in less time than some of us are putting

1918
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:24,140
ahead

1919
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:33,410
[Applause]

1920
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:33,410
any other questions all right thank you

1921
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:40,899
[Applause]

1922
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:04,310
yes letter e is over
