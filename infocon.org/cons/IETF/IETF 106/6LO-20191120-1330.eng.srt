20
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:17,168
also need the jabber scribe is there

21

pointers to important resources such as

25
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:43,800
the online agenda the Java room

26
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:46,799
the mene Tekel and data path this is the

27
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,680
usual note well it contains a number of

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,840
pointers to ITF policies on important

29
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,410
topics so please make sure that you have

30
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,410
read it

31
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,089
and this is the agenda proposed for

32
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,390
today

33
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:06,060
so the first slot is the usual chairs

34
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,630
introduction and report of the working

35
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,090
group document status after that the

36
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,370
second slot is dedicated to the

37
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,488
fragmentation related draft which will

38
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,040
be presented by Pascal here we would

39
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:23,250
like to propose change compared with the

40
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,110
agenda that was originally announced we

41
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,479
would like to actually transfer five

42
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,720
minutes from the chairs introduction to

43
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:34,260
the fragmentation slot so we would have

44
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,570
ten minutes for each part the

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:42,719
introduction and fragmentation is there

46
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:46,919
any objection against this okay thank

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:50,729
you so then the next presentation will

48
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:54,359
be the update of ipv6 mesh over ble

49
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:56,669
links after the shepard review the next

50
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,710
one will be the presentation of the date

51
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:01,469
of the sixth low applicability and use

52
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,440
cases document presented by jung-geun

53
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,289
home and after that we'll have the

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:14,010
presentation of the update of ipv6 over

55
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:16,349
PLC draft by Remy after that we have the

56
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,719
first presentation of a new draft which

57
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,700
is entitled ipv6 over controller area

58
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,599
network this will be a remote

59
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:26,000
presentation given by Alexander and

60
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,440
after that we have yet another

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,110
presentation of a first version of a

62
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,719
draft which is entitled comparison of

63
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,430
six low and chic which will be presented

64
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,080
by a low hon

65
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:42,840
finally we'll have a presentation of the

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,000
draft entitled a symmetric ipv6 for IOT

67
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:50,039
networks so this is an update after the

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,680
previous presentation that was held in

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,490
Montreal by the way you can notice that

70
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,050
the 2 last slots in the agenda

71
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,389
correspond to considering alternative

72
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,020
techniques for header compression for

73
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:06,960
example so we expect to have a nice

74
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:16,740
discussion on this topic is there any

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:20,520
comment on the agenda ok thank you

76
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,979
so now let's go through the report of

77
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,620
the working group documents status and

78
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:29,210
this will be presented in decreasing

79
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,400
order in terms of maturity as usual so

80
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,289
first of all we have the packet delivery

81
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,159
deadline time document which is in the

82
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:41,280
RFC editor queue that's because it is

83
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,080
awaiting the publication of the 60-ish

84
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,190
architecture document which will be

85
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:51,330
normative in this document and the next

86
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:54,860
one is ipv6 over NFC which is in AD

87
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:59,150
follow up I don't know if you want to

88
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:02,610
yes so as you may recall this draft was

89
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,388
evaluated by the ASG there were a few

90
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:08,520
discuss positions and the authors dated

91
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,090
the draft and actually replied to the

92
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,719
ASG members who had made comments and he

93
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,250
should discuss ballots however the

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,870
status of the document has not changed

95
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:24,720
since then in fact we have not received

96
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:27,720
feedback from the is G since Montreal so

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,530
perhaps H is there any hint on when we

98
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,240
might get feedback I'll take a shot at

99
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,239
like you know the first six months right

100
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,770
so back in the deadline time and we

101
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,020
found mathematical error in the deadline

102
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,969
time calculation it's been approved it's

103
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,289
in Dallas area thank you so there's

104
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,690
something I need to update the ID is

105
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,318
John there's some new text thanks a lot

106
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,899
for charlie

107
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,529
working on it like so we need to talk to

108
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:58,050
you about it a little bit and so the NSC

109
00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:00,149
that the biggest issue was the tone of

110
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,520
the document and that caused a lot of

111
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:04,770
the discusses it looked a lot like a

112
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,359
marketing document for the technology so

113
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,369
it's it's kind of being rewritten and

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,469
I'm like talking to the discussing it is

115
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:11,999
to get this geared but I don't have a

116
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:13,680
clear indication of the stuff that's

117
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:15,479
needed to change yourself like in the

118
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,279
specific exchanges but it's more about

119
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,188
the tone of the document in there okay

120
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,740
and the AP nd I finished my ID eval I

121
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,080
haven't written up III wanted to send it

122
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,209
before this week that's actually the

123
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,128
first thing on my queue right like so I

124
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:32,310
once I send it to like hopefully Pascal

125
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:34,979
can lock down run very quickly on the de

126
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:38,489
panne D draft to submit a day there are

127
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:43,349
some changes that are required AP Indy

128
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,509
oh no no not yet I haven't sent it

129
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,579
that's what I'm saying so so so so what

130
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:49,709
happened with this draft is like we were

131
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,540
in a I Triple E coordination meeting and

132
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,459
they said they wanted to look at it so I

133
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,519
was waiting on the ITP folks to get back

134
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:59,219
and they got back and said they didn't

135
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,380
care about it frankly right so that kind

136
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,600
of like took like a three-month detour

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,569
and through the coordination process and

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,029
so that's done so once that's out of my

139
00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:12,920
way I'll get other documents done which

140
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:15,630
are pretty simple compared to AP nd

141
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:22,649
that's for my side so that's covers the

142
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:25,709
first six documents thank you so then

143
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:29,880
there's the next three documents which

144
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:32,910
have been recently entered the the a

145
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:38,279
devaluation state so the first thing is

146
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:40,170
6lowpan fragment forwarding which from

147
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,120
falling and from in recovery so the the

148
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,430
first two are the ones related with

149
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,350
fragmentation the first one six low

150
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,300
confirm and forwarding has been already

151
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,800
evaluated by the internet area

152
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,620
directorate actually dave taylor

153
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,508
provided review has engaged in

154
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,269
discussion with the author so thank you

155
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:58,649
very much Dave for this then the next

156
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,230
one is the fractional recovery draft

157
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:02,060
which is expected to be reviewed by the

158
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,020
Internet

159
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:10,160
directed by end of this month and the

160
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,250
backbone router document was since after

161
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,319
Montreal was reviewed by six man and

162
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,690
after that the author's updated the

163
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:22,240
document and well recently

164
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:25,790
it entered also the ad evolution state

165
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:30,770
so after that we have also the ipv6 mesh

166
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:33,079
of links document here the Shepherd has

167
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,800
done the review of the document the

168
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,590
authors have updated the draft and

169
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,569
provided that these update satisfies the

170
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,460
comments of the Shepherd then the next

171
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,250
step would be getting the Shepherd right

172
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,740
up then we also have the six low

173
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,720
applicability in use cases document as

174
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,550
you may recall there was a one key

175
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,470
working group last call which ended

176
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,680
without feedback for this document few

177
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,630
months ago however recently there has

178
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,239
been some feedback on the mailing list

179
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,730
for example Pascal provided reviewed the

180
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,840
document so thank you very much for that

181
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,370
and also after the deadline the internet

182
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,350
draft submission deadline there was also

183
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,230
some further feedback on the mailing

184
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:18,800
list by Remy so today there will be a

185
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:22,160
presentation of the latest revision of

186
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,979
this document and the last working group

187
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,670
document which is the ipv6 over PLC

188
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:32,690
draft has also been updated recently so

189
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:39,349
they it will also be presented today any

190
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:40,430
comments or questions I'm glad there's

191
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,020
like some feedback on the use case

192
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,120
document because I was really and

193
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,710
worried that it's just gonna die because

194
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,260
they're like it didn't look like anybody

195
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,990
was interested in it so I'm glad it's

196
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,370
like making some progress I still don't

197
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,890
know is there's like enough critical

198
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,150
mass behind it to take it through but

199
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,319
I'm at least glad that's something

200
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,319
something is happening in the space

201
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,319
[Music]

202
00:12:08,859 --> 00:12:15,999
yes so the next presentation is

203
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:15,998
fragmentation given by Pascal

204
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,780
okay so I was not sure initially that I

205
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,969
would need this slot and then things

206
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,890
happened so that's why I asked the

207
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,120
chairs and I thank you so much that to

208
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,380
make a little bit of room for the

209
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,540
discussion so we have two fragmentation

210
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,870
document what is the minimal fragment

211
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,750
which is a very generic specification

212
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,750
does not give implementation details but

213
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:02,140
global implementation recommendation or

214
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:06,430
constraints or overview and the other

215
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:11,860
one is fragment recovery and the minimal

216
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:14,170
fragment also discuss is a particular

217
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,510
implementation or describe set of points

218
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,880
to it the particular implementation is

219
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,420
DL week six lip injection reassembly

220
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,800
buffer thing so then there is a full

221
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,810
section one of the biggest section on

222
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:31,180
documents actually to describe that so

223
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:34,510
both past welcome plus Co as Calais

224
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,410
mentioned and so I'm just giving you the

225
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,480
the AB data of the Hawaii after death so

226
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:43,540
the the thing that really happened is

227
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,960
that we thank you Dave thanks so much we

228
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,730
had a number of from trips between me

229
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,190
and Dave actually so I kind of took over

230
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,920
because table was not a variable it was

231
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,440
the initial editor and that actually is

232
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,469
also part of that discussion that we had

233
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,930
is maybe Tom and I were not 100% in sync

234
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,340
about the content of this document so

235
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:07,030
that's why it's worth coming back to the

236
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,370
working group because we initially the

237
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,810
document did not really have an

238
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,390
introduction to explain what it was

239
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:16,660
about so that was the first reason why

240
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:20,410
we had this discrepancy and second the

241
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:25,930
most of the text was here is how VOB

242
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:30,040
works from from from up there and what

243
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:33,550
he did not do enough to my taste at

244
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,400
least was to say eh yeah

245
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,620
here is what any fragmentation falling

246
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,230
should be doing and that includes

247
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,640
being the Datagram tag and our reasons

248
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,520
for that and that should be explained

249
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,199
somewhere and also some things we

250
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,090
discovered when we started implementing

251
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,460
those drafts and particularly we can

252
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,220
sing how for all the I don't know if

253
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,260
Holies with us it's not but but he

254
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,850
published number of result of him of

255
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,250
implementation measurements and and

256
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:04,330
that's really clarified the pros and

257
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:07,750
cons of using this technology and how it

258
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,070
can be misused to the point that falling

259
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:14,230
fragment is actually worse than

260
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:16,480
recomposing at every hop so the feeling

261
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,320
I had you know on trying to answer

262
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,610
Dave's point well that this should be

263
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,060
described in more detail there's a need

264
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,370
to to tell the world that ok the ATF has

265
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,770
looked at what it is to fault fragment

266
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,300
there is one particular way which is

267
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,050
described in details down to the

268
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,839
implementation which is VRB that's great

269
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:42,150
we are being able to do it with RFC 1459

270
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:44,920
44 the weight stands now there are

271
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,840
things that VR be and any other

272
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,089
fragmentation including the reliable

273
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,620
fragment needs to do anyway thus there

274
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,070
needs to be an overview to explain those

275
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,750
things and if you do it wrong and if you

276
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,410
fall into one of those pitfalls then you

277
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:01,270
get very bad result avoid them so I

278
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,130
added quite a bit of text in the

279
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,770
document and we are the number of round

280
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:09,790
trips to just provide that which makes

281
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:14,770
it so that now the document as a pro

282
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,540
case text as it stands I don't know if

283
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:20,800
it's published or in the github repo but

284
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,780
it has a per case text which makes it so

285
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,439
that there is an excellent I Dave which

286
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:29,920
is where is the BCP 14 text to say what

287
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,330
does upper case meal and coming back to

288
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,729
the fact that if you have those Ibaka

289
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:36,790
steaks like you must swap fragments at

290
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,230
each heart we are back to the question

291
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:39,849
whether it's no match it's the start

292
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,650
track or informational

293
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,470
so so now religious to aspect right

294
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:47,050
there is more text than before which is

295
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,540
generic to any fragmentation there is a

296
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:52,479
pro case in there there is also all the

297
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,939
text about the

298
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,230
force in which you may fall the things

299
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,630
you have to do and things you have to

300
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,310
avoid and because of that we have

301
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,110
uppercase and even if it's a very

302
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:04,089
generic it cannot be implemented as is

303
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,280
because it's its high level it's more

304
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,938
like a fourth family of solution it

305
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,980
still gives you a monetary things to do

306
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,500
so question to the group I mean do we

307
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:22,630
want information all-star traction

308
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:25,900
question to sue rush as well yes I think

309
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:30,520
is normative personally speaking okay so

310
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:34,120
so I will add the BCP fourteen texts and

311
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,040
we publish I guess and thank you so much

312
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,020
Dave I mean that was you are very

313
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,020
responsive and all that was very good

314
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:46,870
that's it for this one so the the

315
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,668
fragments recovery also lives its own

316
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:53,199
life so later today

317
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,929
Aloha will present as the fragment

318
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,030
recovery that the Sheik a protocol

319
00:17:55,929 --> 00:18:02,429
provides that was designed at the LP one

320
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:06,270
working group which is a very

321
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:11,470
thought-out very well designed

322
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:13,960
fragmentation mechanism and one could

323
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,840
say that it kind of competes with this

324
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,450
one which I hope I don't know in which

325
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,600
details are going to go along but the

326
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,270
bottom line is one is very optimized for

327
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,260
one hub and I think it does a better job

328
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,700
than this one if there is just one hub

329
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,590
but the real problem that this draft

330
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,880
addresses is not when it's one huh

331
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,409
because we have to lay off two

332
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,570
acknowledgements in most of the six law

333
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,610
cases so to read the multi-hop prime

334
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,980
that this draft addresses and that's how

335
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,870
they differ it's not to talk I will not

336
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,850
talk about fragmentation because I agree

337
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:52,540
with you oh I would like to work a group

338
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:54,969
of people like you it's a bad joke okay

339
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,678
so so the only comments we had was

340
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,210
implementation commands by Martine so

341
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:02,200
thank you Martina if you're hearing us

342
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,580
today so that the discussion was it's

343
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,530
interesting I need to mention it because

344
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,279
the question was okay what if I'm

345
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,479
falling

346
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:12,639
this fragment and I hit the hub limit of

347
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:16,419
the packet obviously I cannot fall it

348
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:19,019
more and you would you would figure o is

349
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:21,399
it different if the packet is is

350
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:24,669
recompose that every up or if it's

351
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:27,399
fragmented and at the end of the day

352
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,529
that brings up the question is of I have

353
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:31,449
this fragmented c-clip and packet and

354
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:34,090
there is an arrow with it and the Euro

355
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,340
may come because it was fragmented or

356
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,468
because it was compressed by six low

357
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,478
maybe in the wrong fashion or something

358
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:43,479
or in a fashion that the next hub does

359
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:49,239
not understand versus it's a crime with

360
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:52,059
ipv6 itself like I'm tu like in this

361
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:54,639
case up limit or anything else how do

362
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:56,499
you report that to the source and it's

363
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:58,629
even worse than that who is the source

364
00:19:56,499 --> 00:20:00,789
because if your recomposing six the

365
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,879
planet every hub and the promised to do

366
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:05,619
with the 6lowpan compression or

367
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:07,959
fragmentation then maybe the source of

368
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:10,299
the prime is not you know the guy who

369
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,369
passed the packet at layer 3 at the

370
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:16,779
other hand of the mesh it's really hard

371
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:19,839
before you so how do we process ICMP

372
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:23,259
rose in general and to whom we send your

373
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,658
back and what goes into the packet for

374
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:27,570
instance if the problem is redo to to

375
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:29,799
the compression on the fragmentation and

376
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,869
you do what Martin did which is

377
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,418
recomposed the packet and then be on the

378
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:38,709
ICMP error with the recompose package

379
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:42,029
you lose all track of what was in the

380
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,619
compressed form and if Yahoo was there

381
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:49,299
then you lose the information about the

382
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:53,859
error so so seems to me that we kind of

383
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:57,549
overlooked all this ICMP or game mostly

384
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:59,379
if you have multi hubs and that could

385
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,739
deserve some attention by this group in

386
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:04,269
the future so I really I mean we

387
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:06,519
discussed what she could do she does

388
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:10,119
what she can I mean the problem is it's

389
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:12,879
actually unspecified so what she did was

390
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,678
proper but mostly for hop limit because

391
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,820
reads a problem of the ipv6 packet so

392
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,279
that's when it's kind of clear so she

393
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,220
recovers is the packets fine I would

394
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,140
argue I argued actually that she

395
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,240
did not need to recompose the packet

396
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,030
because the hop limit is in the first

397
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,470
fragment so she could have sent the

398
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,720
arrow back on the first fragment with

399
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,210
the first fragment in and then drop the

400
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,919
next fragments and the cool thing with

401
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,480
that is the arrow flies back to the

402
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,730
source maybe before all the fragments

403
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,470
are sent so that the source doesn't

404
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:44,370
waste bandwidth sending all the other

405
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:46,890
fragments so what she did was proper it

406
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,439
was actually not optimized but since

407
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,539
there is no spike right and it's not

408
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,179
specific to this fragment forwarding

409
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,740
draft so I said I don't see why we

410
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,480
should put the text in there but that

411
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:00,360
should be working to actually addresses

412
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,330
and that's pretty much my discussions

413
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:33,059
and the drafts are in the caring hands

414
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:35,158
of Suresh okay I'm going to present the

415
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:37,830
current status in the last update of the

416
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:49,080
draft and title ipv6 mesh over bluetooth

417
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:50,580
lowering energy using IP SP so first of

418
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,158
all let's take a look at the status of

419
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,530
the document the previous version which

420
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,860
was 0-5 passed working group last call

421
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:03,020
and then the Shepherd Rahul kindly

422
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:05,908
provided a review of 0-5 and then we

423
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:10,200
produce version 0-6 which is intended to

424
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:11,640
address the Shepards comments so now

425
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,270
let's take a look at the updates in this

426
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,789
last revision first is after a comment

427
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:22,799
by Rahul we found a few instances where

428
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:25,440
we were still using a ro where where as

429
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,870
we should have been using e a ro which

430
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,750
is the term defined in RFC eighty five

431
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,070
zero five this was actually a couple of

432
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:36,899
instances in the header compression

433
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:40,530
section then Rahul also commented on the

434
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:43,080
use of 6co he explained that perhaps the

435
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,240
six Co is not needed to be supported if

436
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,520
a single prefix is going to be used in

437
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,840
the network so we thought this was a

438
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,629
good idea and we decided to relax use of

439
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,559
six Co the the requirement on using the

440
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,990
CCO from a mast to me then there was a

441
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,158
third common which was mostly editorial

442
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:07,230
in intended to express a bit better some

443
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:12,149
sentence hopefully now it's more

444
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:14,580
readable and finally Rahul had also a

445
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:16,860
request to provide some diagram

446
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,549
illustrating the node joining procedure

447
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:23,879
so we did that we had the appendix B

448
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:26,490
which now contains the diagram that was

449
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,010
requested and also a text description of

450
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:33,090
what's happening in the diagram so this

451
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:35,730
is a quite typical message exchange

452
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:39,658
in this diagram the the new node is the

453
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:42,210
6ln in the figure so basically the six

454
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:46,980
line starts sending router solicitation

455
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:49,620
message so if there's some node a 6lr in

456
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,629
this case in in range of the new node

457
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,360
then it will reply with a router

458
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:57,990
advertisement so the new node will be

459
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,729
able to configure its global ipv6

460
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,480
address because it has now learned the

461
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:07,830
prefix in use and it will register the

462
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,119
ipv6 global address with each router so

463
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,220
then there will be the multi-hop

464
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,820
duplicate address detection procedure

465
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:18,720
and finally the 6rn will receive the

466
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:21,450
result of this procedure so this is all

467
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:26,210
regarding the updates in this new

468
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,210
version is there any question any common

469
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,940
okay so next is six low applicability

470
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,940
and use cases

471
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,529
hi

472
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,960
if a young gone home I present the sixth

473
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:24,029
row the use case they and applicability

474
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:26,669
document yeah so after last meeting they

475
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:29,519
are to obey the seventh version and a

476
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:32,789
Spurgeon so the seventh person was all

477
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:37,409
reflect by the decision of the authors

478
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:39,690
and a Spurgeon was updated I reflect or

479
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:42,179
Pascal comment so I think it's too fast

480
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:48,840
car for your since your review and

481
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:53,010
command so in this latest threat we have

482
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:56,129
the six six Road in Korea technology she

483
00:26:53,010 --> 00:27:01,200
WAV barely there clearly be context

484
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:06,539
really MSTP NFC PLC so the last the

485
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:09,510
eighth ripple edit that if that echo our

486
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:12,120
authors I decide not to include the SIP

487
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:16,080
floating layer technology I said in the

488
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,260
redder and this the comparison table

489
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,100
across six Road in Korea technology so G

490
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:28,110
will be Billy death usually MSTP NFC

491
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:33,600
piracy so test Oh visual with restore d

492
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:36,620
scg so in the sixth row deployment

493
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,149
scenario so originally we have poor

494
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:42,570
effect occurred six row deep romantic

495
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:46,860
scenario to fight image choice on this

496
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:49,860
repair see net Rissa T so among them we

497
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,370
remove jupyter mesh and white Sun

498
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:57,439
because the technology is based on a

499
00:27:53,370 --> 00:28:01,590
triple area to type in that poll so

500
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,620
currently or two or deployment scenario

501
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:06,230
such a lt3 pearcy yet riskier are

502
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,719
remaining

503
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:12,060
so we have the Qaeda line pod opting

504
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,020
we expect for example addressing modere

505
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,940
MTO consideration which was reloading

506
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,750
address Oh Simon had convention security

507
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,880
and encryption additional processing etc

508
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:27,750
so in the current rate is trapped we

509
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:31,560
have to each use case of the 86 road in

510
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:34,860
clear technology for example G wave or

511
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,669
it can be used to some at home for

512
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,679
example so really it can be used to can

513
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:46,850
be used to smartphone based interaction

514
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:49,340
and for example nep-chi can be used to

515
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,649
authority of the secure transfer and

516
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:58,350
prism prismatic good Piercy can be used

517
00:28:52,650 --> 00:29:01,860
to smart grid ok so all this is dose or

518
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,750
summarize the command after the last

519
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,990
meeting and the email discussion between

520
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,440
all sorts so I remember that in the last

521
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:11,310
meeting

522
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,550
maybe the escape documented this draft

523
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:17,159
but we just caught the arrow down and we

524
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:20,100
must have focus on something because it

525
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:23,550
is a little too broad so I agree and I

526
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:26,790
thanks to your command and we also have

527
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:30,389
some agreement today so to do this we

528
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:32,460
decide ok we must adjust the scope so

529
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,640
narrow down and pocos so previous

530
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:39,330
version they trapped in 29 PS so

531
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:42,270
currently is 25 fish for fish reviews

532
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:45,449
and we tried to make consistent between

533
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,580
each section so email discussion

534
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,910
paternosters so we determine 6 rod

535
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,000
technology so we there are some items

536
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:56,700
for regarding this repeatable related

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,970
technology our arab scope so in the

538
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:04,950
previous version LT MP she is included

539
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:07,770
but we removed and we try to focus on

540
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:10,260
technology that have been handled after

541
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:13,710
iris original 15 dirt-poor

542
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,410
so that's the reason we delete some

543
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:19,350
related parts of the edit auto dock with

544
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,510
Interpol and other technology which are

545
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,139
not related to arab seal or working

546
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,220
document

547
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,409
arabs

548
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:29,309
you temper I remember their past car

549
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:33,450
said we have the double lane aah

550
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:36,950
threat in v6 or watching row but it was

551
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:41,909
torn up to two years there are no active

552
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:47,250
activity so this reason we don't hinder

553
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:50,850
that left in this document here so I did

554
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:54,780
he explain tour reaction from document

555
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:58,590
from Pascal okay this is the decision

556
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:01,740
bTW no sirs so I said that really move

557
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,990
later person who is the editor to the

558
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:08,659
kitchen table poor and editor template

559
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:14,640
Interpol echo so the section or 3.7 4.1

560
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:18,780
4.2 and appendix 8 8 v imp river trip

561
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:21,480
are removed so update able to so in the

562
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:25,320
previous module we used specified

563
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:31,880
expression but in this opera we do move

564
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:35,250
specify expression and we are beside the

565
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:40,530
606 road in cleared canal ug and we try

566
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:44,220
to reduce the content and etc ok all

567
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:46,940
this is the third order flies to the

568
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,980
command prompt ask our so Pascal

569
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:54,510
suggests that it is better to reverse

570
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:56,760
the editor template up hold standards

571
00:31:54,510 --> 00:32:01,289
and include our reference so we do that

572
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:04,710
and Pascal says that pre-birth disrepair

573
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:08,460
see content is a little out of doTERRA

574
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:11,340
so we check that so I found there yes it

575
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,690
is all little to all so we try to catch

576
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:19,500
the contest features of g3p RC document

577
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:24,630
and Pascal or give some text tour to

578
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:28,559
address assignment it is a little - not

579
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:32,730
the proper so thanks to Pascal again so

580
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,360
i refresh those texts of the address

581
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,760
assignment rectus

582
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,409
okay oh this is the next time so I'm

583
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,650
asking of the floor for regarding to the

584
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:48,080
scope of this rep though people

585
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:51,380
basically the six role in cleared

586
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,770
chronology to make the score narrow down

587
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:58,059
we treat I Tripoli original pitch in the

588
00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:02,600
poor and I deducted in the poor echo and

589
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:05,210
also we delete six Road implemented

590
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:09,379
scenario for example to fight a mesh and

591
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:12,559
my son so test or resort we have only

592
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:17,540
two six through diplomatic scenario that

593
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:22,160
is based on peer see so after dose of a

594
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:25,610
mission the lemme give some top command

595
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:29,350
so the first one is related to this so

596
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:35,090
he suggests some solution how to handle

597
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:41,090
six roti fermentation REO and let me

598
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:44,059
also suggested in the section five for

599
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:47,178
the political base is reloading it would

600
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:49,790
be better to have equal tempered for

601
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:52,880
material thing or arrow ad n diverges

602
00:33:49,790 --> 00:34:00,080
rapira C so in the next revision are we

603
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:05,120
or reflect this comment yet or thank you

604
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,129
so I'm asking taught or and want to hear

605
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,000
your opinion to regarding of the scope

606
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:14,270
of this draft is it the best way to

607
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,010
delete many part which is relate to edge

608
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:24,710
to that I Tripoli Aries auto-type hit

609
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:27,290
Interpol and echo and 6 double aah also

610
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:31,010
to fight image and the wiser is the best

611
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:35,409
way so I want to it is appreciated

612
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,409
through or hear your opinion

613
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,899
I'm just not too clear what the result

614
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,869
of if you declare the amount of scope

615
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:58,230
like I think Jupiter mesh is kind of

616
00:34:54,869 --> 00:35:00,839
dead now so it's kind of out of scope

617
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,150
because it's not there right on the

618
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,500
other hand when Sun is highly deployed

619
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:09,809
and and lively and expertise in to etc

620
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,730
so I guess it's interesting for the

621
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:13,530
reader at least to know that it exists

622
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:15,869
even if you don't go into details of

623
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,339
what's being done there because I guess

624
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,619
the reason why it's out of scope it's

625
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:22,650
not the main of this another entity that

626
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,390
specifies it and you can't really apart

627
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,160
from saying it's there and it does high

628
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,690
level things you can't go into the

629
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,009
detail of what it does because it's kind

630
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:34,260
of property oh well it's the ions right

631
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:36,329
so I would say you still need to say it

632
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,579
exists and used it's you still need to

633
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,319
say it does use this technology because

634
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:42,059
you're there to say this technology is

635
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:45,558
deployed so it's important that it's

636
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:47,819
mentioned yeah 15 for a the reason why

637
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:49,289
you are not expected to talk too much

638
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:52,890
about it is because now it does not

639
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:55,049
exist anymore it is wrapped up into 15 4

640
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,470
so when you say 15 before you actually

641
00:35:55,049 --> 00:36:03,450
include th CH because that's part on the

642
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:05,009
mains back since 2015 so that's it's not

643
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,069
worth mentioning it for a reader of

644
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:11,520
today and because your your reference is

645
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:14,220
to 15 for without a date that includes

646
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,549
the SCH for anything college today so

647
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:23,549
you don't need to mention for obviously

648
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:26,640
the low pan in 6lowpan is 15 for so it's

649
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:31,230
hard to say 15 for is out of scope that

650
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,000
seems a bit harsh so and I'm not clear

651
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:38,369
what you mean by saying 15 fives out of

652
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,410
scope I think but it belongs right 15 4

653
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:41,069
is the core one core technology for

654
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,549
6lowpan

655
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:46,170
that 6 low extended to other so I'm not

656
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:48,500
clear what you mean by 15 4 is out of

657
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,500
scope

658
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,620
suresh krisshnan i think what they are

659
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,029
saying is like now they don't want to

660
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,500
describe the link layer technologies in

661
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:59,270
the draft right I think like you just a

662
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,350
reference should be okay I don't think

663
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:01,730
they want like they want to talk more

664
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,799
about the use cases of it rather than

665
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,410
the link layer technology I think that's

666
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,270
what I understood from but the next

667
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:10,310
points is that because 15-4 is out of

668
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:12,500
scope Ison is also out of scope so which

669
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,299
makes I think everything is out of scope

670
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,800
for a use case document personally like

671
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,330
I like Pascal's thing I will just say

672
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,620
hey like this is probably applicable to

673
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,000
these technologies and be done with it

674
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,279
right without like spending too much

675
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,430
time on the technology itself does that

676
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,200
make sense okay but any use cases

677
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,600
pertaining to these technologies are

678
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,890
still in scope absolutely again like I

679
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,540
think it specifically says the link

680
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,940
layer technology description is also a

681
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:37,550
co-op right that's pretty much it okay

682
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,920
thank you one question so we have this

683
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,110
new work on the canvas which is going to

684
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,230
be presented later do you see any new

685
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:51,980
use cases coming in because of six to

686
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:54,710
over can actually we must carefully

687
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:58,820
check that campus so if we bought sure

688
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:02,380
and it has some relation to six row and

689
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:06,070
we have a chance to capture the canvas

690
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,420
but I don't like no I cannot answer your

691
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:10,580
so in that case we just keep the

692
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,260
document alive for for some more time

693
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,640
because we might get some more use case

694
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:17,630
it's the more important thing is the

695
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:20,660
activity must be live in this area so we

696
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:24,350
and you're not asking for workgroups

697
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:26,440
class call it yeah yes okay hey thank

698
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,440
you

699
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:54,410
so I'm going to talk about the ipv6 of a

700
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:57,589
PRC networks so on some recall of the

701
00:38:54,410 --> 00:39:01,219
background the objective of this draft

702
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:05,299
is to define ipv6 at the adaptation

703
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:08,150
layer for constraint PLC's and it is

704
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:10,910
based on some already done IETF

705
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:14,119
standards and some extensions to these

706
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:17,569
standards and the scope of this draft is

707
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:21,699
the constraint PLC's which includes the

708
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:26,569
itu-t G doubt 99 0-3

709
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:31,640
9000 1.1 and 90 1.2 and for the status

710
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:36,229
of the draft he who was started in 2017

711
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:40,359
and it is adopted in this year in

712
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:43,968
February and for the version 0 0 we just

713
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:46,848
uploaded eight eyes working of document

714
00:39:43,969 --> 00:39:49,130
and with just a simple change of the

715
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:52,430
title and some ID row modifications

716
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:55,130
based on Carson's comments and in the

717
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,779
version 0 1 we have done some

718
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:00,289
modifications in the structure and

719
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:05,180
updates the neighbor discovery section

720
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:08,930
and now we'll talk about some

721
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:13,910
modifications for now we have removed

722
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:18,890
the section about extension as the sixth

723
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:23,029
row after adaptation there it is we just

724
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:26,779
remove it for now and because it is the

725
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:29,839
extension about the about the the

726
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:32,869
comment frame header it is unique in it

727
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,788
is currently unique in the activity G

728
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:38,719
dot WA 99203

729
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:42,589
and in the other two pieces in the draft

730
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:46,339
we just have not use case for for this

731
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:49,430
comment from a header yet and there is

732
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:53,869
some inconsistency in fact in the order

733
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:58,690
of the common frame header in 2009 9:03

734
00:40:53,869 --> 00:41:04,039
because in this one under the Arcia 80

735
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:06,170
666 because in the G dot 19 and 0-3 the

736
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:11,529
command frame header is the last one but

737
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:16,039
in the best definition of our RFC 80-66

738
00:41:11,529 --> 00:41:19,940
it is before the the dispatch header of

739
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:24,769
the header compression so insistency

740
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:29,269
exists so I I just want to ask the

741
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:31,968
working groups opinion if this draft is

742
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:33,890
authorized to solve this inconsistency

743
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:37,400
or we just leave this section

744
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:39,379
informational out we just do not talk

745
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:52,190
about it anymore

746
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:56,150
so what is happening perhaps one point

747
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:58,150
is whether we could receive for example

748
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:01,430
on the mailing list some elaborate

749
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,499
information about the nature of the

750
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:08,989
inconsistency like what's happening in

751
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:14,868
both itu-t and I think I has sent the

752
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:17,719
two formats of the headers it is just it

753
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:19,369
is just why is the last one the for

754
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:26,089
example the common header is the last

755
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:29,299
one and in the in the in the RCI t66 it

756
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:32,779
is it be inside that dispatch header is

757
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:39,380
the last one so it is which-which header

758
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:45,130
is the last one actually yeah so I ever

759
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:45,130
sent four formats of the of the headers

760
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:53,509
Pascal here my memory is that we agreed

761
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:55,900
on 80 to 66 with the g3 people they came

762
00:42:53,509 --> 00:43:00,229
in the room and we agree to that format

763
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:04,819
and that the specification was supposed

764
00:43:00,229 --> 00:43:06,259
to to adapt to that I mean and now

765
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:10,670
you're saying the

766
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:12,500
but not consistent I mean we should have

767
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,359
a kind of a liaison question or

768
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,460
something right I mean they they did

769
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:18,650
they were supposed to follow the RFC and

770
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,710
to do the thing as we specified with

771
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,840
this we specified the escape for them

772
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:26,930
and now you say they don't choose it as

773
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:29,869
specified and that troubles me I think I

774
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:31,368
mean we cannot really you can at the HF

775
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,170
you can only be consistent with the

776
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:36,500
other RFC is right so you have to be

777
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:38,630
consistent with 1866 I'm just concerned

778
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,460
that you're telling us that your tu T

779
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,109
which came here so do we defend this

780
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:47,000
thing together or not did not comply

781
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:50,060
with it that troubles me yeah I actually

782
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,900
when you see the current version of the

783
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:56,299
G dot 99 there were three it is there it

784
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,500
is told that okay this coming from

785
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:01,550
header is the last one

786
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:04,369
but do they in that's sorry I don't know

787
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:07,609
those have not seen that spec but can

788
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:10,730
you check if the reference 8 0 66

789
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:12,350
because I they did it's not much if kind

790
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,030
of normative reference they should obey

791
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,040
what they RFC sighs because they say

792
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,990
they basically say we are using the RFC

793
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,630
and then then they do something which is

794
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:22,879
opposite to the RFC and what what do you

795
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,859
give the pound right you're supposed to

796
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:29,660
be on up on the RFC to do the next RFC

797
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:31,160
and so obviously I understand you have a

798
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,629
conflict you cannot solve it but the

799
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,759
only thing you can do within this form

800
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,460
and this group is to be consistent with

801
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,650
the other RCS okay now we can talk to I

802
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,060
to you and ask a why are you not

803
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:46,070
consistent with the RFC we'll get

804
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:48,020
together okay okay so here has come yeah

805
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,520
suresh krisshnan so just like going a

806
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,130
little bit further like I don't think we

807
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,810
can resolve this here okay okay very

808
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,640
frank right because if somebody's gonna

809
00:44:53,810 --> 00:45:00,109
do something else somewhere that's not

810
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:02,450
much we can do about it I would say the

811
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:04,819
itu-t needs to fix this if they're doing

812
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,200
this in a non inconsistent way like with

813
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:11,930
our standards it needs to get fixed

814
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:13,279
there right otherwise this draft rightly

815
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,080
it's gonna get stuck somewhere because

816
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,230
if it's inconsistent with our RFC's it's

817
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,740
not gonna progress right so if you want

818
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,060
some help

819
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,979
we can probably

820
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:23,690
right up a liaison statement and try to

821
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:26,330
find I don't know if you have a liaison

822
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:28,490
towards g19 903 right but we will try to

823
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:30,740
figure out if we can send a message to

824
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,720
them saying hey your usage of this is

825
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,240
inconsistent with how we specified it

826
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,009
that's something we can do and see how

827
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,169
things go but if you have any colleagues

828
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,750
who are going to itu-t who are working

829
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:43,760
on this like you should talk to them and

830
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,240
tell them to fix it over there okay I

831
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,200
think that would be the right wait so

832
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,629
another question do you have any

833
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,700
suggestion on the text should we hit

834
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:57,650
this section or should we just remove

835
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:59,990
its phone now I will just hold on it to

836
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:02,750
figure out like how itu-t is gonna react

837
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,569
on this okay okay and then go from there

838
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:06,770
so we can sit down with the chairs and

839
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,210
probably they can work on some statement

840
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:12,470
to put on the mailing list and I can

841
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:14,660
send it through the IAB - so when one

842
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,669
point is in in the previous version of

843
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:19,580
the document you had a sentence which is

844
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:25,280
the inconsistencies is being solved in

845
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:29,500
itu-t yeah so one group from you know

846
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:32,510
scope of one group in activity but so

847
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:35,240
does this mean that it's not being

848
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:40,119
considered like they are not considering

849
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,118
solving this is they are aware of this

850
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,649
not fixing it there's not much we can do

851
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,410
about it

852
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,599
and we cannot publish this with like

853
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:57,500
obvious contradiction to our published

854
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:59,150
standards yeah yeah so let's probably

855
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,440
have an offline just like we have a

856
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,630
shorter session today so we have a

857
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,500
little bit time left and we can have a

858
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:09,260
chat about it okay the drafters

859
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,089
mentioned that it quotes one of the ITU

860
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:15,770
drafts where it is going to be resolved

861
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:17,810
so yeah so uh draft which is going to

862
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:21,170
resolve it so it seems to be on the path

863
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:25,190
- yeah so my question is actually issued

864
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:28,880
we should show the way included this

865
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:30,349
section is this draft wait for if it's

866
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,580
in the process of being resolved we just

867
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:37,910
wait until yeah so actually

868
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:40,700
this feature is just unique to the at UT

869
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,410
PLC it is nothing related to the other

870
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:45,560
two PLC's

871
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:48,109
so if we just focus something in common

872
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:55,369
for all the three PLC's I think we can

873
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:58,190
remove it right okay okay and we have

874
00:47:55,369 --> 00:48:01,700
done some updates about the neighbor

875
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:07,480
discovery section while if the update is

876
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:11,509
to update the RCA 65 sorry

877
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:15,050
67 75 update into FC eighty five zero

878
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:17,690
five and we have divided the address

879
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:21,080
registration into two scene two

880
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:24,320
situations one is the root over mode and

881
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:27,590
another way is the measurement and in

882
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,170
the root over modes for the link local

883
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:33,109
addresses they should only be registered

884
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:36,050
to the to the six-hour which is the

885
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:38,779
rotor and the folder known link local

886
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:43,580
addresses should be registered to the to

887
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:45,830
the registrar and via the neighbor

888
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:52,910
solicitation and the NEPA advertisement

889
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:56,029
and the GRDC and if RFC 3505 is rotate

890
00:48:52,910 --> 00:49:00,649
the EDR and the EDC messages are used

891
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:04,250
and the if the address is are signed by

892
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:07,849
on DTV v6 or it has generated via some

893
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:13,460
unique link local link layer addresses

894
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:15,530
and in this case the DoD must not be

895
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:19,250
utilized and the for the machine remote

896
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:21,619
each device is link local neighbor at

897
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:25,070
the u.s. rate to the six fer so the

898
00:49:21,619 --> 00:49:29,180
registration viralize and a message is

899
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:33,290
should be fine so no no dar DC or EDR

900
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:37,848
EDSA message I used in this case and the

901
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:40,450
for the future work we think that in the

902
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:44,510
structure a source of the inconsistency

903
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:46,879
we have mentioned it yet we think that

904
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:50,660
in the for the structure we

905
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:54,440
I've covered almost all the other

906
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:58,759
technique points for the PLC's so but we

907
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:01,930
need help to help us improve it so any

908
00:49:58,759 --> 00:50:01,930
comments No

909
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:12,439
okay so other than the discussion about

910
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:23,420
the inconsistency is there anyone who

911
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:25,599
like to review this draft thank you very

912
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,599
much

913
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:33,220
it was long

914
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,209
the next presentation is on v6 over can

915
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,640
but I

916
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:51,600
it's a remote presentation but we don't

917
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:55,009
see the presenter in media couette so

918
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:55,009
we'll move on to the next one

919
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:14,370
six slow and Lauren okay thank you

920
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:16,410
so I will talk about work what is doing

921
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:18,810
is done at the LP one working group so

922
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:20,819
it's about compression and fragmentation

923
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:23,850
so I will as I say will not talk much

924
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,950
about fragmentation but I will focus

925
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:28,460
more on compression and we have of

926
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,779
course things that are common because

927
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,360
when we start a group we have a good

928
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:37,230
source of inspiration that was six low

929
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:40,140
and off on some offer a command to the

930
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:42,240
both group so you will find some common

931
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,609
things but in fact the applicability

932
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,910
statement is totally different because

933
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:51,090
we are in very very constrained network

934
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:53,040
so here you have some figure about the

935
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:57,300
speed of this network so some people

936
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,160
talk about milli bit networks it's for

937
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,620
example sig Fox if you take the duty

938
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:04,500
cycle is one bit per second so it's a

939
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:09,000
very very limited bandwidth very very

940
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:10,680
small frame and you are limited in with

941
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,020
the number of frames you can send per

942
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:15,540
day so you have a lot of restriction you

943
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,270
have also a restriction for example then

944
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:20,850
the device can sleep most of the time so

945
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:22,770
you cannot send darling message all the

946
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:25,319
time you have to wait right these

947
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:28,290
dividers and messages so the constraint

948
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:32,040
of the traffic is also different at what

949
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:35,759
we you have in 6lo network what is

950
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:39,210
common of all this technology is that we

951
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,490
have a star topology so each device talk

952
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:44,640
to only one point on we don't have

953
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:47,819
routing around so it means that this way

954
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,680
we can also have sanitation so if we

955
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,260
look at the architecture we have a star

956
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,109
topology and we have device

957
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:58,200
that talks with different by different

958
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:59,850
means to a central point and so if we

959
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:03,118
want to do compression and fragmentation

960
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:05,759
we will do it between the device on this

961
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:09,060
central point here are also one very

962
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,310
important assumption what we took its

963
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,890
ads we know the traffic sent by the

964
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:16,890
device because it's a limited device and

965
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:19,049
you put your application on it and you

966
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:20,730
can control what as a friend that has

967
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:24,240
been sent or received by this

968
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:26,130
application so in shake what we do is

969
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,680
that we have a context for compression

970
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:31,850
decompression so it's on the device and

971
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:35,279
it must be known also in the core of

972
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:37,890
compression of the compressor so the

973
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,590
documents now right now IT structure so

974
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:42,600
we have one draft that explains three

975
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:45,000
things so it's the mini explain it

976
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,880
better than me but it's divided in three

977
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,520
parts the first one describe a generic

978
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:53,580
compression mechanism so we don't say it

979
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:56,160
for UDP IP it just fills and we say how

980
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:59,940
we compress a packet made of fields then

981
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:02,460
we have a section on fragmentation so

982
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:05,580
three murdered fragmentation that take

983
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:07,680
advantage of the technology on I try to

984
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,900
limit the number of feedback because for

985
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:13,259
example downlink it's a very scary

986
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,810
source and then from these two points we

987
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:20,660
have a third point that gives an example

988
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:23,970
of fragment of compression for UDP an IP

989
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:26,310
we have over documents one that explain

990
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:29,580
how to do coop compression so coop

991
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:33,660
compression can be done alone or can be

992
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:36,450
done with UDP IP if needed so we don't

993
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:40,649
take each layer but we can do cross

994
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:43,560
cross layer compression and we have also

995
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:46,109
add a adaptation of the ship mechanism

996
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:50,520
to different technology like sig Foxx

997
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:53,130
Aloha one 3gpp X direction so how it

998
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,609
works in brief you are the package that

999
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:59,970
arrived to your compressor so you have a

1000
00:54:56,609 --> 00:55:04,830
description of all the possible format

1001
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:06,270
of what you are sending and when if you

1002
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:09,630
find something that works

1003
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:11,700
that corresponds if a rule that

1004
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,220
correspond to your packet then you will

1005
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:17,040
send a rule number on at the other end

1006
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:19,680
since we have the same information then

1007
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:24,300
we can from the rule number reconstruct

1008
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:26,669
Vader so in the vocabulary of shake this

1009
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:29,520
description of a pedra of ITER's is

1010
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:32,730
caller rule it's identified by your ID

1011
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,940
the set of floor is color context and

1012
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:39,420
for the compression as in 6lo we can

1013
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:41,730
have the route ID plus some information

1014
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,840
that come from the ocean or later but we

1015
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:49,260
send on on the radio so a rule is

1016
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:51,120
defined by different element so the

1017
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,520
first thing to identify a rule is that

1018
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,950
you have a rule ID visual ID is

1019
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,750
absolutely unstructured so it does a

1020
00:55:55,950 --> 00:56:02,879
flat numbering and it can be used to

1021
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:06,630
identify compression or fragmentation

1022
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,280
work on the size of your ID may vary so

1023
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:12,090
if you have frequent rules they can have

1024
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:15,150
a small value and unfree controls I have

1025
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:17,430
a longer value then a recompression rudy

1026
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:20,780
structure of this way you have the first

1027
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:23,609
field of the first column of these rules

1028
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:26,250
describing the field that you are trying

1029
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:28,440
to compress so you have a feel ID but

1030
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:31,470
say for example it's ipv6 version or

1031
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:34,740
it's it's UDP port Xterra extra you have

1032
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:37,529
a field position so it's quite strange

1033
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:40,410
if you look at IP UDP but in coop for

1034
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:42,900
example you can repeat several time the

1035
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:45,000
same field either you're a path so we

1036
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:48,540
give the position if it's repeated

1037
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,730
several time on theater and then we have

1038
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:53,190
the direction which is something that is

1039
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:55,590
very specific to LP ones network because

1040
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:59,280
since it's a star topology we can have

1041
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:01,440
uplink or downlink communications so we

1042
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,900
with this information we notified a

1043
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,510
specific field and then we have a

1044
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:09,120
matching part so the matching part is

1045
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:13,260
with two element one is a target value

1046
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:15,420
so it's the value but you want to too

1047
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:17,760
much and we have a matching operator

1048
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:19,140
that tells you how to do the matching

1049
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,829
with the field

1050
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:25,920
so we have four currently four different

1051
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:28,470
definition are done one is equal so you

1052
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,029
must find this target value in your

1053
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:32,069
field yeah

1054
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:35,999
ignore it mean that you don't care about

1055
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:39,538
the value you have also MSB so you have

1056
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:41,399
the first bit must match and a matching

1057
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:44,069
list it means that you have a list of

1058
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,460
value and you expect to find one of

1059
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:50,220
these value so our Sheikh worth to say

1060
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:51,900
walks to select a rule is that all the

1061
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,720
fields that are described in the rule

1062
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:57,900
much match with all the field in your

1063
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,538
packet if it's a case then you can

1064
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:03,150
select the rule and apply the

1065
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:05,970
compression action that are described

1066
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:08,369
here and this way you have gives you a

1067
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:11,220
sir ization what you send on your radio

1068
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:14,460
on on the other side when you receive

1069
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:16,890
something you receive first rule ID so

1070
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:19,319
with this you can identify the rule and

1071
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:23,279
then you have the residue that comes

1072
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:25,440
from the compression that can be can

1073
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:27,809
help to reconstruct the original packet

1074
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,849
using a decompression action which is

1075
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:32,519
symmetric to the compression action in

1076
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:35,849
the component side so that's in brief

1077
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:39,930
how the compression works so I try to

1078
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:44,069
make some comparison between 6lo

1079
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:46,078
behavior and shake so we first about the

1080
00:58:44,069 --> 00:58:48,089
context so context is a very difficult

1081
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,940
world because everybody has this notion

1082
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:53,578
of context but what we can say that in

1083
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,589
six law we have no state for compression

1084
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:59,910
decompression it means that you take a

1085
00:58:55,589 --> 00:59:01,739
packet you apply what is given in the

1086
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:03,569
bit map at the beginning and then you

1087
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:06,089
forget this packet and you go to the

1088
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:10,339
next one so every packet is compressed

1089
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:15,239
in the individually and rules are known

1090
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:17,489
by the implementation because you create

1091
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:19,410
your bitmap and you say if I have this

1092
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:21,900
bit I'm doing this this this and this

1093
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:25,558
in shake is the same thing about

1094
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:27,960
compression right now we take a packet

1095
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,779
and we do compression and then we forget

1096
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,339
about this packet and we do we go to the

1097
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:32,950
compression another packet so here it's

1098
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,960
similar

1099
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:36,759
the difference is that here when you

1100
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:39,370
receive a rule ID you don't know what to

1101
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,980
do if you don't have the rule so the

1102
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:47,830
rule explain you what will be the

1103
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:51,850
behavior so in in 6lo we have a bitmap

1104
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:54,460
that can be compared with a rule ID but

1105
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:56,860
in 6lo it's fixed and it gives you how

1106
00:59:54,460 --> 01:00:00,820
you do the compression as I say before

1107
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:03,580
shake the rule ID is just a pointer to a

1108
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:06,150
rule that will tell you how to do the

1109
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:09,610
compression the advantage of having no

1110
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:11,620
semantics is that you can have different

1111
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:15,550
lengths and you don't have to structure

1112
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:18,069
this this information for compression

1113
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:22,420
and decompression action they are also

1114
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:24,790
quite similar in with 6lo so we have

1115
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:27,900
sent a lidded mapping and computed they

1116
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:31,840
are not exactly the same name but it's a

1117
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:35,350
what a similar only shake we have also

1118
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:39,550
MSB LSB so it's in UDP you can do it in

1119
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:43,180
six low but it's not generic in in shake

1120
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:45,850
and it can be extensible extensible if

1121
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:50,230
you want you can add new compression the

1122
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:53,890
compression action so in shake in six no

1123
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:57,790
it is the RFC vets fix how you apply the

1124
01:00:53,890 --> 01:01:00,279
compression to ipv6 header in shake is

1125
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:06,100
the rule that defines of a behavior and

1126
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:07,450
you select one of reaction so just yes I

1127
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:13,210
would like to ask a question who has

1128
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:17,890
read one of the sheik draft right lot of

1129
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:20,410
people so we what I think is very

1130
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:22,480
variable from Sheik and maybe we can

1131
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:24,129
work together at six low with that is

1132
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,260
that we define a generic field

1133
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:29,230
compression mechanism that can be

1134
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:36,070
applied to anything not only ipv6 or our

1135
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:38,020
UDP and to a lot of either and so maybe

1136
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:40,680
it's time now to see how we can work

1137
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:43,990
together for example to a pride co-op

1138
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,149
compression over six low or a thing like

1139
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:48,339
this so that was

1140
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,260
presentation of what we have done so if

1141
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:52,650
you have question or comment you're

1142
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,650
welcome

1143
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:03,430
remove from Hawaii so actually for me

1144
01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:06,848
Sheik is just like you have a dictionary

1145
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:09,279
at both sides right indicates the number

1146
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:11,950
of you and you can do the compression

1147
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:15,520
and decompression so what do you think

1148
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:17,770
in this case is a mesh 2/6 oh you mean

1149
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,140
that we should do some extensions in the

1150
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:23,230
control plane to indicate the rule or

1151
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:27,400
something like that or maybe all the

1152
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:29,190
other contacts here so the in other

1153
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:33,250
words the dictionary should be

1154
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:36,609
pre-installed yes this is one solution

1155
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:38,829
I have no real idea how to implement it

1156
01:02:36,609 --> 01:02:40,779
but what is important in Shaykh is that

1157
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:43,270
you have a point to point rules so it

1158
01:02:40,779 --> 01:02:47,440
means that and if you have a rule number

1159
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:50,650
ten for one Association another rule

1160
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:53,049
number ten can be totally different for

1161
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:56,380
another Association so it means that you

1162
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:59,799
don't have unity of rules number for all

1163
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:03,250
your devices so if we want to apply in a

1164
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:07,029
mesh network it means that ever we try

1165
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:09,640
to have unity in lady or we have to take

1166
01:03:07,029 --> 01:03:12,970
into account the source and then the

1167
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,950
rule number and the other thing is that

1168
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:17,980
since we the direction for example

1169
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:20,589
cannot be used because in mesh there is

1170
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:23,559
no up and down so you can receive in

1171
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:26,109
both directions so you mean that there

1172
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:29,859
could be some inconsistency of the row

1173
01:03:26,109 --> 01:03:36,759
ID in different you have to to take care

1174
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:39,190
of this okay okay okay thank you for

1175
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:43,960
this presentation in this work I think

1176
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:45,940
this is an interesting topic so from

1177
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:49,599
some abstract point of view I agree that

1178
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:51,460
she could be viewed as a superset to

1179
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,230
some of the functionality that is

1180
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,480
already in 6lowpan header compression

1181
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:58,270
for example the stateless part of sixty

1182
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,520
to eighty two and I think it makes sense

1183
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:02,910
to analyze this

1184
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:07,360
example in 6lowpan header compression

1185
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:10,359
typically in the best case an IP UDP had

1186
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:12,610
ipv6 UDP compress header would have a

1187
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,970
size in the best case of six to seven

1188
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:15,400
bytes

1189
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:18,490
whereas with sheik it could be easily

1190
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,850
one or two bytes for example there's a

1191
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:23,589
trick which is in cheek there's this

1192
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:27,250
information that context which is

1193
01:04:23,590 --> 01:04:30,670
assumed to be static like forever let's

1194
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:33,400
say and basically if you know in advance

1195
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:35,410
how your packets or packet headers will

1196
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,040
look like you can take advantage of that

1197
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:42,339
so I guess that the design for 6lowpan

1198
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:44,740
was a bit more generic because maybe the

1199
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:46,690
static cannot be sorry that the context

1200
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,120
cannot be a static like that but perhaps

1201
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,340
there's a subset of 6lowpan scenarios

1202
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:56,109
that may benefit from sheik header

1203
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:58,780
compression one question to the room do

1204
01:04:56,110 --> 01:05:00,850
you see any interest in doing chic for

1205
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:07,090
mesh networks where we actually need

1206
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:09,520
context distribution or I will say it

1207
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:10,870
depends of the constraint of the Sheik

1208
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:15,340
networks you are the trade-off between

1209
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:20,049
the effort to care to send the rule

1210
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:22,270
everywhere and the benefits of doing do

1211
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:24,070
we have such do we have a study where

1212
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:26,050
such networks are documented where it

1213
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:33,130
makes sense to actually go apply Sheik

1214
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:34,840
in sixth oh I don't know maybe in in the

1215
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,940
white Sun maybe it could be interesting

1216
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,310
to see because they have both topology

1217
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:41,590
could be enhanced this draft with with

1218
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:45,460
that data where where it makes sense to

1219
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:47,230
bring in Sheik in sex law okay yeah

1220
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:50,620
custom oh man this probably has been

1221
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:57,220
said in one way or another but I would

1222
01:05:50,620 --> 01:06:03,420
just like to keep in mind that both 600

1223
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:06,819
and Shaykh have context they differ in

1224
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:09,520
how extensive this context is so in six

1225
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:12,280
law we can essentially only provide a

1226
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,290
few addresses that then can be used by

1227
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,750
the six to eight

1228
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:19,540
- compression mechanism to compress some

1229
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:24,210
some addresses a little bit while shake

1230
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:27,300
of course has this extensive mechanism

1231
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:32,440
in shake so far the assumption has been

1232
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:34,660
you provision this per pair in sixth law

1233
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:38,070
the assumption has been you provisioned

1234
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:43,420
this per network or we talked about area

1235
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:47,350
context or whole 6lowpan shares the the

1236
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:50,110
context and of course you you can open

1237
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:53,980
this up again and and shake it in quite

1238
01:06:50,110 --> 01:07:00,130
different ways so if we did a sixth law

1239
01:06:53,980 --> 01:07:04,270
with prepare context that would feel a

1240
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:07,720
little bit different or if we did shake

1241
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:09,790
by distributing the information to

1242
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,609
everybody that what for you are

1243
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:14,880
different and so on so I think there are

1244
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:19,510
a number of combinations one can could

1245
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:22,540
look into here and it would indeed be

1246
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:24,820
interesting to see are there use cases

1247
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:27,370
where these combinations actually make

1248
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:29,620
it make sense and if yes what what is

1249
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:33,430
the level of efficiency that actually

1250
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:37,109
can be achieved but I think the the main

1251
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:40,480
difference is again how do you

1252
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:42,940
distribute the state who gets what state

1253
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,000
and how extensive is the set of

1254
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:47,290
compression actions you actually can

1255
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,090
express and of course in the latter part

1256
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:59,230
shake really is way further than 10 6

1257
01:07:52,090 --> 01:08:02,710
long way at scale yeah there's also this

1258
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:04,930
concept of backward compatibility etc so

1259
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:08,050
what I just looked at is how much space

1260
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:10,000
we we have in the energy field of the

1261
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:14,050
6lowpan compression because one way of

1262
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:16,839
using shake and you mentioned why son

1263
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:19,299
when way of using shake is to actually

1264
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:21,220
leave the other compression to 6lowpan

1265
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:22,839
because it's doing it and the

1266
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,910
intermediate nodes know what to do about

1267
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:27,068
it and we know how to frog fragment and

1268
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:27,790
for the fragments of our Monte harp etc

1269
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,730
so

1270
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:32,850
could think about leaving IP compression

1271
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:35,858
to 6lo just for backward compatibility

1272
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:40,180
within your mesh but upgrade some

1273
01:08:35,859 --> 01:08:43,510
endpoints to have a new NHC next in the

1274
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:46,810
compression for check so instead of

1275
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:49,000
saying the next error is UDP right which

1276
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:52,000
we do today or you have this we don't

1277
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,279
really compress there's a list then we

1278
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,250
could say oh there is this other sort of

1279
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:58,870
next data which is check and the cool

1280
01:08:57,250 --> 01:09:03,609
thing now is you could transport shake

1281
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:05,160
for the upper layers and still use six

1282
01:09:03,609 --> 01:09:07,030
low two for the packet inside the mesh

1283
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,670
and here you come back to a

1284
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:10,870
point-to-point Association well you yes

1285
01:09:09,670 --> 01:09:12,580
which is which is what we want right

1286
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:14,920
because every point-to-point may I have

1287
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:16,750
a different compression and depending

1288
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:19,359
how far you want to compress thanks etc

1289
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:23,319
so it looks like an idea to be able to

1290
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:25,720
transport a body or compressed with

1291
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:30,100
shake where has the mesh itself is still

1292
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:31,839
six low and I know coop you mention why

1293
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:34,450
Sun but for I know the see assembly

1294
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:37,240
protocol which is the the coop simple

1295
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:39,880
measurement protocol is got and so so I

1296
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:42,189
already see where and how shake could be

1297
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:43,960
useful for managing the devices with

1298
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:46,059
with lower cost by by using sheet to

1299
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:49,540
comprise the CMV messages for instance

1300
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:51,720
so I see it very valuable so that means

1301
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:54,790
for six low that's where it becomes

1302
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,920
quote and quite interesting for us is we

1303
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:58,900
end up with a document explaining how

1304
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:05,080
you will make it so that the next day is

1305
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:06,700
check at which we don't have today so

1306
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,650
once you see that you can decide when

1307
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:12,450
you decompress and that can be at the

1308
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:12,450
edge of the network or the endpoints I

1309
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:18,330
think we are run out of time we have two

1310
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:21,130
more presentations to go Thank You Alan

1311
01:10:18,330 --> 01:10:22,630
so another advantage is effectively what

1312
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,340
I mean the end point I really do mean

1313
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:27,040
the end points like the problem with if

1314
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:28,330
you use shake for IP is that you know

1315
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,010
the first router which goes to the

1316
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:32,410
internet as to speak shake because it

1317
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:34,960
needs to decompress and it might

1318
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:37,809
comprise the whole thing but now with if

1319
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:40,510
you say oh I'm using six low pad for IP

1320
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:41,320
it means that I can really reconfigure I

1321
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:45,130
can rebuild that

1322
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:47,590
six packet where the content is hidden

1323
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:50,770
within UDP to pass through the firewalls

1324
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:52,630
maybe but it's it's Czech and so if you

1325
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:55,530
do that then the compressor is really

1326
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:58,630
the application which is kind of cool

1327
01:10:55,530 --> 01:11:01,630
because you don't have to put state in

1328
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:07,030
the network it's at the endpoint Thank

1329
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:09,219
You Alexander will we see you online

1330
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:16,000
could you join the queue so that we can

1331
01:11:09,219 --> 01:11:18,579
make you the presenter we are going back

1332
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:23,219
to the to the can presentation and then

1333
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:23,219
we can do the asymmetric

1334
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,600
okay

1335
01:11:47,150 --> 01:12:03,559
can you say something now we can't hear

1336
01:11:51,380 --> 01:12:13,849
you so that we can make him that wasn't

1337
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:16,639
her and you can speak there is a

1338
01:12:13,849 --> 01:12:32,119
presentation mode I think you know if

1339
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:35,060
you yeah yeah yes perhaps a bit longer

1340
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:44,719
please yeah I can try to talk later with

1341
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:49,670
Audra yeah but can I switch these lights

1342
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:52,580
oh you can ask Alan will pass this light

1343
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:55,849
for you okay yeah so um hello I'm

1344
01:12:52,580 --> 01:13:01,760
examiner and the author of the six low

1345
01:12:55,849 --> 01:13:03,770
draft and can you switch your slide yeah

1346
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,590
why do we actually want to have IP

1347
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:08,060
version 6 over the canvas because IP

1348
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,020
version 6 is technology in

1349
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:11,090
vendor-independent

1350
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:14,300
we have lots of application layer

1351
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:17,560
protocols like co-op and MQTT and

1352
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,610
whatever are UT protocols we have today

1353
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:22,580
we can have transport layer security

1354
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:25,880
because the campus is actually not

1355
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:28,340
encrypted and we came in routing with

1356
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:31,610
that and we can have even access to the

1357
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:36,530
Internet with small devices yes which is

1358
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:39,980
like this but why do we want campus for

1359
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:42,739
the IP version 6 the campus is actually

1360
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:45,169
it has a broad availability on small

1361
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:49,218
scale MC use for example HP times use

1362
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:52,550
and also a large scale like quarter the

1363
01:13:49,219 --> 01:13:54,440
army application processes it is very

1364
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:57,920
cheap actually it is a very small

1365
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,780
hardware footprint it does not vary just

1366
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,010
small components in addition you need to

1367
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:04,099
the controller

1368
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:06,320
it's a very robust bus it has a simple

1369
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,850
wiring and it's actually widely used

1370
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:13,340
even though we see it we don't see it

1371
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:16,310
today can you go to the next slide one

1372
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:18,710
before there was one in between yeah

1373
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:20,540
the campus is a multi master bus so we

1374
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:22,610
have multiple slaves connected in

1375
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:25,280
parallel to together it has a line

1376
01:14:22,610 --> 01:14:27,940
Technol line topology it is a two wire

1377
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:31,759
bus and we can have up to one Meg about

1378
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:34,489
speed and for the new version with the

1379
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:36,830
flexible data rate we can have up to it

1380
01:14:34,489 --> 01:14:42,309
make about but that heavily depends on

1381
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:42,309
the path length the next slide please

1382
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:49,400
this is what a current frame looks like

1383
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:51,739
we have either 11 bit or 29 bit

1384
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:55,280
identifier but those identifiers are not

1385
01:14:51,739 --> 01:14:57,290
noted verses but they identify frames we

1386
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:01,550
have up to 8 bytes of payload in

1387
01:14:57,290 --> 01:15:06,739
classical can and 64 bytes payloads for

1388
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:09,260
the flexible data rates frames but for

1389
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:13,489
IP version 6 we need note addresses it

1390
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:17,000
was ok please next slide for IP version

1391
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:20,269
6 we need notices so the draft creates a

1392
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,330
node address which is 40 bits wide it

1393
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:25,940
can either be randomly assigned or

1394
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:29,750
statically assigned to the nodes but it

1395
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:31,030
must be unique on the bus next slide

1396
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:34,750
please

1397
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:37,519
but how do we map those nodes

1398
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:40,580
identifiers to the identifiers of the

1399
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:43,429
canvas which has stitched em together so

1400
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:45,290
in the in the higher 14 bits we have the

1401
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:48,140
destination address in the lower 40 bits

1402
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:51,140
worth 2 source address and the most

1403
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:54,050
highest bit is a multicast ik the next

1404
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:56,870
type is for multicast which has set the

1405
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:58,880
multicast flag to 1 and then the

1406
01:15:56,870 --> 01:16:02,540
destination address changes to the

1407
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:06,890
multicast group next like this yeah

1408
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:09,140
to guarantee the uniqueness of of the

1409
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:11,510
node address we introduced the link

1410
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:14,360
layer duplicate address detector which

1411
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:16,850
takes a special kind of can frame

1412
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:18,530
does the Ken frame has an RTR bit which

1413
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:20,900
means remote transmission requests and

1414
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:23,929
such a wrote the remote transmission

1415
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:26,210
requests is sent out with the tentative

1416
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:30,260
address we want as destination address

1417
01:16:26,210 --> 01:16:32,300
and some entropy in source and then we

1418
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:34,520
rate at least 400 milliseconds for

1419
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:37,040
response on the special address we can

1420
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,480
see here this - libraries TDI D address

1421
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,000
and if the source address is the

1422
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,429
tentative address and we get a message

1423
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,960
we know that this this address is

1424
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:47,510
already used and if you don't get a

1425
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,530
message we can guarantee that it's

1426
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:51,680
unique on the bus

1427
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:53,809
and next slide please

1428
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:57,500
because we only have 8 bytes of payload

1429
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:59,570
or 64 we need some fragmentation and

1430
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:04,520
reassembly because the minimal MTO

1431
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:06,679
as we all know is 1280 bytes but the six

1432
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:09,320
low fragmentation is 2 by K the 6 low

1433
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:11,450
fragmentation would already need about

1434
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:17,059
the half of the payload for every frame

1435
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:18,620
so I used a matter fragmentation and

1436
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:20,840
reassembly protocol which is specified

1437
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:23,570
in an iso standard it's the iso TP

1438
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:25,760
protocol it provides us fragmentation

1439
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:29,540
and reassembly and it also has flow

1440
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,950
control but only for unique hosts next

1441
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:33,769
slide please

1442
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:36,650
we also use the 6 low IP header

1443
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:39,650
compression because after a big IP

1444
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:42,920
header for 40 bytes this would take 6

1445
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:46,240
can frames and with the compression if

1446
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:50,420
you're lucky we can go down to 3 frames

1447
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:53,150
next slide please we also introduced the

1448
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:55,970
border translator this border translator

1449
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:58,670
translates the traffic on the canvas to

1450
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:03,470
the Ethernet so it does the reassembling

1451
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:05,570
of the after frames and then it extends

1452
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:07,520
the addresses from load ultras to make

1453
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:10,969
addresses and forwards them to the

1454
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:13,490
Ethernet so the translation is on the

1455
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,770
link layer and devices behind the

1456
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:19,040
Ethernet are or there are also in the

1457
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:21,920
link level in the link local domain next

1458
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:24,019
like this we have all the reference

1459
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:27,800
implementation the 6 low count is

1460
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:30,380
already implemented in the sefar artists

1461
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:33,430
and it's there since version 2 in the

1462
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:38,420
mainline tree there are examples to test

1463
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:47,280
yeah that's okay that so are there any

1464
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:49,020
questions I think we can all discuss

1465
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:51,059
on the mailing list we have one more

1466
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:55,430
presentation to go and we have about 10

1467
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:55,430
minutes thank you

1468
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:22,880
hello commonly from Hawaii today I will

1469
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:26,890
talk about a symmetric ipv6 this is the

1470
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:31,030
second time we presented these drafts

1471
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:34,640
here gives ok were simple remainder

1472
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:38,030
there are there are many steps in a

1473
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:40,370
symmetric ipv6 so for the first one is

1474
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:44,719
defense address lanes end is in your

1475
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:48,559
domain and second we will we will use

1476
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:52,310
our dresses in self domain it have a

1477
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:58,100
common prefix with the lens of some bits

1478
01:19:52,310 --> 01:20:02,090
the bits lanes echoed 128 minus N and

1479
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:08,800
it's in we will route on the shorten the

1480
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:14,230
glasses and mow or we can we can

1481
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:19,070
eliminate the unnecessary header fields

1482
01:20:14,230 --> 01:20:22,759
and at a sort of method is or reuse so

1483
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:29,330
version fields and replace it by 12

1484
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:34,610
including beach okay just it's a simple

1485
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:38,720
simple example the first step of this

1486
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:41,900
are including piece including the

1487
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:45,430
flexible header including octet and is a

1488
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:52,339
modified of ocean fields and tinned

1489
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:56,720
normal ipv6 ipv6 fields but path often

1490
01:20:52,340 --> 01:21:00,770
can be alighted when needed so multiple

1491
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:03,650
it in the draft so you can reduce the

1492
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:06,860
draft and maybe have some comments or

1493
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:10,820
question okay

1494
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:15,110
last time we get some comments for the

1495
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:19,429
relationship to sheik here after that we

1496
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:21,559
read sheik drops and we think she kita

1497
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:26,030
could mechanism to reduce the package

1498
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:30,030
size and of course it can express X

1499
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:35,219
PRIZE as a metric a TV six compression

1500
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:39,210
but we think chic is static that means

1501
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:41,940
after context is it established the

1502
01:21:39,210 --> 01:21:47,070
fields to be compressed to not change

1503
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:50,040
and mmm but as a magical ipv6 offers

1504
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:53,099
dynamic controls of the fields to be

1505
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:59,360
compressed because the cooling bees are

1506
01:21:53,100 --> 01:22:03,120
included in every package so mmm in a

1507
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:05,190
symmetric solutions the short and the

1508
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:09,080
long addresses can be used in the same

1509
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:13,639
package okay

1510
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:13,640
any comments or questions

1511
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:26,799
in order done just in a 6lu is the same

1512
01:22:23,739 --> 01:22:32,650
thing you you cannot have a context and

1513
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:36,880
store information between two packets so

1514
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:38,739
we used the bitmap and The Dispatch and

1515
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:44,050
it back together

1516
01:22:38,739 --> 01:22:48,730
so it's a combination of often and I

1517
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:54,460
read I really you are draft about your

1518
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:59,589
draft so it may it may it may be

1519
01:22:54,460 --> 01:23:03,820
equivalent to a rua t but but we think

1520
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:06,449
we should specify the concrete rules for

1521
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:12,849
the zip for the simplest device

1522
01:23:06,449 --> 01:23:16,530
implementation chic ether coming u k--

1523
01:23:12,849 --> 01:23:16,530
amused or indeed

1524
01:23:29,959 --> 01:23:34,519
okay any any other comments or questions

1525
01:23:36,229 --> 01:23:43,679
so one one question would be that in the

1526
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:46,110
new version of the document there's the

1527
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:50,219
section which compares your solution

1528
01:23:46,110 --> 01:23:52,320
with Sheikh however I perhaps I hope I

1529
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:54,780
haven't missed it I didn't find a

1530
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:59,099
comparison with existing 6lowpan or 6lo

1531
01:23:54,780 --> 01:24:01,768
header compression so how would your

1532
01:23:59,099 --> 01:24:05,159
solution compared with the existing one

1533
01:24:01,769 --> 01:24:07,739
in 6006 open yes the difference between

1534
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:12,659
our solution and it's explosive slogan

1535
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:14,159
is that we we route we route the packet

1536
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:18,949
visit the shore to address there are

1537
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:18,949
Kotori not decompress palpable hop

1538
01:24:19,999 --> 01:24:29,059
because the shorter address is a real

1539
01:24:22,769 --> 01:24:29,059
address not a comprised offers ipv6

1540
01:24:38,519 --> 01:24:54,969
well any any other comments questions so

1541
01:24:48,819 --> 01:25:00,879
I have a question for chairs to do six

1542
01:24:54,969 --> 01:25:06,419
low needs draft of how to defines mmm

1543
01:25:00,879 --> 01:25:11,619
how to defend the compression of ipv6

1544
01:25:06,419 --> 01:25:16,469
graphs in context of six law or any

1545
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:23,139
network six law that's in the Charter

1546
01:25:16,469 --> 01:25:26,919
yes so I think a symmetric ipv6 is an

1547
01:25:23,139 --> 01:25:30,399
alternate alternative solutions and see

1548
01:25:26,919 --> 01:25:35,769
that's how already exists it is a new

1549
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:37,869
one I mean can we ask you to add a

1550
01:25:35,769 --> 01:25:40,539
section on advantages of this over the

1551
01:25:37,869 --> 01:25:42,518
existing six load similar to what you

1552
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:46,268
have done the comparison on she could

1553
01:25:42,519 --> 01:25:48,069
you add the advantages of this or where

1554
01:25:46,269 --> 01:25:50,289
this makes sense over the existing six

1555
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:51,819
low header compression and then we will

1556
01:25:50,289 --> 01:25:55,300
get it reviewed from the workgroup and

1557
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:57,539
see how to progress okay okay thank you

1558
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,539
okay

1559
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:17,619
any other comments yeah so regarding the

1560
01:26:12,809 --> 01:26:19,749
ipv6 over can there has been activity

1561
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:22,598
and questions and comments on the

1562
01:26:19,749 --> 01:26:25,148
mailing list however is there anyone who

1563
01:26:22,599 --> 01:26:27,719
would like to volunteer to review the

1564
01:26:25,149 --> 01:26:27,719
document

1565
01:26:35,630 --> 01:26:47,700
well I just wondered for the ipv6 of our

1566
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:50,460
chicken I thought I'm so over can

1567
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:55,740
six little can think I was just curious

1568
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:57,990
if shake was considered because it makes

1569
01:26:55,740 --> 01:27:00,929
so much sense to use shake their so I

1570
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:03,480
mean before we go deep into oh the bits

1571
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:05,220
of six logos this way or this way there

1572
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:06,929
is one problem this which needs to be

1573
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,100
addressed anyways address the segment's

1574
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:10,980
that's not talking on to the compression

1575
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:14,490
so that can be discussed already but I'd

1576
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:16,290
like to make sure we agreed that we want

1577
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:21,780
to have a six or solution or we want to

1578
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:23,430
have a shake so you should yeah I did

1579
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:26,040
not consider chic because I was not

1580
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:30,650
aware of it so far so but I can have a

1581
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:32,880
look at it it looks very interesting

1582
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:34,469
considering the constraints you have I

1583
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,960
mean it looks really rich mistake to

1584
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:39,990
consider shake yeah thank you yes one

1585
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:43,770
point is that for fragmentation in ipv6

1586
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:46,590
over can may be in addition to

1587
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:48,840
considering eyes OTP perhaps you might

1588
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:51,120
consider the Sheik fragmentation as well

1589
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:52,260
which is really targeted to very

1590
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,570
constrained payloads

1591
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:56,280
like the one you're dealing with you had

1592
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:59,759
a good thing about the isotope is that

1593
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:03,330
it only uses one bite for the fragment

1594
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:05,640
headers and it's it's actually made for

1595
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:08,400
Ken and it's a well known protocol and

1596
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:11,490
there are implementations and it also

1597
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,549
has this flow control and this flow

1598
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:16,139
control can consider some kind of we're

1599
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:18,960
leveling or not they're living its

1600
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:22,890
considering a block size and separation

1601
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:25,380
times where you can better steer your to

1602
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:31,740
demands of your receiver so that you're

1603
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:35,490
not overflowing the receiver and well

1604
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:37,730
one point is is sotp the native

1605
01:28:35,490 --> 01:28:41,250
fragmentation mechanism in income

1606
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:44,790
devices or technology good questions

1607
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:46,229
there is no native fragmentation because

1608
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:50,999
ken is only the

1609
01:28:46,229 --> 01:28:53,969
the physical and data link here but it's

1610
01:28:50,999 --> 01:28:57,539
already there for a long time and so I I

1611
01:28:53,969 --> 01:29:03,269
try to use it because it works actually

1612
01:28:57,539 --> 01:29:06,478
and it is that I think that considering

1613
01:29:03,269 --> 01:29:07,679
well from the ITF we we have from the LP

1614
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:11,159
one working group the Sheik

1615
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:14,840
fragmentation which you might want to

1616
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:18,829
look at to see whether it might also

1617
01:29:14,840 --> 01:29:22,409
fulfill your requirements here it's also

1618
01:29:18,829 --> 01:29:24,808
able to perform fragmentation with flow

1619
01:29:22,409 --> 01:29:26,670
control and fragment recovery there are

1620
01:29:24,809 --> 01:29:28,769
different flavors there and also it's

1621
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:31,619
it's been designed for they know just

1622
01:29:28,769 --> 01:29:35,190
where the MT is really really low really

1623
01:29:31,619 --> 01:29:37,530
small so perhaps it's something in the

1624
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:42,299
lines of what you want here so maybe

1625
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:44,989
considering doesn't be of interest okay

1626
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,989
any other comment
