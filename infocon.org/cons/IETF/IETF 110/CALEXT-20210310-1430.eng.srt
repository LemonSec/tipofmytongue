1
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,039
don't have my microphones picking up the

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
low-flying chopper

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,320
just uh flew overhead

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,559
no anyway i'm doing i'm doing my part

5
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,910
for being in prague

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,960
[Laughter]

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,800
it's too early here it's 1 30 am here

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,160
it's way too early

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,279
yeah or way too late yeah

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,840
all right according to the clock it is

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
time so uh

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,360
welcome everybody to calex in prague

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,760
virtually so of course we always start

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,760
with the noteworld

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,479
which i imagine everyone here has read

16
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,520
by now but this is

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,280
basically the instructions to behave

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
yourself and to

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,240
tell us if you know of anything

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
any intellectual property that affects

21
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,520
this work

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,439
um and otherwise be nice to each other

23
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,200
we're good at that already this is the

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
rough agenda that i've put forward

25
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
for the hour that we have so i don't

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
know how accurate it will stick to these

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
timings there's no particular need to

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,640
stick accurately to this timings better

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
off just spending the time

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,560
on what we want to spend the time on

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,520
does anybody have

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,240
any agenda bashing before we get into it

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
anything else you want to discuss

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
um i'm wondering if francesco and barry

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,840
wants to say something

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
well uh sure i'll say

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,280

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,719
as a.d

40
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,360
and i'm happy to turn over the a.d job

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,400
to francesca for this working group

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
i think you'll enjoy working with

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
francesca

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,680
cool well thank you barry for

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
all right let's let's dig straight in

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,800
then

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,319
uh js calendar there it's in aust 48 at

48
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,120
the moment

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,400
the mapping document's still being

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
worked on and there are specific slides

51
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
so i'm going to switch to those now

52
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,599
and i guess robert neil and mike

53
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,560
whoever wants to speak

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,959
i can speak or neil do you want to

55
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,440
present

56
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,840
you go ahead i'll just jump i need okay

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,239
to

58
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,920
um okay so js calendar um

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,440
we're talking about two rfcs um here uh

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,959
one is the core document

61
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,599
um the cad exchange calendar the next

62
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
the other one is the chase calendar i

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,319
calendar

64
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,280
which is concerned with defining how to

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,680
map

66
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,000
between icon and the ngs calendar

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
next slide please

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,760
so for js calendar djs calendar document

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,519
um um yes brown said we are in oath 48

70
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,480
uh we got ice

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,590
iesg review um

72
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,000
[Music]

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,680
so we are as good as done um

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
uh for the jsk and i calendar document

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
we are uh in a

76
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,640
more early stage um we made sure that um

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,680
that can and i uh cover the

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
i calendar to js calendar mapping um

79
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,519
before

80
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
this session because we came to the

81
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,599
conclusion that um

82
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,799
this is uh having a clean mapping from i

83
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,720
calendar to js calendar

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,320
is is important to us uh for giving

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
js calendar the final goal um and um

86
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,280
we reached consensus on almost all

87
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,360
points already but there are two points

88
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
uh that are still open and so we want to

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
squash them now as as fast as possible

90
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
um yeah for the other direction for js

91
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:35,919
can

92
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
do i clean them i think this will take

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
considerably longer i guess at least

94
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
half a year so

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
we'll have to define new i calendar

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,440
properties and

97
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,560
this is going to be more work but for

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
now the other

99
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,040
the mapping from icalendar is more

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
important to us

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
next slide please

102
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
so uh it says sharing events it's really

103
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,639
about scheduling

104
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,280
um this is one of the two points that

105
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,240
where i have the feeling we do not have

106
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,520
consensus reached

107
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,639
um for js calendar

108
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,919
and i think we should and then whatever

109
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
decision we we come up with now should

110
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:21,840
be

111
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,039
the final goal for js calendar the thing

112
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,280
is

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
while working on the icon and the js

114
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
calendar document

115
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
we um we came to realize that there is

116
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
not necessarily a clean mapping

117
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,880
between i calendar

118
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
the way i can the attendees are defined

119
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
in js calendar

120
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
in js calendar a participant can have

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,320
multiple

122
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
methods um to reach the participant for

123
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,680
scheduling

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
uh requests um whereas

125
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,800
in in in i calendar you have you have

126
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,039
one calendar user address um

127
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,720
which is the value of the property and

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
then optionally an email

129
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,880
parameter that apple introduced a couple

130
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,080
of

131
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,800
a while ago because they are using

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
calendar addresses user addresses that

133
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,320
are not

134
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,319
[Music]

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,000
usable for imit internally um

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
and we now have the the the

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,400
the thing that that we can't clearly

138
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,360
map between these two formats um because

139
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,400
if we

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,120
if we map an i calendar to a js calendar

141
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,319
and then someone

142
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
changes the sent to method

143
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
entries probably uh having them giving

144
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
them more than one entry

145
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
um we won't be able to identify which

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
one to use as the calendar user address

147
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
in i canada this is the one issue the

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,360
other issue is that um

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
in i calendar the can the user address

150
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,319
is used to

151
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,039
to cross-reference between attendees for

152
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,919
example if

153
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,960
you have delegates um in cheers calendar

154
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,440
we have

155
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,199
this we are using participant ids um

156
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,720
to do this which basically

157
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
where we can basically achieve the same

158
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
but it will require us to include for

159
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,360
example

160
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,639
multiple participants uh in

161
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,360
when we send an itip response uh with

162
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
jscanda because

163
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,039
and this this again is a difference to i

164
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,720
calendar because in i calendar

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,520
if you reply as an attendee you only

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
allow to have exactly one attendee in

167
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
the itip response

168
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
in js calendar we will now have to allow

169
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
multiple participants

170
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
so we will have to figure out which one

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
of these is the

172
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,879
attendee and which one did we just

173
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,000
include to

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,319
to have a clean uh mapping to the

175
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,800
delegates for example

176
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,360
um and um

177
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,000
so we think we should address this um

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
and um

179
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
one of the options that we came up with

180
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,720
was to define

181
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
uh calendar user address property in js

182
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,160
calendar

183
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
which uniquely which has a

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,319
clean bi-directional mapping between the

185
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
iq and the property value of an attendee

186
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,440
organizer um and the js calendar

187
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
participant

188
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,639
um but that's one but not necessarily

189
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,240
the only solution to these two

190
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
um gaps that we identified so we are

191
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,919
wondering

192
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,399
probably me you have thoughts on this i

193
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
saw on the mailing list

194
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,279
um probably someone else might share

195
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,000
their opinions

196
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,440
i don't mean this i don't like the idea

197
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
of running this

198
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,040
calendar property

199
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,080
i think uh

200
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,200
we could add a uid property if we

201
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
want uh to be able to have these the

202
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,720
dangly references essentially be able to

203
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,440
say

204
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
it's delegated from this person we're

205
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,000
not going to tell you anything about

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,080
this person in this

207
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
if you know if you know who that your id

208
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,200
results do that you might know who it

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
was delegated from

210
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,080
um that's

211
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,839
i'm not any particularly huge fan of

212
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,160
that anyway because i think it's

213
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,680
weird but um yeah we could have some

214
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
kind of uid

215
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,200
roughly and then we map that uh in some

216
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
way but otherwise i said i think the

217
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
send two

218
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
does map if you if you're mapping for my

219
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
candidate there will only be one value

220
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,880
if if you have multi values well that's

221
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
because you're using features that are

222
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,760
currently available in like calendar so

223
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,519
it's just richer um well not necessarily

224
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,160
right i mean

225
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,760
if we if we get uh and we have already

226
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,160
seen

227
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
calendar events in i calendar from apple

228
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,920
where there is a for us meaningless

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,000
uh uri in the in the property value

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,680
um so if that would be the only send to

231
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
value then

232
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,720
basically but there would be an email

233
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,160
parameter property

234
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,560
then we would have two entries in the

235
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,279
same two

236
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,320
one yeah that's where because because

237
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,279
that email value

238
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,800
is not a it's not an improved

239
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,320
destination so that would just be the

240
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
email property on the js calendar as

241
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
well it would not be in the center

242
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,440
as cyrus made me clear no that

243
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,040
he made that clear yet i got that event

244
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,600
into my calendar or at least i got it to

245
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
where i could display it

246
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,440
because it was sent as an imip

247
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,640
attachment

248
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,079
using the email parameter value

249
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,760
i mean whatever you're saying and that

250
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,839
that was a bug in

251
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,680
no no what he said was a bug was the

252
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,200
format of the of the current user

253
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
address because it's not a it's not

254
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,440
actually a valid uri it's missing the

255
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,399
scheme

256
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
but the point the point is that what was

257
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,160
sent to me

258
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,920
using my my uh thunderbird client

259
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
was uh an event with a currently user

260
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
address it was a

261
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,160
in parentheses invalid uri that's not a

262
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,959
mail to

263
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,440
and he used the email parameter value as

264
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,800
the destination of the

265
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,920
of the imit message there was no there

266
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
was no

267
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
uh attendee in there that that

268
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,440
referenced me with a counter user

269
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,240
address of only of a mail to

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,480
so apple's practice at the moment is to

271
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
send you something where the email

272
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,200
parameter is

273
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,279
the actual imip address you're using

274
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,800
ah and i don't that's not what the

275
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,320
actual spec says

276
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,680
it's not what the author of this book

277
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
says and if that's what's happening then

278
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,160
there's

279
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,279
clearly yeah

280
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,839
rather than something to you know try to

281
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,560
bend ourselves and knots to support i i

282
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
agree with neil on this one i think

283
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
cyrus made it clear that the email

284
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
parameter was basically for apple

285
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,680
internal use and the fact that it

286
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
escaped into the wild was a mistake

287
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
no no he said it's a useful thing but it

288
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
it the the point is its definition is

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
exactly the same as

290
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,200
the email property in js calendar

291
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
already is which is this is an email

292
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,480
address if you would like to contact

293
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,160
this person and send them an email it is

294
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,240
not the same as this is where you send

295
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,040
scheduling messages that is what the

296
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,000
send to for

297
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,920
which can be a mail to param which may

298
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
even be the same email address

299
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,920
but it's it's for a different context

300
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,800
and the same as

301
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
what the calendar address is if you use

302
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
a mail to uri

303
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,000
there i don't that's not

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,639
that's not how the discussions went at

305
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,320
the time this is this isn't something

306
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
that

307
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,079
whatever his his recollection of this is

308
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,639
at the time it happened

309
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,959
there was a lot of of pushback from

310
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,000
other people saying why have you

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
suddenly switched to using this email

312
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
uh parameter and and given us a value

313
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
that we can't use

314
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
and and it was more of a reaction from

315
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,040
will freighter but that that was the

316
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
basically thing was well that's the way

317
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,800
it has to be and and they explained why

318
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
sort of but it wasn't something that

319
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,959
just escaped into the wild it's what

320
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,839
they did

321
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,200
and we had to follow well yeah those two

322
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
ideas shouldn't be

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
appearing on the attendees when they go

324
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
out on the wire they should just be

325
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,720
internally within apple and then get

326
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,399
translated at the edge so the question

327
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
is whether they are still sending those

328
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,600
or whether that was a bug where they

329
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
were temporarily not that example

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,760
that example is what i sent about three

331
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,120
weeks ago

332
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,839
yeah right i generated that with my my

333
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,720
mac

334
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,040
uh at the time it wasn't something from

335
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,480
the package using which calendar server

336
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
uh probably apples

337
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,519
but running like just there the open

338
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,800
source one running

339
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
on no i'm using no clue no no i used

340
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,399
using my mac

341
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,760
with my my apple calendar on it and i

342
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,199
created an event in in apple's ical

343
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,160
and and then you'll still have added me

344
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
i'm assuming

345
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,959
yes the icloud server icloud server

346
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,760
which is not the same

347
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
tools yeah as that's a different server

348
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,120
code base entirely

349
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,639
as in my understanding um that's not

350
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,560
true

351
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
to the open source apple calendar server

352
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,839
which is the open source one which is

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,519
what's running

354
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,920
the open source no longer is no longer

355
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,519
in fact they completely written

356
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
internally i think they

357
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,880
um so no that that that example was

358
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
generated

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,279
at the time i sent the message

360
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,160
we need to interpret with icloud

361
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
that's the current state of affairs not

362
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,839
not something that comes out of anything

363
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,079
else

364
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
in fact it doesn't even correspond to

365
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
cyrus's examples

366
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,160
um yeah i mean try to make compatibility

367
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,639
with

368
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,320
something that's not following existing

369
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,680
specs is always

370
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,079
fun but okay um we can

371
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,320
try and find more examples of that and

372
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
see what's going on

373
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,040
and um

374
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,399
yeah what should be happening is yes

375
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,680
though

376
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,320
anything seen externally the calendar

377
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,680
address

378
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
is this is the ib value is there's the

379
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
male 2 value which um

380
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,560
i i mean i guess that good yeah

381
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
well i i was just thinking i guess

382
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
perhaps what you would with your test

383
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,079
what you were seeing was not an external

384
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,399
thing you were it was because it was not

385
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,079
the result of the

386
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,360
it message being sent you were exporting

387
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,839
the copy of the event from your cal dev

388
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,279
no is that right i i

389
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,240
no no i exported i sent it to myself via

390
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,680
an email address because

391
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,199
the one of the problems i've always had

392
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
with with looking at at the

393
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,959
the internal form of apple's um

394
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,680
events is there's no easy export from

395
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,639
from ical

396
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,800
so what i do is i use all my other email

397
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,440
addresses as a as an attendee

398
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,920
so i sent it to one of my other email

399
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,880
addresses

400
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,639
and that and then i picked that up from

401
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
thunderbird so yeah it's going i'm it

402
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,160
all right perhaps we can give us

403
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,360
instructions to try and

404
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
reproduce somewhere and i also i also

405
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
said i

406
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,320
want to um to to

407
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
ken around the same time because there

408
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,600
was i was trying to

409
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,639
to um verify that this invalid uh urn

410
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,320
value that they were using you the

411
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,079
in the in the county user address

412
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,079
actually was um

413
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,639
what they were sending i don't know

414
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,759
whether we

415
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,959
you looked at that but it's pretty easy

416
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,360
to

417
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,560
to uh um verify it

418
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
um by the way um i now also recall that

419
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,320
actually the the email parameter um

420
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,359
was what was not necessarily should be

421
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,000
used for

422
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
for imip i got that wrong before um but

423
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,359
nevertheless

424
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,319
and even irrespective i think of of the

425
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,079
specific apple example

426
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,119
um we want the

427
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,280
js calendar icon and the rfc to be a

428
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,160
standard

429
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,559
um and we wanted it and it's so

430
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,319
important to get scheduling

431
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,679
right in both formats to interrupt um

432
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,320
that we need to define a standard way

433
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,679
how a participant

434
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,520
should map to an attendee including

435
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,799
their property value

436
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,160
at the moment we have two entries

437
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
in the in the send to um

438
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,919
we don't want clients to come up with

439
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,880
different

440
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
different mappings because then it

441
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
breaks all apart as long as

442
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,720
i calendar is still uh is still around

443
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
it i guess it will be for a long time

444
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,400
yeah so so we need

445
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
we need to define some standard mapping

446
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
and

447
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
i think that's that's straightforward if

448
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
there's an imp value use that one as

449
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,240
the the calendar value in in our

450
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,520
calendar because that's likely to be the

451
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,400
one they understand

452
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
if not um pick any one because no one's

453
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
gonna understand anything else

454
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,520
like you you can't

455
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
you can't end up with this from going

456
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,960
from my calendar to just calendar so

457
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,320
you're starting from a richard just

458
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,280
calendar one

459
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
and coming back yes correct but you

460
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,160
might change the change calendar and and

461
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,000
change yeah so yeah so i

462
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
like if there are multiple almost

463
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,120
certainly yes

464
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,720
on the i move one if there's an iron

465
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
with one in there is the one that should

466
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,960
go into the eye counter is the value

467
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
just take that yeah and if everyone

468
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
agrees that's

469
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,160
that's the same decision assuming that

470
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,840
there is at least one

471
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,799
mailto uri in the send to of course or

472
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,039
one eyelid method um

473
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,840
um i'm just saying that if we would have

474
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
a specific

475
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,679
one specific property b that uid

476
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,559
apparently use

477
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,200
address or whatever it would be totally

478
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,840
clear which one to use

479
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,720
all right i'm just going to share a

480
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
thing because this is this will make it

481
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
um oh can i just raise a

482
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
quick point here about whether this

483
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
should be appearing or not appearing

484
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,320
cyrus in his in his first message about

485
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,760
the email parameter

486
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,600
says the server actually does write the

487
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,960
email parameter he

488
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,679
actually implies that this goes out and

489
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,360
the in the message that's sent out

490
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,400
yeah the email parameter does yeah well

491
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,880
the email

492
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,360
the the value that's in there the only

493
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,640
reason for the email prompt is because

494
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
the value isn't

495
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
isn't a mail too

496
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
this is an email that i just sent myself

497
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,240
from icloud

498
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,960
uh right now logging into the icloud web

499
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,240
interface and sending it

500
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,679
and you can see that the attendee has a

501
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,840
um slash

502
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,440
ss not you proper uri and the organizer

503
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
has a mail to address

504
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,960
at imep.me.com um with a matching yes

505
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,960
because the only one that

506
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
you would be sending back to is the

507
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,799
organizer obviously

508
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,440
yes which is which is yeah and mail to

509
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,559
address

510
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,039
um and then the attendee is me so i see

511
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,080
rubbish in

512
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,720
like non-understandable things in these

513
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,480
other fields

514
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,159
but the only ones that i need to care

515
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,400
about are the attendee that is me

516
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,200
and the organizer

517
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,760
yeah so apart from the fact that those

518
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,240
were

519
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
both mapped to a single uh ascend to

520
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,280
with a single

521
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
component in the organizer's case it

522
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
would be a imip male 2

523
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,919
and in the attendee case it would be an

524
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:02,480
other

525
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,520
here's a uri we don't know how you would

526
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,919
without to this that would come out

527
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,039
clearly in round trip

528
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,158
back again as well

529
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,480
cool okay so but if you add an imid now

530
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,039
to the

531
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,080
gs participant um

532
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
we would um convert it back to an icon

533
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
the attendee with a different

534
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
value than the one with the rubbish um

535
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,960
and i

536
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
you're really allowed to do as an

537
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
attendee you're just sending

538
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,080
back to the organizer like if you're

539
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
if you're sending this back by calendar

540
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,678
like that

541
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,880
like yeah i i i

542
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,640
think that's that's the thing

543
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,039
yeah i mean

544
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
you'll only include your own attendee

545
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,240
and the organizer in your

546
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,240
yeah but but i meant if you was the

547
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,360
attendee

548
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
you would include your own attendee when

549
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,760
replying so

550
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,760
so you need to yeah but your your own

551
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,280
attendee doesn't have that apple stuff

552
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,559
in it under the other attendees have

553
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,039
that apple stuff in it

554
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,240
my attendee had that stuff in it you're

555
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,960
the one you're sending to your

556
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
thunderbird attendee or only your apple

557
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,600
attendee

558
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
because you're the apple attender who's

559
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,039
you on apple

560
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,400
thunderbird doesn't care what their

561
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
address is oh i see what you're saying

562
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,159
sorry

563
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
yes yeah yeah yeah

564
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,039
so in action

565
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,039
you can't you can't edit them and you

566
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,679
can't send to them

567
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,840
but um

568
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,679
so neil can you repeat what would you

569
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,039
think the mapping should be so i can

570
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,799
capture it for the minutes um

571
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,880
yes so you're always mapping the

572
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,960
value to the calendar address value

573
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,080
to uh the send to property

574
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,280
and if it's um uh

575
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,400
a male 2 uri then we presume that's an

576
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,039
imip

577
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,039
and so that maps the iomit and if it's

578
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,400
just random other

579
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,520
uri then it maps just to other

580
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,240
uh as the the type in in the center

581
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,880
because

582
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,120
you know there is no way you know how to

583
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,639
reach that it's essentially in a page

584
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,600
right and we also need to define that

585
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,039
using js calendar with itip one is not

586
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:51,600
allowed

587
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,719
to change descent to of the participant

588
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,840
is replying

589
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
um

590
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,000
well if they're sending back js calendar

591
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
they could but that

592
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,880
like i i think saying i tip with js

593
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,240
calendars is

594
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,559
is too broad thing it's um

595
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,480
uh there's kind of two different

596
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,559
scenarios here you you could be

597
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,159
just um doing it with i calendar which

598
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:26,400
is

599
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,679
is more likely and you're doing js

600
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,640
calendar

601
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,880
translation just from the server down to

602
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,400
um

603
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,000
to to a client that's

604
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,840
fine or sorry it's very light here and

605
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,240
i'm

606
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,279
not very good um

607
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,080
yeah i get what you mean so it's about

608
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
using js calendar

609
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,240
as a payload in it that's what i mean

610
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,039
yes

611
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,480
yeah which is is presumably

612
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,520
the aim of all this that yeah there's a

613
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,720
there's an upgrade goal here and the

614
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,159
whole point of the multi of century

615
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,200
being multi-value

616
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,480
um is being able to uh one of the ways

617
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,679
of being able to get us

618
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,120
past just having um imip

619
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,200
everywhere and and be able to get

620
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
something a bit better

621
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,679
um but

622
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,720
if you're telling me you've got still

623
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
believe i tip underneath it because i

624
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
tip is not the transport mechanism it's

625
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,840
the it's

626
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
it's simply the way you respond

627
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,400
i agree um

628
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,840
we're eating a lot a lot of time here

629
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,279
and this might be better done on

630
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,400
main list where we can um like

631
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
write in more detail rather um

632
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,200
okay here they

633
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
but yeah i mean okay i i i going back to

634
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,840
the original question on this i

635
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,919
stick by i think there is a good

636
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,039
translation we don't need to add an

637
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,120
extra property

638
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,360
yeah that's fair enough i think the only

639
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
point that we

640
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,960
that we need to get it for js calendar

641
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,320
is that

642
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,360
we know we know that it of all the

643
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,720
consequences for the

644
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
remaining mapping and i tip stuff

645
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,159
we don't need to wait for all these rfcs

646
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,200
but we need to

647
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
be sure that we found the same same

648
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,880
approach that's all

649
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,520
yeah yeah let's confirm on the main list

650
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,360
like put the scenarios there but i i

651
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,720
think

652
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,279
just a quick quick point about this that

653
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,799
um was touched on

654
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,159
is the the values of the delegated two

655
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,520
from sent by and all the rest the sent

656
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
by actually was one of the things which

657
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,120
triggered me off into doing this because

658
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,640
on our spam

659
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,720
uh calls we've been talking about these

660
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
scenarios that have occurred

661
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,400
um with people who send stuff on behalf

662
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
of somebody else and and they're doing

663
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,640
that

664
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,000
in in a uh an environment where they

665
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
have multiple email domains because it

666
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,880
was a merged

667
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,559
um company and and then of course you

668
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,159
factor in dkim and everything goes to

669
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,360
hell

670
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,440
and um so send by became a um

671
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,880
a real issue so we need to ensure that

672
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,919
those parameters work and i think

673
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,799
sent by you know having a participant id

674
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,720
is actually a more complicated way of

675
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
dealing with it if we can fix

676
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
on what actually the calendar user

677
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,600
address is

678
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
then that could be the value that's sent

679
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,919
by as it is in i calendar

680
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,120
and you don't need to add extra

681
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,799
participants to um

682
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,200
i mean

683
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
i have to give i thought senpai was just

684
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,440
the email address of the person

685
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,799
that sent it so not i have to go check

686
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,360
well yeah it but it sort of has the same

687
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,000
issues as

688
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,720
delegated to and from you you delegate

689
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,520
two

690
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,399
you delegate to an imip um you know an

691
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,480
email address a mail to

692
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,919
and at some future point the that that

693
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,600
message appears with that with an

694
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
attendee um

695
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,799
with a delegated from and a an a and a

696
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,799
a and a mail to value

697
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,679
so they're all they all have some of the

698
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,679
same

699
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,679
uh just as a quick note uh i think we

700
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,720
are already

701
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,200
almost at half an hour um yeah we're

702
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,399
well over time we should

703
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,720
we should move on uh was there anything

704
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,760
else in the slides here

705
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,880
three more slides yeah but it this is

706
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
the only other interesting thing so um

707
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,000
as for mapping between jsk and the icon

708
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,039
of attendees

709
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,000
we also found

710
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,120
a few gaps for recurring events um one

711
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,760
is with our

712
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,120
r dates um where uh in icon and it's

713
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,360
clear that an rdate is an r date in

714
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,880
addition to whatever the

715
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
artworks are producing um in js canada

716
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,279
it is

717
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,640
not so uh this might come into play when

718
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,080
changing the r rule

719
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,159
firstly because if you change the

720
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,000
recurrence rule you will have to figure

721
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,640
out

722
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,640
if the what state is in order and

723
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,960
what really could go into the recurrence

724
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,840
rule

725
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,440
um but it also means that

726
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
if the intention was of an rdate

727
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,279
regardless of the recurrency word you

728
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,000
have to

729
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,279
figure out we can't currently tell uh if

730
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,240
we should preserve these as our dates

731
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,760
when in our routine this is

732
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,440
i mean you'll change the overall that's

733
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,279
just from the client to

734
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,880
deal with no i don't think there's an

735
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,320
issue

736
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,080
i mean two things here firstly our date

737
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,919
could coincide with

738
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,760
the recurrence rule already in icalendar

739
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,200
there's nothing that says it has to be a

740
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,080
date that

741
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
doesn't get generated by the rule um

742
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,039
yeah uh and the the but the other

743
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,879
uh the other thing is just the um

744
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,340
uh um

745
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,750
[Music]

746
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,080
yeah so the specific case neil that i

747
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,159
think we'd need to consider here

748
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,919
is suppose that you have a meeting that

749
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
occurs you know

750
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,760
on the first monday of every month and

751
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,279
then you explicitly say and we're

752
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,200
definitely going to meet on the

753
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,720
third tuesday in this month because this

754
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
is an important date to meet

755
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,480
and you add that as an r date in the

756
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
system and maybe even put some overrides

757
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,279
into it

758
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,880
and then you change the rule say

759
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,840
actually we're just going to make this

760
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,200
meeting this the third tuesday of the

761
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,600
month

762
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,840
every time and then you go actually no

763
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,360
we're going to change it back

764
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,039
does that recurrence disappear because

765
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,360
it was it existed

766
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,440
or not how do you how do you know which

767
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,039
recurrence overrides to remove

768
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,600
um i mean that's another client and

769
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,880
that's the same whether you're

770
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,480
doing without account or js calendar

771
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,919
like i i

772
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,080
don't really think this yeah actually it

773
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,039
doesn't express

774
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,320
a lot of semantic intent here

775
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,799
if it's an override then then it's an

776
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,080
override and you're right because it

777
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,559
would

778
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,880
in i calendar it would already exist as

779
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
a separate

780
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,480
full instance of the calendar event and

781
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,840
so it would be retained even if you

782
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,960
change the rules so

783
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,840
as soon as you override anything you

784
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,519
you're immediately instantiating it as a

785
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,880
full recurrence

786
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,960
yes but i guess the the idea is if you

787
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,640
create a blank

788
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,399
uh date um so it's a recurrence that has

789
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:24,960
nothing

790
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,519
but there's something happening at this

791
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,480
date

792
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,840
then does that get retained when you

793
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,200
change the rule and i think the answer

794
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,480
is yes you always retain them

795
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,159
i mean it's entirely up to the client

796
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,240
because the client is changing the

797
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,440
overall and so

798
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,960
what it should do with the rest of the

799
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,559
event is yeah going to be

800
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,039
dependent on the context and i think

801
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,200
that's the concern of the spec at all

802
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,240
yep it's okay whether you tagged them

803
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,519
with something saying that this was

804
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,720
explicitly

805
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
created or not but i guess yeah yep

806
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,159
cool it's much much less um and the

807
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,760
other thing i think this was already

808
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,679
discussed on the on the mailing list

809
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,320
it's about

810
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,360
uh standalone um events i

811
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,159
saw a standalone recurrence for

812
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:10,799
instances

813
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,240
of an event on the previous slide um

814
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,519
so the question was there that with the

815
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,399
standalone

816
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,200
uh standard no recurrence instance you

817
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,640
don't know the time zone

818
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,240
of the of the main event um which means

819
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,799
you also don't have the for i calendar

820
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,960
the necessary time zone

821
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,399
um the boss of the main event um and

822
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,080
which makes up the complete value of the

823
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,120
recurrence id

824
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,240
in i calendar so the thought was that

825
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,159
to add a recurrence id time zone

826
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,679
property which

827
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,159
only is allowed to be set if the event

828
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,320
has a recurrence id

829
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,320
um so if it's if it's really a

830
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,600
recurrence instance

831
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,200
yeah yeah i i think we could do this

832
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,519
i think the property should be um

833
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,720
defined in the

834
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,240
icon of js kind of the translation

835
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,600
document because the only time you would

836
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,159
use it

837
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,399
is when translating i calendar into js

838
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,320
calendar to ensure that can be round

839
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,200
tripped

840
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,200
um if you receive

841
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,840
the recurrence id is not an opaque

842
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,880
object it's a date

843
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
time and it needs to be it needs to be

844
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,880
possible to convert that date time

845
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,600
into things like utc it's indexed and

846
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,200
it's searched for

847
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,440
it it takes part in all sorts of things

848
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,120
when you're doing time range searches

849
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,519
we can't just treat it as an opaque

850
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,360
object so to convert it correctly and

851
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,320
use it correctly

852
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,200
we have to have its time zone that that

853
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,320
was the point where

854
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,240
where things and so even if you don't

855
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,919
have the master event

856
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,320
you don't you have no idea whether the

857
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,480
what what the real uh

858
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,039
time of that recurrence id is so you

859
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,240
can't do things like

860
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,960
check to see whether this falls inside

861
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,720
the time range even though the

862
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,080
thing has been overridden so it's

863
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,240
outside the time range which is part of

864
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,279
of the searches we do that's that was

865
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,159
the issue

866
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,918
and i i think we should just have this

867
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,199
and we put in there

868
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,119
every time you have a standalone

869
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,679
override uh instance of an event you add

870
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,119
a recurrence id you know

871
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,239
time zone to it it's simple and it it

872
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,280
allows us to do

873
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,079
what we're doing now

874
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,719
would you make it you only include it if

875
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,159
it's different to the actual time zone

876
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,040
so you only because you're only

877
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
i would when it actually you if in

878
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,719
theory you could i'd be inclined to say

879
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,239
just put it in any way because people

880
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,719
will

881
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,520
will miss it if they don't you know but

882
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,480
yes you could

883
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,000
you could optimize a little bit by not

884
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,399
having it

885
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,399
i guess the question here is do you just

886
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,000
have a property called time zone

887
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,520
in the recurrence in that case

888
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,879
we already have that that's the issue we

889
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,560
have that is that that's yeah yeah we

890
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,280
already have that

891
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,520
in the issues if that doesn't match the

892
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,040
time zone of the master event if it does

893
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,480
match the times the last event then

894
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,760
we don't get it and you could call it

895
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
the master time zone

896
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,400
yeah we can't tell you times that's fine

897
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,640
um

898
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,440
i'm too tired to give my opinion on this

899
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,040
right now i like

900
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,320
that sounds probably okay if yeah

901
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,400
so maybe i missed the problem but um

902
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,160
do we have a time zone into the into any

903
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,079
single occurrence or is that not

904
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,839
specified yet

905
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,000
the issue turns up because the

906
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,359
recurrence ids are

907
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,320
date time objects like like there's a

908
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,520
whole bunch of date time

909
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,240
things there values as dt star dt ends

910
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,599
but the recurrence ids are

911
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,640
time zone uh time time yeah at

912
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,320
a real time and when you do time range

913
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,599
searches you you're actually searching

914
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,920
for recurrence ids as well as all the dt

915
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,560
starts and things because

916
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,400
the the what where the problem occurs

917
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,640
here is you might have you might be

918
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,200
invited

919
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240
to a single instance of of a

920
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,839
an event and the recur and that the time

921
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,680
zone of that instance might have been

922
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,640
shifted

923
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,960
so that you know you express the dt

924
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,400
start in it you know you say you got a

925
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,119
meetings in

926
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,599
in new york and you're using american

927
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,040
new york as your time zone for the

928
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,640
master event and then oh we'll have one

929
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,000
meeting in london

930
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,240
and you change the time zones and the dt

931
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,040
start but

932
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,320
you can't without in i calendar you can

933
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
you you have the time zone as explicitly

934
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,320
set on the recurrence id

935
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,040
so you don't that's not a problem in js

936
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,480
calendar

937
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
there isn't a an explicit time zone id

938
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,960
for the recurrence id

939
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
it's just the recurrence id of the start

940
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
location and the end location

941
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,720
so we need a third time zone id

942
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,160
which is the request we just delay this

943
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,000
until tc 39's date time

944
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,520
is done then we'll have date times that

945
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,359
have time zones in them and we could

946
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:57,760
yeah

947
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,280
no no no no no

948
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,560
um the yeah

949
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,160
i guess my why i'm a bit puzzled is you

950
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,760
you said you want the time zone for date

951
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,480
for querying but if you aren't invited

952
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,680
to the master you're only inviting this

953
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,480
recurrence id

954
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,200
why i i would wouldn't expect the query

955
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,000
to look at

956
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,599
the time range queries look at the

957
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,359
recurrence id at all just look at the

958
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,119
start times of the particular instances

959
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,200
do you do queries on these things to see

960
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,640
whether uh

961
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
an instance of the event has been moved

962
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,760
outside of the time

963
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,119
maybe you're saying what meetings have i

964
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,800
got this week and

965
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,960
then yeah it's flag this has been moved

966
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,119
into the into the following week

967
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,480
but it would it would never even show up

968
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,440
in in the in the response to the query

969
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,200
so the clients can't

970
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,800
notify you that by the way this

971
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,760
meeting's been moved

972
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,480
without the old copy that was part of

973
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:58,960
one of

974
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,119
one of the reasons for searching on time

975
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,040
zone on recurrence ids is there's a

976
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,000
whole bunch of reasons

977
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,040
why why the time range query has got all

978
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,440
that

979
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,200
complication all right we've only got 20

980
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,560
minutes left for everything so i think

981
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,599
this one's going to have to go to the

982
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:12,720
list as well

983
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,920
yeah it's clearly clearly not

984
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,000
definite then yep i tip and then

985
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,160
next steps will go to the list yes

986
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,640
exactly

987
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,520
cool all right thank you let's let's

988
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
plow on

989
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
um back at these slides the next thing

990
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,560
was the alarm extensions which is this

991
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,119
one here

992
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,200
ken yeah not much to say about this

993
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,760
uh real quick uh next slider let's go

994
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,880
through the changes since

995
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,079
the last itf um

996
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,280
we found out that the uh alternate

997
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,160
extensible quote extensible syntax for

998
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,760
defining the alarms wasn't quite as

999
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,520
extensible as we thought so

1000
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,880
that was fixed um following

1001
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,640
the changes in the event pub spec

1002
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,800
we had removed the structure location

1003
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
property and replaced that with

1004
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,960
uh the location sub-component for

1005
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,920
proximity

1006
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,359
alarms and due to some confusion during

1007
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:15,680
the

1008
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,960
iesg reviews i recognized and

1009
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,480
hopefully clarified the process of

1010
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,079
snoozing alarm

1011
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,000
and added an example showing

1012
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,079
what pro what components are getting

1013
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,400
added what properties are being changed

1014
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,320
um after all it was done it is now in

1015

1016
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,760
we are done um thanks to cyrus for

1017
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,440

1018
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,599

thanks to barry for

1021
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,599
uh helping me get two revisions posted

1022
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,200
during the blackout period to move this

1023
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,680
thing along

1024
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,280
awesome

1025
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,400
all right next slide was event pub

1026
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,880
um there's questions from expert review

1027
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
and a discuss

1028
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,440
from ben kerdick the one

1029
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
question i have on this one is am i

1030
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,680
supposed to

1031
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,800
what do i do about the the um the avian

1032
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
f for one thing because

1033
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,440
uh the tide seems to have shifted do i

1034
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,000
put it

1035
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,280
back um

1036
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,560
to the 5545 format

1037
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,839
um does it matter um

1038
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,720
and do i and should i resubmit with a

1039
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,839
new version

1040
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,959
well i would say you can resubmit

1041
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,240
and what about the abn f do i mean what

1042
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,560
be

1043
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,119
somebody who uses the stuff i'm not too

1044
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,000
concerned whether

1045
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,359
it matches the 5545 um

1046
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,920
format i'm more concerned that it that

1047
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,680
it's um

1048
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,279
understandable and you can

1049
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,079
barry what do you think yeah as the one

1050
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:08,400
who

1051
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,760
pushed that change and then

1052
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,000
had to agree that um this isn't the

1053
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,920
right time to do the change

1054
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,440
um i'm of a mixed mind on this document

1055
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,160
because it's a

1056
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,800
pretty small amount of abnf so if you

1057
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,920
want to leave it

1058
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,520
with the changed version that's fine

1059
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,200
yeah on the other hand the only calendar

1060
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,960
related one that's different from the

1061
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,319
five five four five

1062
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,160
syntax so i i'm happy either way uh

1063
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,760
like i said i was the one who pushed the

1064
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,160
change and uh i've been convinced that

1065
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,040
this is the wrong

1066
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,280
place and time to do it so uh your

1067
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,839
judgment on this

1068
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,480
let me take a look again and and maybe

1069
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,520
uh

1070
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,040
i can quickly come up with the

1071
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,480
because there were some there were some

1072
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,079
bugs in it originally anyway

1073
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,839
um but let me see if i can come up with

1074
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,400
a more five five four five

1075
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,359
um i i actually so prefer the form we

1076
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,160
ended up with

1077
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,560
so so do i which is why i was pushing it

1078
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,480
and like i said believe that in this

1079
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,880
document that's fine because it's

1080
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,760
um it's not a lot of abnf but when we

1081
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,480
tried to

1082
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,520
do that in the um in the other document

1083
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,200
where there was a lot more abnf

1084
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,319
involved it just got out of hand and um

1085
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,599
we decided it was

1086
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,720
a bad idea so i'm okay with any changes

1087
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,440
in this one

1088
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,359
all right maybe maybe i'll leave it i'll

1089
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,560
i'll re-post with the

1090
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,440
change i agree i agree that the the new

1091
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,240
abm enough

1092
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,520
is certainly preferable but having as

1093
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,720
barry said having gone through this with

1094
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,760
vl arms

1095
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,520
i'll make it a task for myself to look

1096
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,280
what you've got mike and make sure that

1097
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,440
it actually does what we think it does

1098
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,119
because for the longest time we thought

1099
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,640
that the v alarm

1100
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,400
syntax that cyrus had come up with was

1101
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,319
actually extensible and it was not

1102
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,000
so yeah i'll review what you've got to

1103
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,920
make sure it's not doing something

1104
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,200
strange

1105
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,640
okay that'd be helpful cool and they

1106
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,520
discussed from

1107
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,760
ben kerdick is is everything resolved

1108
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,280
there do we need to keep working on that

1109
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,760
what was ben's disgust do you recall do

1110
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,000
you have it in front of you

1111
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,839
uh let me just pull up the email thread

1112
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,119
again here

1113
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,680
so eight days ago was um

1114
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,520
question was twofold and particularly

1115
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,800
clement's equivalent we should mention

1116
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,920
that in the document in order to

1117
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,560
reassure

1118
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,920
readers there are no hidden changes um

1119
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,280
have we validated it's already

1120
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,520
equivalent overarching considerations we

1121
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,960
shouldn't put false statements

1122
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,720
in the document and that's the that's

1123
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,640
all about questions

1124
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,640
um that was a referendum

1125
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,800
yep so i i think yeah sorry no that is

1126
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,760
three alum

1127
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,440
yes you're right i searched for event

1128
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,400
pub extensions but that was the alarm

1129
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,319
says ken as well so that that's a sort

1130
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,839
of clue

1131
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,839
yep oh good

1132
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,280
all right are we done with event pub i

1133
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,760
think so

1134
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,800
ical relations that's just waiting for

1135
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,280
me to

1136
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,119
press submit i believe there's nothing

1137
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,880
left to do

1138
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,520
um on that other than the question of do

1139
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,680
we need to add js calendar mappings for

1140
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,800
that

1141
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,560
will that go in the js calendar mapping

1142
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,799
dock

1143
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,640
do we need to add anything too my

1144
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,000
recollection is i think they're

1145
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
partially there so maybe it would just

1146
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,440
make sense to make sure they're all

1147
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,000
there

1148
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,920
um this would be easier to

1149
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,520
then say and it's just a matter of

1150
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,319
adding values essentially

1151
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,640
yeah at some point we're going to have

1152
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,359
to add a

1153
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:01,040
js calendar section to calendar changes

1154
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,839
to say here's what happens with js

1155
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
calendar

1156
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,400
cool all right um so

1157
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,160
what do we want to do for this mic

1158
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,440
should you and i just

1159
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,520
chat about what's involved there do you

1160
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,720
want to look at at

1161
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,240
js calendar do you want someone else to

1162
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,480
look at i'll have a quick look at js

1163
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,520
calendar and see where

1164
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,960
where we are in relation to that um

1165
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,560
and yeah we can do it over email

1166
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,839
cool

1167
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,680
all right series

1168
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,520
these were the actions we had last time

1169
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,599
for it

1170
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,880
um i did add them to ical for jay

1171
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,400
at least my my version i i have and i i

1172
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,359
i once it's a little further on i'll

1173
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:53,760
i'll

1174
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,200
uh try to get that into

1175
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,560
the then ben fortuna's version

1176
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,960
and i think i updated the draft didn't i

1177
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:15,359
yeah probably

1178
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,560
i had to read through this document

1179
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,720
today i have quite a lot of

1180
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,280
concerns and things i will talk about it

1181
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,400
but i don't think we've got

1182
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,119
time here calculates probably a better

1183
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,800
place to do

1184
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,920
so we're still quite early stage right

1185
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,240
all right so we discussed this at cal

1186
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,759
connect next cal connect then

1187
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,720
yes we can add it too

1188
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,319
so the disc when is cal connect

1189
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,400
happening

1190
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,200
the month second week of april about a

1191
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,480
month

1192
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,440
okay so after that discussion we will be

1193
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,480
able to

1194
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,480
decide whether it's a working group last

1195
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,319
goal or not

1196
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:11,839
yeah okay

1197
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,598
all right um server side subscriptions

1198
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,599
so it was going to try and sync up to

1199
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,839
what apple have deployed

1200
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,760
yeah i don't think we've got any further

1201
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,160
with this

1202
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,839
cool

1203
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,520
subscription upgrade and i was going to

1204
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,200
do a working group last call on that and

1205
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,640
i suspect

1206
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,839
that i should just do that

1207
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,280
so it looks like yeah the last series

1208
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,720
draft was posted

1209
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,200
in october last year so you haven't done

1210
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,040
a new draft since then

1211
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,400
okay last meeting

1212
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,640
subscription upgrade you did do a new

1213
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,599
draft

1214
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,839
um

1215
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,839
just a few weeks ago yes was posted in

1216
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
february

1217
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:35,839
all right um

1218
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,079
so i guess i should do a working group

1219
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,760
last call on that

1220
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,720
that that's what we expected to do at

1221
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,359
this point so i'll do that

1222
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:46,880
straight after well not immediately

1223
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,640
after this meeting but this week

1224
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:02,160
and finally v-pole

1225
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,240
i think um probably still stands there

1226
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,400
as it is

1227
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,480
um yeah i am i can't remember where i

1228
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,599
whether i resubmitted

1229
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,839
um

1230
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,440
that was last submitted in october as

1231
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,200
well

1232
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,559
yes um i have i have

1233
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,160
um i have done updates

1234
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,760
with participants i'll try and get that

1235
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,000
submitted um

1236
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,440
uh as a

1237
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,720
soon i think i think it's just waiting

1238
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,280
to go i can submit that fairly quickly

1239
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,800
and and i have updated ical4j

1240
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,040
for the the uh the new form but i

1241
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,119
haven't implemented it in there

1242
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,079
in my server yeah i don't think it

1243
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:52,720
really

1244
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,240
i think implementation experience will

1245
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,000
be the next step for that and hopefully

1246
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,599
some interop again

1247
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,200
yep but this is on the

1248
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,599
calculated gender as well right people

1249
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,640
it's a permanent item on the

1250
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,000
item it's usually in terms of it wants

1251
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,599
to talk about v-pole so

1252
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,200
you take it off and then then somebody

1253
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,559
says i'd like to talk about v-power so

1254
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,319
we put it back again

1255
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,359
yeah again before then all right

1256
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,280
v-poland recurrences always show up on

1257
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,880
an agenda someplace

1258
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,599
yep he must be nearly 10 years old now

1259
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,280
i remember it being interrupt tested at

1260
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,400
my first ever cal connect back in 2014

1261
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,839
or so

1262
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,319
yes it probably is fairly old

1263
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,040
i'm wondering regarding gs calendar how

1264
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,800
much um

1265
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,400
the discussion with the um calendar

1266
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,079
user id is affecting the

1267
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,640
viewpole calendar section

1268
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,400
uh only as much as as it's

1269
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,359
um the account user id is that is the

1270
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,160
target for the

1271
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,240
way you send stuff vipol uses standard

1272
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,280
itip

1273
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,839
to send something well he uses it with

1274
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,160
with some extensions in that it has

1275
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,800
uh some new methods because you want to

1276
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,000
indicate that it's a

1277
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,599
um a response to a you know

1278
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,760
it's a new vote coming in also that kind

1279
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,680
uh so there are a few new methods

1280
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,720
in in the thing but uh it's basically

1281
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,960
standardized it so yeah everything there

1282
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,880
will affect it to some extent

1283
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,240
so will not affect it is it no more that

1284
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,040
no more than it

1285
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,640
then anything else is affected yeah

1286
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,160
there's problems with the same

1287
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,359
yes and and i think um

1288
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,680
at the other point brown raised that we

1289
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,720
this will probably

1290
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,920
um a spec that will have a js calendar

1291
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,359
section added to it because uh by the

1292
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,400
time this comes out

1293
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,599
js calendar will be a done deal

1294
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,720
you mean another 10 years

1295
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,680
by christmas

1296
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,200
it says october 2021 in the milestones

1297
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,759
but anyway

1298
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,720
all right um and that's all that i've

1299
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,000
got slides for the rest was the

1300
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,040
milestone review

1301
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,359
and other business so do we have any

1302
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,079
other business

1303
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,400
will i find the milestones

1304
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,400
i guess not um so daniel already updated

1305
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,040
this

1306
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,559
which makes me think there's probably

1307
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,319
very little for us to do

1308
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,760
um except we may

1309
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,880
be doing i calendar series later and

1310
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,240
submitting um subscription update and

1311
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,800
relations earlier they've been dumped to

1312
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,640
june when they're going to happen

1313
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,559
right now or very soon from now

1314
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,280
um scheduling controls yes that's on me

1315
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,720
i'll get back to that i didn't even want

1316
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,839
to talk about it this time around

1317
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,920
um i think i'll look around because

1318
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,839
it's not because it's june that we can't

1319
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,240
do that in april

1320
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,000
yep it'd be nice to hit a milestone

1321
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:28,820
early for once

1322
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,160
[Laughter]

1323
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,559
all right and after all that we have a

1324
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,160
couple of minutes left at the end

1325
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,079
so it just shows how bad i was at

1326
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,359
predicting the amount of time we would

1327
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,839
need for each topic

1328
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,079
so the next cal connect is also a very

1329
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,599
inconvenient time for australians

1330
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:50,559
unfortunately

1331
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,599
it's going to be even later in the night

1332
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,119
so it's going to start i think 1am and

1333
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,880
finish 6 a.m or something crazy like

1334
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,599
that each day

1335
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,280
so that's that's going to be kind of

1336
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,800
hard so hopefully we can discuss some of

1337
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,520
this via email

1338
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,800
yeah well we do have the um

1339
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,839
thursday where we could shift we have

1340
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,119
some calls

1341
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,480
at a different time um

1342
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,240
so we might be able to fit these drafts

1343
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,160
into those um

1344
