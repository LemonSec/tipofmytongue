let's get started

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
so um i assume uh most people are aware

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,840
of the note well

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
um if you are not please have a look

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,079
and read relevant documents about code

32
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,320
of conduct and ipr related issues

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,039
where is rcs with the link i listed here

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,040
so um

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
you are assuming you're in a meeting

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
you're in the right place hopefully

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,239
um jab room is integrated with uh

38
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,599
meet echo um you don't need to

39
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,879
um go to meet to uh

40
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,160
go dmd so we um

41
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
braun has agreed to be our scribe he

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
will be taking note in codemg

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
which you can see the link here

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,599
um everybody

45
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,040
is attending the meet echo is

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
recorded automatically so you don't need

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,400
to go to meet

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
to the dmd and add your name there

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,360
and this session is being recorded

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,440
um here's the agenda um

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
i reshuffled the tickets a little bit

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,040
uh because we had the recent uh

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,480
discussion about

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,159
four four four five two versus four five

55
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,800
five five two um i moved it toward the

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,480
end just because i think it might take a

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
bit longer

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,720
uh because i would really like to get a

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,680
few tickets done

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,959
like trace header fields or at least you

61
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,280
know

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,280
as done as we possibly can

63
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
um so let's get

64
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,839
any agenda bashing

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,799
if not let's get uh

66
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
started with the first ticket

67
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,560
[Applause]

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,319
so um three's had a field

69
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,120
definition the stickers are just

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,080
summarizing

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
problem statement we have

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,680
some definitions in 53 22 and

73
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,879
21 um a lot of header fields

74
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,560
were added in other rfcs

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,519
and were described as trace header

76
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,959
fields

77
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,639
whatever it means so

78
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,360
i think we discussion on the mailing

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,479
list

80
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
is leading toward the way of

81
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,680
making definition extensible

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,919
um so with this

83
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
i'm going to let pete talk about

84
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,880
his changes which i split into uh yeah

85
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,520
he uh

86
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,440
pete did for slides for us

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,840
so i'll let him talk about this

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,039
and pete is not here is he

89
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,799
he does not seem to be

90
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
um that is a bit of a pity but let

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,360
okay let's try to to do this and see

92
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,320
if he can join us

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,360
so um there was sort of uh four type of

94
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,320
changes proposed pete suggested some

95
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,759
text

96
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,639
um based on net feedbacks and

97
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
alessandros and mine

98
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,800
hopefully this part is going to be

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
non-controversial

100
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
not suggested to actually add a

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
definition of what trace field

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
is um and this is in the new text the

103
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,600
trace field document actions taken as a

104
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
message moves through the transport

105
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
system

106
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,240
and then the other part of the change is

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,199
to clarify

108
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
that

109
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
although return path and received header

110
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,160
fields

111
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,759
are trace header fields other

112
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,840
specification can add to the list

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,919
um if people have an opinion

114
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,960
um hopefully this is non-controversial

115
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,160
but let's

116
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,120
let's hear comments

117
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,960
pete if you are here

118
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,960
you know i i figured it would be best to

119
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,440
you know

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,960
for everyone involved to shower and

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,759
brush my hair before i got here so

122
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,650
well that's fair enough

123
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,880
[Laughter]

124
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,240
so um yes

125
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
uh this was already posted to the list

126
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,639
i guess my only question is does someone

127
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,960
does anybody here have issues with this

128
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,440
particular part

129
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,960
this seemed like the non-controversial

130
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
bit

131
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
i'm personally quite happy with it um i

132
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,319
think would be nice to

133
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,880
okay john

134
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,639
well this seems to put all the burden of

135
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,360
defining this onto 5321 which i

136
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,150
yeah well

137
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,280
[Laughter]

138
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,840
you didn't think there was a plan here

139
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,280
um works for me

140
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,840
it's uh the changing the balance between

141
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
two documents but i think it's probably

142
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
the right thing to do

143
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
i mean it you know this is actually more

144
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,280
than it said

145
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,800
in 5322 um

146
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
because that first line uh

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,720
wasn't even there it basically totally

148
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,080
pushed it off to 53-21 so

149
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,000
it's it's clearly better to have it in

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,360
one place than this

151
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
and this is actually a compelling

152
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
argument that's the right place so

153
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:27,840
yes okay good so next slide

154
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
next slide next slide uh oh yes okay

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
there we go sorry

156
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,919
um so in this one

157
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,599
uh i simply at the top

158
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,480
in the syntax portion what describes the

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,440
syntax

160
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,959
it adds the um one or more receive

161
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,959
fields or other fields indicated by

162
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,240
optional field below

163
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
that are defined by other specifications

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,760
as belonging within the trace fields

165
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,720
grouping

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,040
again no one on the list seem to have a

167
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,920
problem with this

168
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,800
there's the question of the actual

169
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,160
syntax

170
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,519
um and we'll get to that in a second

171
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,519
but the wording of this seemed

172
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,880
relatively uncontroversial

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
anybody want to say otherwise

174
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,120
i'm good yeah then the return path

175
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,080
uh i assume the change if we agree that

176
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,760
the loan return path is okay

177
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,279
then we'll change yeah the change to

178
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:31,760
here

179
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,959
is is you know simple i

180
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,360
i just um i wanted to make sure that the

181
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
general structure of this was

182
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,320
okay with folks

183
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,920
okay now let's get on to the

184
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,200
nitty-gritty which is the syntax itself

185
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,040
um so next slide okay

186
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,279
um so

187
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,800
currently in 367 we've got

188
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
an optional return path followed by one

189
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,680
or more received

190
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,640
and so what i put into

191
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,519
the um the proposal on the list

192
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
was optional return path followed by

193
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,480
one or more either received or optional

194
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
fields

195
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,640
and then the question of what about a

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
loan return path can you do that

197
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,440
um and so

198
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,279
i wrote up some syntax to accomplish

199
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,399
that

200
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,079
that says okay well you can either have

201
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,680
a lone return path

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,920
or an optional return path and one or

203
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
more

204
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
um received or optional fields

205
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,959
uh

206
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,240
i don't know how people feel about this

207
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,839
what it you know go ahead john

208
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,959
um oh look it works

209
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,360
um i think on the mailing list i was i

210
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,839
was pushing for uh your your

211
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
your option with no receive fields at

212
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,360
all but actually i poked around

213
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,880
as far as i can tell in the existing

214
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,120
practice anything that

215
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,079
anything that adds a return path um will

216
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,360
add at least one received

217
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
even if it's injected internally so i

218
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,040
think your your original proposal with

219
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,760
at least one

220
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,480
actually matches reality and it's

221
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,200
somewhat

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,839
and it avoids weird situations where you

223
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,320
have

224
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,600
where you have a receive block that

225
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,240
contains nothing at all

226
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,600
so go ahead

227
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,720
i i oh no i that was just me echoing

228
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
um alexi

229
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,760
um i'm trying to channel ned here

230
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,120
because he's not here unfortunately

231
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,839
um and i think

232
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,680
yes when we are talking if we are

233
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
talking about message created post

234
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
delivery this is going to be true

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
fortunately unfortunately various

236
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,600
other types of software will strip

237
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,160
received uh so i think

238
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,200
we need to accommodate that because um

239
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,079
this spec net's argument is that this

240
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:26,560
spec

241
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,079
is more generic than just for smtp

242
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
so which i don't agree right

243
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,279
and i was gonna look beforehand and

244
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
um and let me take a quick look here

245
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,040
uh yeah so i mean

246
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,519
one possible um

247
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,320
avoidance of the issue is simply to say

248
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
look we've got these nice

249
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,279
you know obs fields the the obsolete

250
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,240
syntax the read-only syntax

251
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,839
um does that satisfy this particular

252
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,480
problem

253
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
i don't think it's a question of being

254
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
obsolete though

255
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
it's not but there's lots of things in

256
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
obsolete which are

257
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
well we accept that such things exist in

258
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
the universe

259
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,959
um but you shouldn't send them on the

260
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,639
wire

261
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,200
and now what ned's talking about is in

262
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,800
an imap context

263
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,839
um which is wire so i

264
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,320
i don't know that it really satisfies

265
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,440
that

266
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,440
um and my preference

267
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,959
i'm a preference in this document so

268
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,560
with the exception of saying you know

269
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,160
when you create draft messages which

270
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,880
might

271
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,800
have missing fields everything otherwise

272
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,959
it complies right

273
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,320
right um assuming that john and alexi

274
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,839
just haven't lowered their hands yet

275
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,120
dave did you want to hop in here

276
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
um so

277
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
what what i think i heard you describing

278
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,079
is imposing a requirement for fields

279
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,160
that have not been required in the past

280
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,560
and for which even though there's a

281
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,399
practice that might match

282
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,040
that requirement um there's no

283
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,399
operational need

284
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,160
to impose the requirement so demanding

285
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,120
that there be

286
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,680
trace fields doesn't make a lot of sense

287
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,880
to me

288
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,480
in the absence of a compelling

289
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,040
operational requirement for that

290
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,480
similarly uh putting things in obs field

291
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,800
i i don't understand the utility of

292
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
bob's field i understand the intent

293
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,959
behind creating it but in terms of real

294
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
world effect

295
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,560
put putting something there with the

296
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,320
belief that it it means something

297
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
doesn't match what i think has been

298
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,839
demonstrated reality yeah

299
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,880
um well what do i want to say i

300
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,639
i i apologize

301
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,440
i'm on mute i don't appear to be oh

302
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,160
maybe

303
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,720
art can you hear me now oh the system is

304
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,639
more intelligent than any of us expected

305
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,839
yeah i can hear you dude

306
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,519
um um so in any event i i um

307
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,560
i i apologize you can hear it wow it's

308
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
really intelligent

309
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,000
yeah um i i hereby apologize for my

310
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
uh uh 20-year less of

311
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,639
itself um

312
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,519
yeah the ops field thing had we had to

313
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,120
do it over again we might have had a

314
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,560
different discussion

315
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,079
um because i hate it now myself but

316
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,839
um so dave can you hear me

317
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,880
no now i can't hear dave that's kind of

318
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,040
fun

319
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,199
i think dave is having audio problems i

320
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,240
can hear you now

321
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
it's interesting medico has a reconnect

322
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
audio button which suggests this is a

323
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,279
common problem

324
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,120
so i didn't hear much of what you said

325
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
except right so

326
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,680
i i apologize for um my

327
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,800
20-year less age ago self um

328
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,160
uh yeah the obs fields uh

329
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,759
if we had to do it over again i'd have

330
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,440
argued differently

331
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,320
um that they were meant to be you're

332
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
gonna have to deal with messages

333
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,839
that have these things um and so for

334
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,360
parsing purposes

335
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,399
um you might look at the obs fields to

336
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
explain how to parse what might

337
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,639
otherwise look

338
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,440
horrible from the um the the true and um

339
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,440
you know correct fields in section three

340
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,519
i i yeah um for whatever that's worth

341
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,079
um the the audio issue i was having i

342
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,600
think i've now figured out

343
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,680
and it's bizarre if the microphone is on

344
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,040
uh so i can talk like i'm talking now

345
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,839
then i can't hear you probably anyone

346
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,800
else talking

347
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,560
and i have to go on mute in order to

348
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,520
hear you which is really interesting

349
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,319
i mean at one level i like that idea but

350
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
it's not actually conducive to

351
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,520
conversation at any rate

352
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,959
um what you've just done is describe

353
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,599
an interesting idea for the obs field

354
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,079
but it

355
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
again has nothing to do with actual

356
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,319
practice and so

357
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,919
imposing a theory of its use um

358
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,079
is an interesting academic exercise but

359
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,440
doesn't have much to do with the real

360
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,080
world

361
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
and i'd advise against uh our being

362
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,440
clever that way

363
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,280
um right i i don't disagree with you

364
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
and it like i said in this particular

365
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,640
case

366
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
you know ned's talking about well i'm on

367
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
this imap server i'm creating a message

368
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,960
where i'm

369
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,760
you know somehow editing a message to

370
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,400
add this stuff that is currently

371
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,679
not acceptable in the syntax so

372
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,559
uh it does seem like maybe we should

373
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,520
make a change somehow

374
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
um anybody else on this i mean

375
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,640
john levine's comment was sorry

376
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,880
effort it takes to deal with the trace

377
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,919
field the more

378
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,080
it raises the question of why it's

379
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
worthy of this energy

380
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,720
given that there was no concern about

381
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,960
the trace field until the delivered two

382
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,600
stuff

383
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
came up and um the nature of this

384
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,000
working group

385
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,440
is to fix significant problems now

386
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,600
again in the abstract i get what's

387
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,960
driving this because there's

388
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
inconsistencies etc

389
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,760
and but there hasn't been an operational

390
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,400
problem

391
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,640
that this is solving there's an

392
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,400
intellectual problem it's solving

393
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,720
there's a formal specification problem

394
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,760
that's solving

395
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,559
and again that that at that level that

396
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
makes sense but in terms of what the

397
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
scope and intent of this working group

398
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,280
is

399
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,918
i don't get it

400
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,880
uh so go ahead alexis but i i'll have a

401
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
comment on that

402
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,960
dave i think the issue is that basically

403
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,799
existing practices didn't match the

404
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,600
document

405
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,199
so the document needs to be fixed

406
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,320
examples of existing practice problems

407
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,120
so i apologize for that

408
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,799
so the authentication results and

409
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,039
uh i defined one had

410
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,320
had a field i think x400 has also

411
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,600
received type had a field uh

412
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,120
so but but the practice

413
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,440
the the the practice that dave was

414
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
referring to

415
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
is that they get treated

416
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,120
like other trace fields by

417
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,960
in certain circumstances stripping them

418
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
out in certain circumstances

419
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
using it to trace the message that they

420
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,960
in fact do get treated like these fields

421
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
but they were never allowed in that

422
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,320
block before

423
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,159
which is why you introduce optional

424
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,799
field into the trace

425
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,520
element itself because then you can say

426
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,280
and and they've been labeled in other

427
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
documents as

428
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,200
trace in order to indicate you want to

429
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,720
be able to strip these out

430
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,120
in other cases where you would strip out

431
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,320
trace fields

432
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,760
and so you want to indicate in the

433
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,919
document these are permissible in

434
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
a block of trace fields and then the

435
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,240
issue came up

436
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,960
okay well if you can do that you might

437
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,440
want to

438
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,039
do something else

439
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,799
again as a construct that sounds great

440
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,000
what what and and were the goal to

441
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,720
produce

442
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
a much much cleaner version of these

443
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,400
specifications

444
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,640
that'd be great i didn't understand that

445
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
to be the goal of this working group i

446
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,919
thought the goal of this grouping was

447
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,000
dramatically more narrow

448
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,520
and so for all that you've just said

449
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,559
and described i don't believe it's

450
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,600
actually had

451
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,720
operational uh problems that it's caused

452
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,240
it's causing problems in uh one's desire

453
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,799
for clarity and consistency and purity

454
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,520
about

455
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,320
the term trace field i get that but

456
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,640
nothing that i know of that actually has

457
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,880
affected operations or implementations

458
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
this question the other way around um

459
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,760
and ask i guess to dave

460
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,080
if we did define this in this way would

461
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,000
that affect operations either

462
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,240
if if we tied this document up more than

463
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
more than strictly necessary

464
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
does that cause problems

465
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,679
i predict that it it would constitute

466
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,480
doing something

467
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,400
outside of the scope of this working

468
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,799
group one can imagine a working group

469
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,080
that has the goal that you just

470
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,240
described perfectly great goal

471
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,400
but doesn't match what i thought the

472
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
goal of this working group was which was

473
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
really severely constrained

474
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,000
yeah that's not the question i asked the

475
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,600
question i asked was

476
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,880
if we did this would it cause

477
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,679
operational problems would it cause

478
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,039
communication problems would it cause

479
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,640
a working group with a larger scope and

480
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,960
the problem with the question you asked

481
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,480
is not that it's an unreasonable

482
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,080
question it's a perfectly fine

483
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,200
question but how is it in the scope of

484
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,760
this group

485
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
i'm struggling to understand

486
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
what your motivation is for questioning

487
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,880
it

488
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,640
because you haven't answered my question

489
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,200
twice now

490
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,360
and you sorry i can't hear you

491
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,159
so i'm questioning the question the

492
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,200
reason i'm not answering it is because

493
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,360
why is the question appropriate for this

494
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,080
group is what i'm asking

495
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,480
um barry who's our area director and

496
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,080
murray who's also an area director are

497
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,919
both in the queue here so maybe they can

498
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,320
have some comments on the scope question

499
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,039
i'll pop off

500
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,520
well i'll jump in i i think dave is

501
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,720
correct

502
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,000
um we made the scope of this very narrow

503
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
on purpose and there are good reasons

504
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
that we did that

505
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,240
so yes let's be careful about making

506
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,200
changes

507
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,320
that aren't really necessary

508
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
so i think i agree with dave that we

509
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
were better off minimizing the change

510
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,760
in this area because i think the answer

511
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,640
is that no

512
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,039
we're not affecting we're not doing

513
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,880
something that's affecting operations

514
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,840
so let's um let's try to keep this part

515
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
simple

516
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,559
i don't actually agree with no affecting

517
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,559
operations because what people

518
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,559
use existing trace like header fields

519
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,120
for

520
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,080
is not agreeing with the current spec

521
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,320
because of expectations of email systems

522
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,279
basically

523
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,440
so this is aligning existing practice

524
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
with

525
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,240
what the documents is saying

526
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,840
so i think right the issue here is you

527
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,559
uh

528
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,240
an imap uh imap creates a message

529
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,159
it hasn't gone anywhere yet so it has no

530
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,520
trace fields

531
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,760
and according to this it's strictly

532
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,879
speaking invalid

533
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,559
let's let's back up a second um

534
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,120
if it hasn't recorded any trace fields

535
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,520
no return path no receive fields

536
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,400
no optional fields up at the top it's

537
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,840
perfectly valid

538
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,880
because it the in section

539
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,320
the top of section 3.6 the entire

540
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,679
trace block is optional right

541
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,159
there are two things being done that

542
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,600
we're discussing here

543
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,039
one is whether a return

544
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,000
path alone in a trace block is a

545
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
reasonable thing to do

546
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,640
without any other received or optional

547
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,200
fields

548
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,000
right and whether that should be made um

549
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,960
legitimate

550
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,240
and then there's a a separate question

551
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
um uh coming up oh well and then there's

552
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,679
the separate question about whether

553
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
optional fields need to be expressed as

554
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,679
part of the trace block because of these

555
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,919
other uses of the word trace

556
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,640
in other documents or is it okay for

557
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,000
them just to float

558
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,120
freely in the top of the message right

559
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
and and

560
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,559
up until now some have floated freely in

561
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,640
the message correct

562
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,760
well but that's that was going to be my

563
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,600
next set of questions on the next slide

564
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,360
is is it yeah but but

565
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
i i mean that's a good question are

566
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,520
there are there things

567
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,600
up free in the top of the message that

568
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,440
are not part of

569
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,120
the trace block is you know a another

570
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,960
separate question

571
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,640
okay and right and i guess what what

572
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
dave is suggesting and what i'm

573
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,080
agreeing with is that uh that they have

574
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,240
floated and that that has not caused

575
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,760
problems in the past

576
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,600
let's not try to fix that now

577
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,200
and i guess that part is not being said

578
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,679
as an ad

579
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,000
the let's keep it as simple as we can is

580
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,039
the ad

581
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,520
pronouncement the rest is my opinion

582
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,679
i'll let you run the queue alexi

583
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,880
ah braun do you still want to talk

584
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,600
now john

585
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,799
this the pathway going down is making me

586
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,559
a little nervous

587
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,360
because it seems to say that if

588
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,159
something was

589
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,000
not in five three two two

590
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,799
but people have been doing it anyway

591
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,200
that

592
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,440
or it is only okay but it's okay not to

593
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
say anything about it

594
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,960
and that is inconsistent

595
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,240
with the definition

596
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,600
of a uh of internet standard

597
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,919
because the internet standard is

598
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,159
supposed to reflect reality

599
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,440
and uh and the fact that in the last

600
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,480
decade or so things have started getting

601
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:38,880
done

602
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,279
which we haven't paid attention to and

603
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,080
that have not

604
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,840
caused uh 532 to to collapse into

605
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
disrepute

606
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,960
uh does is doesn't align with that

607
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,039
uh so i i think i'm okay with this

608
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,159
either way but uh

609
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,679
but the argument that it wasn't

610
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,799
in five three two two and uh and people

611
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,919
have been doing it

612
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,399
and uh and therefore we don't need to

613
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,919
reflect it now

614
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,440
in any way at all uh seems to me

615
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,880
to be uh putting us on a slippery slope

616
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
and since some of these things which

617
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,640
have been done and haven't

618
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,679
worked at 532 uh use the term trace

619
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,600
field explicitly

620
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,799
um and uh and are on the standard track

621
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,960
uh it seems to me that we're creating

622
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,440
some nasty spaghetti threading

623
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,440
and uh uh and and really ignoring what

624
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,480
the uh

625
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
the goal of an internet standard is

626
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,520
supposed to be

627
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,279
and if the scope of this working group

628
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,159
is defined

629
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,640
as do things which are not consistent

630
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,000
with what an internet standard is

631
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,200
supposed to be about

632
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,799
that then we're in serious trouble

633
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,559
so i'm not certain we're there but it

634
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,320
feels but the scope is feeling very

635
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,360
slippery at the moment

636
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,399
right i i sort of share john's concern

637
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
i think if it doesn't reflect reality i

638
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,559
believe we need to fix it

639
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,399
um can i just attempt

640
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,919
lost gowat missing received heavy field

641
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,600
and then we can move on to the next

642
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,120
slide which is uh

643
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,919
we already started discussing in yeah

644
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,120
let's

645
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,919
yeah let's do the next slide because

646
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,919
that might also change

647
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
people's opinions about this i don't

648
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,039
know

649
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,039
can i just quickly so we were talking

650
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,440
we were concentrating on imap but

651
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,960
actually imap is no

652
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,120
not the only thing that does this um

653
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,200
in a map case we potentially can fix it

654
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,240
in other ways

655
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,760
um consider

656
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,120
male filters or

657
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,719
you know i'm very uh

658
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,639
um

659
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,919
basically system that strips uh received

660
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,720
header fields

661
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,240
uh on leaving the main

662
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,720
for security reasons this happens all

663
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,640
the time

664
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,000
to hide internal um

665
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,640
information about internal network so

666
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,440
this is not the case the milter's

667
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,000
question

668
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
which was alessandra's point let's leave

669
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,480
aside for a second let me ask about

670
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,440
the the stripping case um are they

671
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,080
stripping

672
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,760
and not stripping return paths

673
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
or they just they're they're stripping

674
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,120
everything and

675
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,000
the the issue you're pointing out is um

676
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,440
they want to be able to strip

677
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
like authentication results but um

678
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,760
don't have any syntactic justification

679
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,360
to do that because it's not in the trace

680
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
block

681
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,679
that i don't know whether they stream

682
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,600
both who just uh just received

683
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,640
braun did you have a an opinion on this

684
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,960
union as a software author and per

685
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,399
person who works with many software

686
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,039
authors

687
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,039
the chances are they strip an arbitrary

688
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,720
set of headers that have been encoded

689
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,200
into a

690
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,240
regular expression somewhere um where

691
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,600
they get the definition of what should

692
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,080
be in that

693
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,200
regular expression is 90

694
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,640
just looking at a few emails that went

695
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,320
through their system and 10 looking at

696
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,760
our documents and hopefully at least

697
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,399
that 10

698
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,159
gives them something that is actionable

699
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,000
right right right right right

700
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,240
all right john and let's move on to the

701
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,799
next slide

702
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,039
i think john was a ghost of a previous

703
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,480
hand in the air

704
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,600
all right he's a ghost

705
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,840
okay

706
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,840
fine so um

707
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,480
i'm not entirely sure whether we are

708
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,080
where we are between proposal on the

709
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
list and possible proposal at the bottom

710
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,039
um i think we probably need to take this

711
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,840
to the main list still

712
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,120
this fair yeah i i i think at least we

713
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,480
have to take this to the mailing list

714
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,120
unless

715
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,880
something in the next slide makes people

716
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,159
look back at this and go

717
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,720
oh well if that's true then then it's

718
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,840
obvious what we need to do

719
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,959
but i don't okay fine

720
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,159
okay so um currently

721
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,760
in uh 3.6

722
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,080
that's what the top looks like so you've

723
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,360
got an optional field

724
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,960
at so let's start with the top there is

725
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,840
an optional block of stuff that is

726
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,640
either

727
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,760
trace optional fields

728
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,200
or recent blocks right

729
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,000
and that's at the top and then what

730
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,760
follows that

731
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,880
is a

732
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,000
an optional block um of as many

733
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,320
as you like the rest of the header

734
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
fields

735
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,320
date from sender there's also an

736
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,279
optional field

737
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,679
in that block just in case you want to

738
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,840
add different kinds of fields in the

739
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,960
latter

740
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,000
but that's the way it looks okay

741
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,200
so you've got the header block which is

742
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,679
trace

743
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,080
optional or recent and then you've got

744
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,120
the rest of

745
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,679
the headers again as many times as you

746
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:50,240
want

747
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,399
which are the standard headers plus

748
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,679
option field

749
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,960
okay next

750
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,000
uh there is no more slides from you this

751
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
is the slide

752
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,918
oh you truncated the oh really bummer

753
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,119
sorry um it was just too small to

754
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,520
uh right right right right no that's

755
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,159
okay

756
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,839
um yep so the proposal

757
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,280
that um i made i think on the list

758
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,399
was if optional field

759
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,000
is going to be in trace anyway

760
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,199
do we need it separately

761
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,800
as an optional field in

762
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,320
the whole top of the header fields

763
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,960
where trace recent and other things can

764
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,679
go

765
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,280
or is every additional field that will

766
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,040
appear in that block

767
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,399
in the top of it in the top of a header

768
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,679
block

769
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,399
going to be either trace which includes

770
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,119
optional

771
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,240
or the reset fields

772
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
because then we could get rid of one

773
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
occurrence of the optional field which

774
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,200
to me seems

775
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,839
like a good cleanup optional field was

776
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,160
added to 5322

777
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,839
from 2822 when someone realized

778
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,359
that you couldn't put authentication

779
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,280
results at the top of the message which

780
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,640
everybody agreed was a screw up

781
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,240
any strong feelings about this

782
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,320
so um sorry

783
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,160
if i can jump the cue uh

784
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,640
for me the question is can

785
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,240
uh non-trace header fields

786
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,560
be inserted at the top do we have

787
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,440
examples like this

788
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,680
and dan says i i don't know

789
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,680
yeah i i didn't know either because um

790
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,480
the side effect of removing this is then

791
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,400
disallow disallowing them if they

792
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,160
already existed

793
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,880
um and that's what i suppose it's hard

794
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
to prove

795
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,079
um john

796
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,240
um i have not fully thought this out so

797
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,280
this is a

798
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,480
it's a snap reaction i may regret

799
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,160
but if your intent per earlier

800
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,760
conversation

801
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,800
is to put the actual definition of most

802
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,599
or all of these trace fields into

803
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,880
uh five three two one

804
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,119
then the optionality is going to have to

805
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,520
then there has to be optionality there

806
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,640
regardless of what additional

807
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,520
optionality 5322

808
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,400
uh provides because there might very

809
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,240
well be transport level

810
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,320
optionality as well as um

811
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,000
uh post delivery header optionality

812
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,200
so my gut is telling me that while this

813
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,560
looks like a simple kit

814
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
while taking that out would be said

815
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,760
feels like a simplification

816
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,920
it actually isn't especially if we're

817
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,800
going to

818
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
switch all all of the semantics and some

819
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
of the syntax into

820
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,880
5321 fair enough

821
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,720
wrong again i could be persuaded i'm

822
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,240
wrong but that's my gun reaction

823
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,119
uh again i'm coming from implementation

824
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,200
experience here looking at what cyrus

825
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,079
imap does

826
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,839
and what my subscript does that puts a

827
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,440
little header in that i just randomly

828
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,000
added to

829
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
stuff and the edit header extension just

830
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
pops new headers at the top

831
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,960
regardless of anything there's no smart

832
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,320
regardless headers

833
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,400
or what order they're in i have worked

834
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,359
with systems that

835
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,040
reorder headers in all sorts of

836
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,480
different ways as the

837
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,359
messages go through um if you're really

838
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,640
lucky at least i'll keep the received

839
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,400
headers in the same order so headers

840
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,920
with the same name won't get sorted

841
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,680
internally as well but

842
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
all bets are off they could very well

843
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,079
have been thrown into a hashing

844
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,520
algorithm that just spits them out in

845
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,440
whatever order it spits them out

846
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,720
um so anything that puts explicit

847
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,359
ordering

848
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,040
on which headers are allowed above or

849
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,880
below any other headers

850
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,200
is going to run into difficulties and

851
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
i'm wondering why we have

852
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
any ordering requirement at all um given

853
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,839
that it doesn't seem to be an

854
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,520
operational problem

855
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,480
i mean there there is already and note

856
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,119
here that

857
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,560
this the the syntax that was in 5322

858
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,320
does impose an ordering which probably

859
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,119
is um at least dodgy with regard to

860
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,079
reality

861
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,800
which is that all of the recent and all

862
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
of the trace fields

863
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,800
need to be above from sender

864
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,400
origination date everything else um

865
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,599
but there's an explicit warning in 5322

866
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,640
which says

867
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,560
these things can be reordered and you

868
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,480
should try and keep them in these blocks

869
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,200
so that people can follow the path of

870
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,720
transport but

871
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,000
um you you can't depend on that

872
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,119
um so

873
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,400
yeah for whatever for whatever it's

874
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
worth

875
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,839
cool

876
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,160
um yeah as a participant i think i would

877
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,880
rather leave

878
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,839
optional field here and just for the

879
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,119
reasons that braun

880
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,760
and and john stated and just let this

881
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,200
section be as is

882
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,359
i think that it feels like this also

883
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,640
will uh

884
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,040
um make alessandro haiti

885
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,480
yes i think so um

886
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,720
okay so in that case we we are really

887
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,359
for issue number seven we're strictly

888
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,440
talking about 367

889
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,720
and whether trace itself should be

890
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,160
defined as

891
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,440
allowing fields other than

892
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,359
return path and received

893
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,759
and

894
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,960
whether the syntax should allow for

895
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,079
a return path with no received or other

896
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,960
fields

897
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,440
next to it and i don't think we've got

898
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,119
consensus from what folks have been

899
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,599
saying online i think we do have

900
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,920
consensus that we want extensibility we

901
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,560
don't have

902
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,640
consensus about optional received

903
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,520
well but it extensibility pure

904
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
extensibility

905
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,640
you could do in

906
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,240
oh about optional received um

907
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,680
right so i think your text is right

908
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,480
uh but the abnf is still in question

909
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,920
basically

910
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,240
okay

911
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,160
yeah the the way um

912
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,160
the way the syntax in 3.6 appears

913
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,760
if you have recent or if you have some

914
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,720
optional field at the top

915
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,200
um then you must have at least one

916
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,440
received field

917
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,839
which may be not what we want

918
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,480
as a proposal to get uh moving on this

919
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,839
specific issue maybe we can do a short

920
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,599
um poll on the mailing list where the

921
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,119
people know

922
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,280
whether it's just received in strip both

923
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,160
returned

924
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,079
received and maybe people might not have

925
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,200
specific knowledge about this or we can

926
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,560
find people who can

927
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,040
help us okay i'm willing to hold in my

928
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,160
holding pattern and

929
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:02,000
wait for the list

930
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,720
that's all i got

931
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,959
oh

932
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,520
i think there are a couple of related

933
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,319
issues

934
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,520
in 5321 i don't think at this point

935
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,640
we have specific suggestions for change

936
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,680
um the only uh related issue is going to

937
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,119
be on the following slide

938
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,160
is about the registry um for

939
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,118
trace header fields

940
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,800
and proposal for this is to have it in

941
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,599
the

942
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,880
applicability statement document so john

943
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,359
if you want to say anything about

944
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,040
racecar refuels and 5321 this

945
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,359
now

946
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,680
um i i i'm going to need to think about

947
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,160
this with my snap reaction

948
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,359
is that if the uh if the trace header

949
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:06,800
fields

950
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,200
uh plus or minus optional are

951
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
are going to be shifting in five three

952
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,480
two one

953
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,319
in terms of precise definition and

954
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:17,599
semantics

955
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,839
then i think the registry definition has

956
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,440
to at least be mentioned there

957
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,160
probably that particular if if we're

958
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,520
keeping a separate

959
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
trace field registry then that should

960
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,000
probably be defined in 5321

961
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,280
rather than 5322

962
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,560
but again that that's more uh more

963
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,160
instinct than anything i've spent time

964
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:42,880
thinking about

965
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,839
so so do you prefer for uh the register

966
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,480
to be

967
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,359
defined in five three two one or

968
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,400
applicability statement

969
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,119
uh my instinct right now would be to

970
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,119
define it in one

971
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,160
and uh and then mention it in five three

972
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,480
two

973
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,200
two if uh if if that seems to be

974
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,839
appropriate

975
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,040
as pete unfolds the text but i don't

976
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,640
feel really strongly about it

977
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,879
yet okay fine

978
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,000
so moving on to the specific text about

979
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,599
uh registry this is ticket number eight

980
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,640
um a few months ago i proposed

981
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,880
uh initial text and there were various

982
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,440
changes suggested so let me talk about

983
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:43,920
this

984
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,480
um the current text

985
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,760
proposed text on the slide suggest

986
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,720
updated version module the issue at the

987
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,440
end

988
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,480
about uh registration procedure so

989
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,760
i am is um to create a new subregistry

990
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,280
for email header fields that can be

991
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,440
added to a message header section by

992
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,079
msa mta mda um the new subregistry

993
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,599
would show where the header fields can

994
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,079
be added by message submission relay

995
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,119
delivery

996
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,960
system or some combination of them so

997
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
they are basically various columns

998
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,480
uh in the registry um

999
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,240
this definition got expanded initially i

1000
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,079
think it was just too late delivery

1001
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,599
and then people asked what about

1002
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,680
submission so they seem to be support

1003
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,240
for mentioning submission here

1004
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,920
that the next change is

1005
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,119
um earlier version was saying that

1006
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,200
heather fields in this registry must be

1007
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,560
registered in their headfields registry

1008
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,599
whether permanent or provisional the

1009
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,760
current proposal is

1010
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,839
to have it as a should um

1011
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,760
feedback received on the mailing list

1012
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,839
was that uh

1013
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,760
well various implementations have their

1014
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,000
own

1015
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,040
um huddy fields they don't necessarily

1016
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,000
want to be

1017
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,280
forced to register in in in the main

1018
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,240
registry

1019
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,480
um but i think it's still a good idea so

1020
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,359
hopefully should we'll

1021
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,119
keep people happy with their own x-dash

1022
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,560
version of header fields

1023
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,520
and then the final question is

1024
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,520
registration procedure for this

1025
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,480
initial proposal said expert review

1026
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,040
again there was some pushback saying

1027
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,520
well

1028
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,280
um what if i want to register my own

1029
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,720
proprietary header field and then um can

1030
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,160
the experts say no

1031
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,079
and possible proposal is first come

1032
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,920
first serve

1033
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,920
however in this case the question is

1034
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,200
if somebody register registers

1035
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,200
a header fields on this registry already

1036
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,520
defined in rfc

1037
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,119
and register it incorrectly

1038
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,880
how we are going to handle this

1039
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,839
comments suggestions

1040
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,359
john

1041
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,319
and we don't hear you

1042
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,640
i think this is fine i think expert

1043
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,319
review makes sense so long as we

1044
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,440
understand that the goal

1045
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,079
that the expert's job is just to weed

1046
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
out stuff that seems

1047
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,240
um obviously wrong you know if i

1048
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,400
if i if if i'm you know if i'm

1049
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,839
registering content type as

1050
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,880
as a as a trace header perhaps the

1051
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,720
expert can push back on that

1052
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,200
and i also wondering you know my wearing

1053
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,640
my database hat

1054
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,920
i'm wondering whether this would make

1055
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,079
more sense as another column in the main

1056
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,359
in the main table rather than as a

1057
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,040
separate table that we're trying to keep

1058
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,400
keep in sync but i see the point that

1059
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,440
people might want to register their

1060
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,720
private thing so they don't so they

1061
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,200
don't have to stay in sync so basically

1062
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,879
i think as proposed it looks okay

1063
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:35,839
okay thank you

1064
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,319
okay if

1065
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,079
people don't have any comments on this

1066
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,960
one let's move on

1067
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,920
seems like we're getting some kind of uh

1068
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,040
closure on this one

1069
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,440
so i'll propose latest text on the

1070
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,040
mailing list and

1071
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,640
hopefully we can close this ticket

1072
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,760
right now we are coming up with the five

1073
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,720
seconds

1074
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,200
but nobody called on me so let me jump

1075
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,559
in

1076
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,599
um i strongly suggest when you propose

1077
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,040
that text that you

1078
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,440
make sure you put in text with

1079
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,200
instructions to the expert reviewer

1080
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,480
along the lines that

1081
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,520
of what john said yeah i believe so that

1082
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,119
that's the part that was missing saying

1083
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:38,319
you know you don't want to

1084
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,480
if somebody put subject or content type

1085
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,160
there you know there is a ground to

1086
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,359
to uh registration but other than that

1087
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,920
yeah just register basically yeah yeah

1088
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,680
great so um

1089
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,520
now we are starting with the fun section

1090
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,680
about e-hello

1091
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,960
everybody get your coffee

1092
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,839
so this ticket number 19

1093
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,200
is about two

1094
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,960
sentences um talking about the hello and

1095
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,680
checking domain name against the

1096
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,960
corresponding ip address

1097
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,119
um on this slide we are talking about

1098
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,000
the first sentence

1099
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,119
which is in bold as nsmtp server may

1100
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,040
verify the domain name argument in the

1101
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,559
if hello command

1102
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,359
actually corresponds to the ip address

1103
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:36,640
of the client

1104
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,319
um and the proposal is

1105
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,400
an smtp server may verify that the

1106
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,839
domain name argument in the

1107
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,559
hello command has an address record

1108
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,319
matching the ap address of the client

1109
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,680
just small possible clarification to

1110
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,280
this do we want to be more specific

1111
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,599
about what address record is do we mean

1112
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,160
a

1113
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,879
quadruple a

1114
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,839
so what do people think about

1115
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,839
this change

1116
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,400
barry

1117
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,760
um as a participant not as a d um

1118
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,160
yeah i like the change that's proposed i

1119
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,800
would also

1120
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,440
add the word alone to the end of the

1121
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,440
second sentence in that paragraph

1122
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,920
um must not work for the next slide so

1123
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,559
let's wait

1124
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,720
okay and uh

1125
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,640
yeah that's fine i'm happy with that

1126
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,119
change and

1127
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,119
i don't know that we need to clarify

1128
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,640
what address record is

1129
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:05,359
i think it's okay the way it is

1130
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,598
john

1131
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,800
i think i think i agree with barry i'm

1132
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,520
uh

1133
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,960
i'm not certain that i see in

1134
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,720
either case the necessity for doing this

1135
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,079
but i don't think it makes things any

1136
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,400
worse might make it a little better

1137
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,839
and uh the dress record was deliberately

1138
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:34,000
left a little vague in

1139
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,040
uh in

1140
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,599
28 21 and 53-21

1141
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,319
um because we were slightly concerned

1142
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:44,800
that

1143
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,160
uh that ipv6 might implode and we might

1144
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,119
end up with

1145
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,559
ipv something or else at some stage uh

1146
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,599
and uh and i think it's probably

1147
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,839
wise to uh to preserve that

1148
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,359
uh that flexibility unless this

1149
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,880
compelling reason

1150
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,400
for saying it's gotta be one of these

1151
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,640
two

1152
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,319
right i think uh my

1153
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,800
gut reaction was like do we want to make

1154
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,160
sure that people don't do something

1155
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,598
silly like i don't know imax

1156
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,839
but yeah fine all right uh braun

1157
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,200
most of what i want to say has already

1158
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,200
been said by the previous two people

1159
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,800
i mean this is basically an op it's a

1160
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,319
they may verify

1161
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,880
um smtp server may do whatever the hell

1162
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,680
it likes

1163
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,440
you connect to it it decides whether it

1164
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,200
wants to talk to you or not and and

1165
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,200
tells you to go away for whatever reason

1166
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,119
um this is really just telling people

1167
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,319
this is a thing that

1168
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,440
smtp servers are likely more more likely

1169
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,040
than not to do

1170
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,040
um so making it as

1171
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,200
this this is a thing that is good to do

1172
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,400
is pretty much what you're saying to

1173
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,280
people reading this

1174
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,359
because snpp servers are likely to treat

1175
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,599
you differently based on that

1176
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,960
right john

1177
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,200
broad's right and uh and as i'm

1178
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,720
remembering this

1179
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,640
the main reason for the first sentence

1180
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,359
there in either the old form of the new

1181
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,960
form the main reason for the first

1182
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,760
sentence there

1183
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,280
is to provide an introduction in the

1184
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,760
second sentence which is the prohibition

1185
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,200
against doing anything

1186
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,280
if you say don't if you find an ip

1187
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,680
address and say you don't like it

1188
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,200
right okay and of course that probably

1189
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,359
slightly overwritten by the operational

1190
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,200
necessity clause but that's another

1191
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,160
problem or

1192
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,118
issue or something

1193
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,640
okay uh so um this particular change

1194
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,079
seems non-controversial

1195
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,040
so let's move on to the next slide which

1196
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:58,319
is slightly more controversial

1197
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,079
so in regards to the second sentence

1198
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,920
um i think basically

1199
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,400
various people uh observe that must not

1200
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,720
just does not reflect reality that

1201
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,079
a lot of implementations check that

1202
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,200
in violation of this and

1203
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,119
actually uh sam pointed out that

1204
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,079
some servers uh have option whether to

1205
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,520
check this or not

1206
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,440
configuration option and yeah this is

1207
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,280
very true we have it in our own

1208
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,839
implementation for example

1209
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,799
um so suggestion is to change

1210
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,480
must not to should not um

1211
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,359
and add explanation probably an

1212
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,440
applicability statement document about

1213
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,160
dangers of this and why should not

1214
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,280
specifically

1215
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,520
right barry yeah so here's where we get

1216
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,720
my thing i agree with should not

1217
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,200
and i would add either the word solely

1218
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,960
aft after the word message or alone at

1219
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,559
the end of the sentence

1220
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,839
to give an indication that they can

1221
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,400
certainly use that information as part

1222
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,760
of the decision

1223
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,680
but it shouldn't be the only basis for

1224
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,240
the decision

1225
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,359
all right todd

1226
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,280
i i disagree i think it should be a

1227
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,240
sole basis for the decision uh and just

1228
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,200
based on

1229
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,040
established anti-abuse practice if uh

1230
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,740
hosts hellos as

1231
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,839
[Music]

1232
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,880
you know say mail.google.com but they're

1233
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,359
they're coming from some random consumer

1234
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,200
space in romania or whatever

1235
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,040
um that's that's enough right there to

1236
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,319
to reject the connection

1237
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,680
if you haven't already blocked it just

1238
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,720
based on the source ip

1239
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,559
you clearly have you clearly have a

1240
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,060
client at that point that is trying to

1241
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,280
[Music]

1242
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,880
um is at best misconfigured

1243
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,599
and at worst is is trying to abuse your

1244
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,960
system

1245
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,640
and that's enough to just shut down the

1246
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,760
connection right there and send it on

1247
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,280
his very way

1248
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,359
so then then you're advocating not for

1249
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:18,400
should not but for

1250
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,240
may yes i'm advocating for may

1251
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,839
okay okay prom

1252
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,640
i think for something else entirely

1253
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,480
which is just cut this

1254
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,799
it adds nothing it means nothing just

1255
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:37,839
cut the whole

1256
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,359
the whole paragraph don't don't make any

1257
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:42,880
statement about what the server should

1258
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,599
may

1259
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,920
maybe could do the server will do what

1260
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,319
it will do

1261
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,240
we don't need to say what it may or may

1262
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,960
not do put it in the applicability

1263
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,160
statement

1264
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,920
pointed to that yeah potentially putting

1265
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,520
the applicability statement put in

1266
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,680
in some kind of best practices thing but

1267
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,119
it doesn't need to have any normative

1268
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,359
statement about what the server will do

1269
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,880
just this this is the thing it's likely

1270
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,119
to look at

1271
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,640
please make sure you manage your

1272
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,799
proposal and your notes

1273
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,119
john

1274
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,160
yeah i think brian just anticipated my

1275
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,520
comment if if we're good i i i i'm

1276
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,280
vaguely in favor of should with the

1277
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,280
changes change that barry

1278
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,280
suggested but if we're going to move

1279
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,799
this to

1280
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,520
um the server may look at this and if it

1281
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,040
does look at this it may do something

1282
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,920
about it

1283
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,359
then i think the whole that i think

1284
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,400
that's justification of the whole

1285
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,319
paragraph being taken out

1286
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:39,760
uh because it just doesn't have any

1287
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,359
meaning at that stage

1288
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,920
servers may look at whatever but servers

1289
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,200
may look at whatever they feel like

1290
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,240
looking at

1291
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,359
without having to say anything and uh

1292
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:52,079
and you know if they look at it they may

1293
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,400
pay attention to it and they may not

1294
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:00,319
so uh so so moving this to applicability

1295
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,559
okay are you happy with uh some text and

1296
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,920
applicability statement

1297
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,400
about this

1298
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,319
sorry i couldn't hear you are you happy

1299
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:12,799
with

1300
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,839
some text in the applicability statement

1301
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,440
about verifying oh

1302
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,799
absolutely fine

1303
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:25,599
thank you pete

1304
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,599
i just wanted to point out that todd's

1305
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,119
example isn't

1306
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,319
actually a problem for the original

1307
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:34,960
intent

1308
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,640
of this sentence because this was

1309
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,559
simply if the ip address

1310
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,920
and the name do not match in the dns

1311
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,960
that alone is not sufficient

1312
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,160
for the server to punt it the example

1313
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,799
todd gave was they didn't match and i

1314
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,480
have this information

1315
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,680
that they don't match that this

1316
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,000
is an ip address somewhere in romania

1317
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,119
and that is

1318
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,000
google's domain name right that

1319
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,160
additional piece of information

1320
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,119
is not it's not the case that google

1321
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,880
forgot to register this name

1322
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,960
this number to go with this name it's

1323
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,559
that there was a simple

1324
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,680
non-match now i think

1325
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,799
you know uh this is perfectly reasonable

1326
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,799
to pull and put in the applicability

1327
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,160
statement but

1328
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,559
there's not enough in this sentence is

1329
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:29,920
currently construed

1330
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,640
to really explain that the issue here

1331
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,760
was

1332
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,319
don't just assume that the dns is

1333
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,280
correct

1334
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,079
about names and numbers uh assume that

1335
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,760
you might be missing a separate piece of

1336
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,119
information

1337
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,680
um so but putting this in the eas and

1338
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,240
doing a fuller explanation is perfectly

1339
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,839
reasonable

1340
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,319
fine i'll let todd respond to you in

1341
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,240
case he wants to uh

1342
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,279
respond directly

1343
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,079
i i i must have misstated something

1344
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:04,559
because i

1345
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:06,319
i don't understand pete's interpretation

1346
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,839
of what i said

1347
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:11,200
um i wasn't relying on additional

1348
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,960
information there i was

1349
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,000
saying you hellowed as this name

1350
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,160
i looked up that name in the dns and

1351
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,160
that does not match the ip address from

1352
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,680
which you have connected

1353
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,000
therefore i will drop this connection

1354
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,400
romania was just a random example i

1355
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,440
threw out there could have been any

1356
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,839
consumer network or any network anywhere

1357
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,880
um but it was strictly on

1358
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,559
you gave me a name i looked up the name

1359
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,200
in the dns i did not get back at an ip

1360
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,480
address that matches where you're coming

1361
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,720
from so goodbye

1362
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:52,960
right harold

1363
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,480
just uh please don't use mail.google.com

1364
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,240
as an example

1365
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,680
if you're starting domains for

1366
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,559
mail.google.com

1367
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,760
you will find that it's there's nothing

1368
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:08,480
even remotely like a a simple reverse

1369
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:09,760
lookup

1370
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,640
now the name that google uses in e-hello

1371
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,920
is in fact

1372
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,920
something that maps back but that's

1373
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,640
probably because

1374
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,280
it spends significant time fighting with

1375
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,119
people withdraw with

1376
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,880
misguided spam skills

1377
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,000
i think uh

1378
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,960
tossing solely because of a mismatch

1379
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,240
here

1380
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:37,280
is inviting issues

1381
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,319
so no don't don't

1382
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,799
remove

1383
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,799
don't keep it at least should not at

1384
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,839
least should not

1385
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,000
alright dave

1386
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,400
so let's see if my headset will make

1387
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,640
this work better for audio

1388
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:08,319
um so peter koch uh posted a

1389
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,319
quick squib in the middle of the

1390
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,920
postings i was doing

1391
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,240
i didn't quite understand what he was

1392
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,599
referring to at the time

1393
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:17,280
and in listening to the exchange that's

1394
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,200
been going on just now

1395
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,720
whether it's what he meant or not i

1396
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,359
think it applies what he wrote was

1397
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,520
i'd suggest this confuses protocol and

1398
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,520
policy

1399
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,799
the reality is that email operations

1400
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,440
is has become complicated and varies

1401
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,039
over time

1402
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,240
and that the nature of what you're

1403
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,160
talking about right now

1404
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,640
gets into the realm of things that

1405
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,280
change

1406
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,319
over time and are not essential to the

1407
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,240
protocol specification

1408
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,400
but to the varying demands of operations

1409
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,520
and consequently

1410
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,880
considering taking actions like removing

1411
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,799
these sorts of statements

1412
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,760
that will prove to be wrong over time

1413
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,039
because they're not essential to the

1414
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:05,839
protocol

1415
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,920
they're essential to operations which is

1416
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,039
different

1417
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,480
it is something that would be worth

1418
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,240
considering since it simplifies the

1419
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,319
document quite a lot

1420
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,000
now the question is whether i will

1421
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,119
actually hear anybody

1422
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,319
uh well i i heard you so hopefully you

1423
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:24,079
hear me so thank you

1424
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,200
i do right okay so basically uh

1425
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,039
remove this text that's what you suggest

1426
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,520
from this document and move it to here

1427
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,200
i think so and and i was long-winded

1428
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,240
about it because

1429
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:38,960
it's a philosophy to doing editing on

1430
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,160
the document that

1431
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,480
will likely be very helpful in other

1432
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,480
places

1433
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,240
yeah fair enough right braun

1434
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:54,000
you have the last comment on this

1435
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,880
that was pretty much entirely covered by

1436
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,480
what dave just said there and yes

1437
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,039
that that is that is the core point and

1438
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,640
thank you peter for noticing that that

1439
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,520
it is

1440
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,319
policy rather than protocol um the

1441
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,079
behavior of the survey

1442
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,599
when verifying things and deciding

1443
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,440
whether they are valid or invalid is

1444
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,880
entirely policy

1445
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,799
and it is a good point that we should be

1446
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,160
trying to remove

1447
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,760
policy as much as possible from the

1448
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,359
protocol definition

1449
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,359
because it doesn't belong here and on on

1450
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:23,119
that grounds i say still yes we should

1451
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:23,760
remove it

1452
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,760
there's no point putting stuff in our

1453
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,799
protocol

1454
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,000
that we know people aren't going to

1455
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,640
follow um and to leave it in there even

1456
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,680
with a should

1457
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,520
is we know that people are not going to

1458
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,359
follow that should and they're not even

1459
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,880
going to want to follow that should

1460
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,480
because it's such a good signal for

1461
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,640
anti-spam in current year

1462
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,720
still and has been for the entire time

1463
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,640
i've been doing email

1464
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,760
all right okay thank you braun i think

1465
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,839
i'm hearing that

1466
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,680
obviously subject to verification on the

1467
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,880
mailing list

1468
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,960
people suggest to remove the the whole

1469
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,039
paragraph and

1470
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,319
possibly add something along this lines

1471
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,119
with should not uh or maybe even more

1472
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,000
exp

1473
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,760
and even more expanded version into the

1474
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,480
applicability statement so

1475
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,319
i think uh direction 453

1476
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,119
21 seems clearer and then we'll follow

1477
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:15,440
up

1478
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,520
on the mining list and discuss what to

1479
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,038
do with a totality statement

1480
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,960
okay moving on

1481
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,440
this is ticket number one about use of

1482
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,640
ip addresses

1483
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,319
in hello um

1484
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:41,440
we had various discussion on this people

1485
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,079
uh some people say that

1486
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,960
it should be syntactically uh invalid

1487
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,079
and deprecated

1488
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,119
and other uh

1489
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,480
in particular for iot cases think that

1490
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,680
it should be

1491
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,960
still allowed and sounds

1492
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,000
like we need at minimum some text in

1493
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,079
applicability statement about this

1494
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:11,598
so comments please

1495
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,839
beat

1496
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,440
i'll try and channel keith since he's

1497
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,559
not here

1498
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,240
for the moment and say syntactically

1499
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,039
it seems reasonable to leave it in even

1500
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,240
though uh

1501
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,720
harkening back to our last discussion by

1502
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,760
policy

1503
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,760
it might be quite reasonable to reject a

1504
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,599
whole bunch of these things

1505
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,039
um but there are iot cases there are

1506
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:42,480
other cases where you want to say

1507
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,760
by policy i'm going to allow

1508
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,960
an ip address literal because

1509
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,200
this is a space where i really can't use

1510
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,559
domain names in a legitimate way

1511
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:57,280
so i think protocol wise it's okay to

1512
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,000
leave it in

1513
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
and um policy wise it's okay to say

1514
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,200
nope not accepting those okay

1515
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,399
thank you john

1516
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,079
take that a little further uh i'm i'm

1517
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,359
seeing

1518
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:17,359
uh still seeing a number of uh of smtp

1519
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,120
clients that uh that we describe as iot

1520
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,880
devices today but uh but we're designed

1521
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,640
to build long before the term iot

1522
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,040
came into fashion and some of which are

1523
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,799
pretty big objects

1524
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,839
uh using ip addresses because

1525
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:38,319
they are uh using smtp to send

1526
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,759
uh um messages of once

1527
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,560
or another to uh local servers

1528
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,799
um uh and and don't have access dns and

1529
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,880
don't even speak dnx

1530
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,080
um and uh and before those things get to

1531
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,040
the

1532
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,880
get past the the the relay the first

1533
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,000
relay

1534
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,359
uh they're using the relays domain name

1535
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:06,799
so they're not showing up on the public

1536
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,880
internet they're showing up in

1537
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,839
land and land-like and isolated

1538
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,839
network-like environments

1539
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,080
uh but they're using ip addresses

1540
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,600
because they don't have any choice

1541
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,679
and and that's of course the reason why

1542
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,359
we retained ip addresses

1543
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,399
into 2821 because we had a piece of this

1544
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:25,600
discussion

1545
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:29,359
back at that point so uh

1546
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,880
um uh anything in the af

1547
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,120
which says that ip addresses in the

1548
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,399
public internet

1549
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:39,520
are probably a bad idea i think is fine

1550
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,158
but as far as 5321 is concerned i don't

1551
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,439
think it's healthy to make a change

1552
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:49,839
okay sounds good any other comments

1553
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,480
so looks like with this ticket we have

1554
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,080
no change for 53 21 this and

1555
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,280
uh various checks suggested for

1556
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,960
for the applicability statement and

1557
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,400
we'll discuss it on the mining list

1558
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,839
okay next ticket

1559
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,800
quoted strings and escaping um

1560
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,560
john would you like to present this or

1561
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,840
would you like me to talk about this

1562
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,280
i uh i guess i'll say some things about

1563
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,040
it

1564
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,960
um um i've uh

1565
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,199
i've seen implementations in which all

1566
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:46,080
of these things

1567
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,320
are considered equivalent i've seen

1568
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,760
implementations which they're

1569
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,080
not uh this uh this interacts with

1570
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,360
the 5322 question about

1571
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,880
uh about quoted strings

1572
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,080
although uh that particular question is

1573
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,159
much narrower than this

1574
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,719
and uh and i think there's an argument

1575
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,239
for figuring out what it is we meant in

1576
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,080
narrowing it down

1577
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,920
uh even if we end up saying that um

1578
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,040
uh that uh

1579
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,280
there's some legacy things out here and

1580
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,679
uh and servers better be prepared for

1581
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:24,480
them

1582
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,440
uh i think the uh the combination of

1583
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,040
operational experience

1584
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,159
and uh and an argument for clarity

1585
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,480
are used for uh for looking at this

1586
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,280
again

1587
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,640
in the most extreme case uh we

1588
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,120
may want to start deprecating some of

1589
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,120
these combinations because

1590
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,920
uh they just cause confusion the other

1591
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,239
part of the story here

1592
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,120
is we've got a history of uh of

1593
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,960
operating systems getting hold of these

1594
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,360
things

1595
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,880
after the users put them in and deciding

1596
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:57,679
that

1597
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,080
some quote characters but not others are

1598
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,120
the uh

1599
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,040
are the property operating system

1600
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,239
designating

1601
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,360
local symbols and things like that and

1602
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:07,760
as

1603
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,199
they then try to apply those rules uh

1604
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,719
things get very very confused uh

1605
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,640
that may be an applicability statement

1606
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,560
issue but it's probably not something we

1607
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,840
should ignore

1608
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,239
all right comments

1609
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,040
i should add that i don't know how to

1610
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,159
fix it i'm just identifying the problem

1611
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,560
well um there is i i switched to the

1612
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,880
second slide and there is a bit

1613
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,199
a part of the proposal how how to go

1614
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,840
about it so i think which is fair

1615
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,840
um

1616
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,560
so anybody else wants to yeah that that

1617
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,640
uh that um that comment on the second

1618
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,760
slide is right

1619
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,679
and i think that's one we can get our

1620
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:04,960
hands on

1621
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,000
the various combinations of blanks and

1622
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,840
uh and slashes within quoted strings

1623
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,719
i'm uh i'm more worried about in terms

1624
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:15,120
of

1625
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,600
uh of not knowing of not knowing what

1626
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,440
the right solutions are

1627
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,480
uh but i've seen some of this stuff

1628
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,600
in the wild um

1629
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,520
uh be caught in in one historical case

1630
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,880
because that's what the operations

1631
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,920
required uh because that was how

1632
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:35,679
usernames worked

1633
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,880
uh but um but more often

1634
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,679
in a uh in a strange kind of security by

1635
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:43,040
obscurity

1636
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,480
sort of thing because uh the uh

1637
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,320
the spammers don't know this cut these

1638
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,480
combinations spammers and fishers don't

1639
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,199
know these kind of

1640
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:54,560
kinds of combinations exist and uh

1641
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,760
and consequently putting them into a uh

1642
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,719
a mailbox name is a uh is a way of

1643
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,239
keeping noise down

1644
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,040
but i i don't think that's a very strong

1645
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,760
justification

1646
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,880
right pete was commenting in java saying

1647
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,040
hopefully how to fix doesn't include any

1648
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,320
changes to quoted string syntaxes

1649
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:20,400
5322 i think there is no proposal to

1650
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,199
change

1651
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,839
syntax

1652
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,239
well almost yeah i think uh that

1653
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,400
shouldn't affect 53 22.

1654
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,199
yeah i'm i'm i i'm not sure there there

1655
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:37,440
may be some syntax productions

1656
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,199
that we either need to change or we need

1657
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,120
to make some explicit statements

1658
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,920
about what what's equal and not equal to

1659
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,760
various other things

1660
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,600
uh because the way these quarter streets

1661
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,199
get messed with

1662
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:52,239
they uh they may be an exception to the

1663
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:53,040
rule that

1664
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,400
uh that nobody but uh

1665
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,480
but the delivery server configurations

1666
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,840
figure out what an address means

1667
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,480
right um so yeah this is the sort of the

1668
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,639
second part of the proposal is saying

1669
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,320
that

1670
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:12,640
if people want to compare this we need

1671
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,239
to say uh

1672
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,360
probably be more clear about this

1673
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,880
i'm sure there are lots of bugs in this

1674
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,840
area

1675
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,880
so anybody else wants to talk about this

1676
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,239
i know this issue is not very fleshed

1677
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,120
out so

1678
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,400
maybe we'll i'll try to

1679
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,320
do a straw man proposal on the mailing

1680
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,759
list and then everybody can hate it

1681
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,800
it may be useful let's see to separate

1682
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:49,920
those uh

1683
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,880
those two possible resolution paragraphs

1684
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,199
from

1685
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,560
each other because the first one seems

1686
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,960
pretty obvious to me and it's reasonably

1687
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,320
well fleshed out

1688
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,440
and the second one is hand waving maybe

1689
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:07,839
important hand waving but at the moment

1690
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,840
okay um do you think we need a separate

1691
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:12,560
issue for

1692
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,640
the second one or just just

1693
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,480
you know if you want to get the first

1694
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,480
one resolved then moving the second one

1695
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,840
is a separate issue is probably a good

1696
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,080
thing

1697
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,960
okay it depends on how you feel about

1698
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,080
half resolved issues

1699
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,199
um okay if we can minute that maybe

1700
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:38,080
create a second

1701
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,840
um second issue about comparison uh

1702
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,199
that would be good right

1703
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,520
um if there are no further comments on

1704
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,480
this let's move on

1705
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,400
right empty quarter string and 5322 um

1706
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,800
this is we had a long discussion on this

1707
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,840
last time

1708
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,960
um i think where we landed

1709
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,280
is uh we shouldn't change syntax

1710
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,239
but applicability statement need to talk

1711
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,920
about

1712
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,760
where it's okay and not okay to have

1713
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,800
empty quote strings

1714
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,080
so i just wanted to

1715
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,560
have a bit of a feedback on

1716
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,239
what might go into applicability

1717
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:36,400
statement and this is the next slide

1718
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:45,839
so this um

1719
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,599
yes john

1720
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,719
pushing this bas is okay we just need to

1721
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:53,920
make certain

1722
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:56,239
that we're sufficiently coordinated that

1723
01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:56,960
uh

1724
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,239
that five three two two oh

1725
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,400
does not end up prohibiting anything

1726
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,839
that five three two one allows

1727
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:12,480
right yes there is

1728
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:16,799
right so um beat

1729
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,000
um given how much 5322 allows

1730
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,360
it would be hard to imagine anything

1731
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,719
five three two one

1732
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,120
would allow would not be in five three

1733
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,920
two two

1734
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,640
um this makes me perfectly happy because

1735
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,880
it's less work for me so

1736
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:41,199
you will get no objection from my end

1737
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,520
all right so i'm looking at this slide

1738
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,800
specifically and

1739
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,199
maybe you want you want to stay online

1740
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,440
um

1741
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,239
i did a bit of research about where

1742
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,839
quoted strings are allowed

1743
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,199
i think the obvious case where

1744
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:05,120
it's okay is display name

1745
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,600
in uh name construction

1746
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,600
i think uh it probably going to cause

1747
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,199
practical issue in local parts probably

1748
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,320
in receive tokens and keywords i don't

1749
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,159
know how many people are using keyboards

1750
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,600
uh but does this

1751
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,719
look roughly

1752
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,840
correct

1753
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,280
and when i say cannot be empty uh that

1754
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,120
will go to applicability statement so

1755
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,719
this index will allow it but

1756
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,360
uh we'll just add text saying that

1757
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,839
certain things are not a good idea

1758
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:01,520
i'm gonna defer to anyone who might have

1759
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,719
operational experience here because

1760
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,239
all of these things seem perfectly

1761
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:08,880
reasonable but

1762
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,000
i don't have a strong opinion

1763
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,320
do you think it will help to create some

1764
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
test messages and post them somewhere

1765
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,120
and ask people to

1766
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,080
um you know use milk lines to display

1767
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,840
them and see if they crush and burn

1768
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,520
what damage it does to their male

1769
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,000
clients yeah um

1770
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,679
yeah we we could do that and you know

1771
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:33,280
we can do a little testing i'm sure

1772
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,320
people would be amused

1773
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,120
john it seems to me

1774
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,120
and this becomes entirely appropriate

1775
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,400
for the as

1776
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,000
but it seems to me that what a lot of

1777
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,840
this stuff is about is a

1778
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,360
uh uh is a warning that uh

1779
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,320
that some of these constructions are uh

1780
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,320
are not likely to work

1781
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,440
in in the general case and uh and if you

1782
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,239
create mailboxes that look like this

1783
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:05,120
uh in in local parts and things like

1784
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,239
that

1785
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,440
um that uh that it's not gonna work and

1786
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,239
unless you

1787
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,840
uh in the again in the general case and

1788
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,159
operationally

1789
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,360
and if uh if what you want is for it

1790
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,400
not to work in many cases because it's

1791
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,280
obscure the

1792
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,120
journey is deliberate then that's a

1793
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,760
whole issue a whole different issue

1794
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,760
but but i don't know

1795
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,960
how much else you could say about that

1796
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,000
and uh and of course the decision we

1797
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,360
made earlier

1798
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,480
moves the question of most receipt token

1799
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,920
question about this into uh into an 821

1800
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,280
issue

1801
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,239
and uh and pete is correct that a22

1802
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,320
permits

1803
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,480
uh the 5322 permits almost anything that

1804
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,719
uh that one could possibly imagine and

1805
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,000
maybe in this case that's okay

1806
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,880
but keywords keywords are particularly

1807
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,320
important here

1808
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,960
because the purpose of using keywords is

1809
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,360
to

1810
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,239
uh is to have something which works and

1811
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,440
is comparable

1812
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,560
and uh and if you use these things

1813
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:25,840
then it may not

1814
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,440
okay so it seems to uh that you are

1815
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,159
roughly

1816
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:33,440
agreeing with uh

1817
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,880
preliminary analysis on the slide but

1818
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,400
obviously the devil is in details

1819
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:53,840
yeah okay brawn

1820
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,520
stuff um the one thing as

1821
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,480
i guess an end user of this stuff is it

1822
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,440
would be nice to have guidance on

1823
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,159
this stuff is very likely to work and

1824
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,520
hereby dragons don't

1825
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,199
mess around here so things like

1826
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,679
using empty strings or using lots of

1827
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:14,719
specially quoted

1828
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,560
stuff in your local part is likely to

1829
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,639
break things whereas if you stick within

1830
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:20,320
this set of characters and this set of

1831
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,040
behavior

1832
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,480
then you can expect everything to

1833
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,400
interoperate and at

1834
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,840
it's really at the stage where you are

1835
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,639
then talking to whoever's receiving your

1836
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,320
email or sending your email or your

1837
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,199
providers

1838
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:33,840
up and down stream and saying to them

1839
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,840
hey you're not behaving properly here's

1840
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,080
what the rfc says you should do this

1841
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,719
um and we we need to cut a line where we

1842
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:41,280
say

1843
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,880
things in this area should be expected

1844
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,280
to work things in this area uh

1845
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,719
you're you're playing in dangerous

1846
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,040
territory and i think having

1847
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,760
defining that edge somewhere is valuable

1848
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,000
and saying it's it's just all undefined

1849
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,320
you anything might work anything might

1850
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,960
not work isn't useful to anybody

1851
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,280
um right i'd like to see some kind of

1852
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,800
his the things that are generally

1853
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,840
considered to be safe

1854
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,719
i think we'll still really still do this

1855
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:09,679
an applicability

1856
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,880
statement yeah um but yeah certainly

1857
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:16,159
having having a pretty strong plus plus

1858
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:19,280
is expected in a local part and if your

1859
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,800
web form doesn't allow someone to enter

1860
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:23,040
that it's not accepting email addresses

1861
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:27,040
but double back quoted empty white space

1862
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,239
is not expected to work and if you make

1863
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,440
this your local part and

1864
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,120
it's not accepted in a web form then you

1865
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,360
get to keep both the broken pieces

1866
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,120
right okay

1867
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:45,840
thank you

1868
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,639
right moving on i'm changing um

1869
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,639
to something slightly different

1870
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,600
um this is a issue about closing

1871
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,800
connections

1872
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,840
uh ticket number 46

1873
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,320
uh and what the expected client behavior

1874
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,639
is

1875
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,840
um

1876
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:18,080
so there was a suggestion that um

1877
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,239
to clarify on the assumption that the

1878
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:21,840
client will receive it after the next

1879
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,800
command is issued

1880
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,840
um

1881
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,360
by suggesting or read it before closing

1882
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,239
the connection

1883
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:40,320
at its side

1884
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,280
this text probably not that i'll look at

1885
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,280
it it probably can be improved but

1886
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:55,840
comment suggestions about this

1887
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,159
uh i'll do whatever the working group

1888
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,600
decides and wants to do

1889
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,639
but uh but i'm still not convinced that

1890
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,239
there's a real problem here

1891
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:19,360
and uh uh and if the working you've

1892
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,600
decided it wants changes

1893
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,400
then i think we should put in something

1894
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,280
resembling

1895
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:30,960
a uh a specific example of a case where

1896
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,000
where where where this is relevant

1897
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,400
yeah actually i do have a slide showing

1898
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,080
how clients typically work

1899
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,080
so if it helps people to sort of

1900
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:42,400
understand the issue um

1901
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,239
i can flip to that barry

1902
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,239
if you want to say something oh wait to

1903
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,639
see your slide

1904
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:52,719
um i think a non-blocking client is

1905
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:54,159
probably

1906
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:57,520
the most obvious so basically the order

1907
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,239
of event

1908
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:02,480
is server rights photo one shutting down

1909
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,000
and close its side of the connection

1910
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,520
gracefully

1911
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,360
then client decides to send some

1912
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,600
commands at a later point

1913
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,199
um and then it this is

1914
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:15,679
uh using non-blocking sockets so the

1915
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:18,000
client use paul or e paul on unix

1916
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,960
or any other kind of similar event

1917
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,639
framework

1918
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:24,239
to wait for read and write events and

1919
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,080
close events and

1920
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,000
this will complete immediately and the

1921
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,040
client will get

1922
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,400
the text sent by the server before it

1923
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,480
gets notified the connection got closed

1924
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,120
so

1925
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,360
actually client already have it in its

1926
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,440
tcp buffer

1927
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,600
the closing message from the server in

1928
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,520
some cases

1929
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,280
so um i think the suggestion behind the

1930
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:49,760
text

1931
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,360
was just to make it clear that

1932
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,679
it's okay and maybe even a good idea to

1933
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,440
do this sort of thing

1934
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:01,199
not just because the original text

1935
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,239
uh seems to suggest that

1936
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,559
um

1937
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,239
client will receive this information

1938
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,320
after sending a command but actually the

1939
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,760
client has already received this

1940
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,239
information

1941
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:27,520
barry so

1942
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,639
yeah i'm kind of with john i don't um

1943
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,280
i i don't think the text really needs to

1944
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:33,760
be

1945
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,520
fixed here i think uh this is stuff

1946
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,000
for the applicability statement to um

1947
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,320
discuss in more detail how clients

1948
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:44,159
should handle this

1949
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:48,080
but that what's in 5321 now

1950
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,440
is okay i think that

1951
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,000
um i haven't submitted this ticket i'm

1952
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,120
just trying to proxy

1953
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,440
there whoever submitted it i think the

1954
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,239
current text

1955
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:00,639
seems to be can be read as prohibiting

1956
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:01,760
this behavior where

1957
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,360
it's quite common actually in clients

1958
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,600
i don't read the current text as

1959
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,960
prohibiting this

1960
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,000
so if people think that then

1961
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,760
yeah maybe we do need to tweak the text

1962
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,840
anybody else

1963
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,239
john

1964
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,280
barry i don't read the current texas

1965
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,639
prohibiting this this is uh

1966
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,360
this is an operational detail about how

1967
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,320
the uh

1968
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,600
the client behaves and your uh

1969
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,679
your example is making a lot of

1970
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,040
assumptions about

1971
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:55,120
uh how the client interacts with the tcp

1972
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,159
interface on image and that's

1973
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:01,600
uh that ought to be

1974
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,920
i think um sufficiently lower level to

1975
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,560
not be in scope for five three two one

1976
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,760
but uh uh and and as i say i don't think

1977
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,600
the text prohibits this but if

1978
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,520
uh if other people are reading his

1979
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:21,840
prohibition then it already patched

1980
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,120
other hand i don't think that the

1981
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,560
proposed fix patches it

1982
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,840
i mean i don't think it makes any

1983
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,320
difference

1984
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,600
at least not in how i interpret the text

1985
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,600
yeah i don't either

1986
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,800
right um okay and

1987
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,000
similar related issue is again

1988
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,199
i i think it's the same um

1989
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:51,120
same type of issue in another paragraph

1990
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,239
um whether the client

1991
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:59,040
can read what it already received uh

1992
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,440
before interpreting it as photo one in

1993
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,040
case the server sends a more specific

1994
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,400
other

1995
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:17,839
response code

1996
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:26,480
it strikes me that we're trying to

1997
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,719
tell people how to deal with transport

1998
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:30,880
layer issues

1999
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,719
and i understand that somebody writing

2000
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,400
an smtp client

2001
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,239
might not understand how to deal with

2002
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:40,080
transport layer issues

2003
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,719
but i'm not sure that 5321 is the right

2004
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,679
place to do that

2005
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:49,280
fine okay so um

2006
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,960
wrong

2007
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,520
do you need to say about dealing with

2008
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,440
transport layer issues is when you

2009
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,040
should retry when you should

2010
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,199
back off when you should assume that the

2011
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:04,880
message went through i think defining

2012
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,600
those

2013
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,000
really clearly is good um otherwise i

2014
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,639
agree with barry

2015
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,840
i agree that uh saying when retries are

2016
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:14,800
appropriate is

2017
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,880
is definitely in scope for this yeah

2018
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,040
i i agree with that but but

2019
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:24,800
uh but i completely agree with barry's

2020
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,159
comment we're uh

2021
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:29,040
we're really messing around in not not

2022
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,280
only in transport layer issues

2023
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:33,840
but in the issue of of the local uh

2024
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,800
communication

2025
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,400
between the client and the transport

2026
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,000
layer and i don't think we want to go

2027
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,840
there if we can possibly avoid it

2028
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,840
all right uh let me try to have a follow

2029
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,159
up on this issue on the mailing list

2030
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,639
if we can come up with some possible

2031
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:53,520
text for the applicability statement

2032
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,719
well uh but at this point it looks like

2033
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:00,719
no change four fifty three twenty one

2034
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,560
i'd be pretty hesitant about getting

2035
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,400
very far into this

2036
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,280
in the applicability statement as well

2037
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,320
again

2038
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,159
because these not only transport layer

2039
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:11,440
issues but

2040
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,320
their uh their issues in in the local

2041
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:14,960
systems

2042
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:18,000
model in the local systems client

2043
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,120
systems model

2044
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:21,440
of how one interacts with transport and

2045
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,800
uh

2046
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,280
as i say go going there seems to be

2047
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,120
hazardous

2048
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:30,239
um yeah i'm i'm looking at this i'm just

2049
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,679
trying to figure out whether

2050
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,520
uh documenting this makes a difference

2051
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,679
and the um hypothetical situation

2052
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,760
is if the server returns completely

2053
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,040
different error code

2054
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,639
response code here like 5xx

2055
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:49,199
uh but then we need to figure out you

2056
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,000
know

2057
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,159
is it going to affect um

2058
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,719
clients basically you understand where

2059
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,159
you're coming from and why

2060
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:05,360
but uh but i also have memories of

2061
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,719
uh of the time when we had uh

2062
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,800
smtp running over things besides tcp

2063
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,920
and uh and the possible situation the

2064
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,239
future where with the

2065
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:22,639
advent of of non-tcp transport protocols

2066
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:25,840
we may have smtp running over

2067
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,600
over non-tcp again and

2068
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,960
and getting way down at the issues of

2069
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,320
of how tcp implementations uh

2070
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:39,440
behave or appear to be in a uh

2071
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,480
in a given client environment uh seems

2072
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,119
to be fraught with risks that we could

2073
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,840
clarify this in a way which makes things

2074
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,800
more difficult

2075
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,280
for uh for future implementations in a

2076
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,119
way which we don't want to

2077
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:56,560
so i again i uh

2078
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,520
uh if we're gonna do something here i

2079
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:01,199
think it needs to be illustrated

2080
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,440
with specific examples and i think we

2081
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,480
need to be

2082
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,080
very careful that we're not making more

2083
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,000
assumptions about the uh

2084
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,719
the transport layer than we need to and

2085
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:11,920
uh and that's

2086
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,719
definitely true in uh in five three two

2087
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:16,880
one this is probably true

2088
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,920
even in the as

2089
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,840
all right

2090
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:33,119
let me think how to approach this ticket

2091
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,159
uh i

2092
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:36,080
i can completely understand that people

2093
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,159
fail to get excited about it so

2094
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:42,080
um oh i'm excited about this just not

2095
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,800
excitedly

2096
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,920
likely to be excited

2097
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,000
i i have uh i had similar

2098
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,679
coding issues you know trying to

2099
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:55,040
implement my client that's why i'm

2100
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:55,760
trying to

2101
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,920
do a fairer presentation trying to proxy

2102
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:06,239
this issue but anyway moving on

2103
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,800
all right um we have this right

2104
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,639
um i think

2105
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:20,000
let's get some coffee in and

2106
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,440
talk about five five two walk around uh

2107
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:28,320
todd are you happy to talk about this

2108
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,159
ticket

2109
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:33,679
sure um

2110
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:36,239
the ticket as i understand it is

2111
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:37,360
discussing

2112
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:40,639
removing the bolded uh

2113
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,520
sentence there um client should treat a

2114
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,360
552 code in this case is temporary

2115
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:46,719
rather than permanent failure so the

2116
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:48,639
logic balloon works

2117
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:51,520
um there was some discussion on the list

2118
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,159
several

2119
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:55,759
folks posted uh

2120
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,760
what they found in various open source

2121
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:00,080
packages i believe that they all said

2122
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,199
that they

2123
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:04,639
treated 552 as a permanent failure um

2124
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,159
i reached out to several large mailbox

2125
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,320
providers and a couple of commercial mta

2126
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,040
vendors

2127
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:13,840
not everybody responded but google

2128
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,000
microsoft and proofpoint all said they

2129
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,000
treat 552 as a permanent failure

2130
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,080
so while the recommendation clearly says

2131
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,080
client should treat it as temporary it

2132
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:24,960
seems that

2133
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,119
most clients are not doing so um

2134
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:31,280
so the question then becomes do we leave

2135
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,119
this text in there and hope

2136
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,760
that people change their code or do we

2137
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,239
strike it

2138
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:45,440
i'll open the floor to john

2139
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,480
clarify um as far as we know no

2140
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,480
client is actually following this

2141
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:54,000
recommendation is this correct

2142
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,920
i want it right yeah i do not recall

2143
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,560
seeing any i i just reviewed the the

2144
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,080
thread that's called out

2145
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,199
in the ticket a few minutes ago

2146
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,360
i don't recall seeing any any mention in

2147
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,400
there that anybody was

2148
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,679
treating it as a temporary failure um

2149
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:13,199
and i have not heard directly from

2150
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,800
anybody saying that they treat it as a

2151
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,719
temporary feeling i have not done an

2152
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:18,239
exhaustive

2153
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,760
um survey of every possible mta vendor

2154
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:22,639
out there obviously

2155
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:26,080
but i have not yet heard that anybody is

2156
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:29,040
treating it as a temporary failure

2157
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,880
john i

2158
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,159
posted a note to the list um some hours

2159
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:37,440
ago

2160
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,280
uh that that suggested not only is this

2161
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,080
statement

2162
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,560
not useful because nobody's paying any

2163
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,760
attention to it

2164
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,880
but it may be wrong um so

2165
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,400
uh so that's a probably an additional

2166
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:55,599
reason for getting rid of it

2167
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,760
okay sounds good brawn

2168
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,679
oh braun just removed himself but brown

2169
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:13,840
if you want to

2170
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,679
okay so maybe uh

2171
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,000
i suggest maybe we have sort of like a

2172
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,520
mini working group last call on this

2173
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,880
issue

2174
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,679
uh asking for any objections and then

2175
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:29,679
proposal is just to drop this sentence

2176
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:40,320
all right

2177
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,920
okay moving on to the next one again

2178
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,040
for you todd yes

2179
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,440
um this is another one where i've

2180
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,159
reached out to

2181
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:51,280
the same mailbox providers and

2182
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:52,960
commercial mta vendors i have not yet

2183
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,000
heard any responses

2184
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,239
back they they get they get to me when

2185
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:57,199
they get to me

2186
01:39:57,199 --> 01:40:00,400
um so that i think

2187
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:01,760
definitely this warrants further

2188
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,080
discussion uh those

2189
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,159
timeouts do seem

2190
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,800
uh to coin a phrase from a different

2191
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:11,840
time

2192
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,679
i think they are probably um

2193
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:18,719
far longer than they need to be but i

2194
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:20,560
think we need to

2195
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,600
get some actual verification um from

2196
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:24,960
current implementations to see what

2197
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,960
they're doing before we

2198
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,280
um go forward and make any changes here

2199
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,520
because we don't want to

2200
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:32,960
we don't want to change data termination

2201
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,239
to say two minutes and then find out

2202
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:35,520
somebody is actually waiting 10 minutes

2203
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,840
to do it

2204
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:43,280
but anyway uh alexi you're in the queue

2205
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,840
and then okay john

2206
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,400
flagler is an opinion we should uh

2207
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:59,679
should also reach out not just to uh

2208
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,159
uh things we consider ordinary email

2209
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:03,280
clients

2210
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,040
but the dtn people because uh

2211
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:10,800
if the uh if if if either the client or

2212
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,119
server is on the moon or on the mark

2213
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:16,880
and uh and the other one is uh

2214
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,480
is earthbound uh change

2215
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,920
numbers may not be appropriate um

2216
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,360
again um not not not opposed to making

2217
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:28,880
changes here but if we're

2218
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,719
uh if we're making a decision on the

2219
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,560
basis of what uh

2220
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,760
what implementations might do then uh

2221
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,520
uh then dtn situations with uh

2222
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,239
with pipelining may be something or are

2223
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:43,600
something we need to make certain we

2224
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,000
don't

2225
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,119
uh mess up my excerpt

2226
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,760
should that make sense john do you have

2227
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,880
some specific

2228
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,679
do you know who to contact on this and i

2229
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:56,560
are you happy to do that

2230
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,400
uh not anymore but i think i know who to

2231
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,679
ask and his name is serv

2232
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:08,000
but there's still a dtn but i think

2233
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,400
there's still a dtn working group or

2234
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:14,480
or yes there is yeah and uh and that

2235
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,159
would be the logical place to start

2236
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:28,719
all right braun

2237
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:31,280
my question again in here is is there

2238
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:33,920
any value in reducing the timeouts

2239
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:36,960
um generally if you're building a server

2240
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,000
that needs to deal with

2241
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,560
a lot of traffic it can already spend

2242
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,400
very little research resources in

2243
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,239
holding open a tcp connection while it's

2244
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,239
waiting for things to happen down at

2245
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:49,280
um what's the alternative

2246
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,800
basically why not leave them this big

2247
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:54,560
and then that gives you more capability

2248
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,000
to deal with transient issues

2249
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,679
like high disk load or whatever on the

2250
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,400
receiving end

2251
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:07,119
yeah that's perfectly valid i i you know

2252
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,159
if the intent here

2253
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:12,400
is to reflect reality

2254
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,360
um there maybe needs to change but if

2255
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,960
the intent here is just to recommend

2256
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,480
values that cover the cases

2257
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,639
you're you're referring to brawn and

2258
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,400
maybe leaving it as is

2259
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,320
this is the right move i think just

2260
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,840
further discussion

2261
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,880
and and you know reach out to the dtn

2262
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,960
folks and others to find out what

2263
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,080
they're doing right now to

2264
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:36,239
to try to inform that discussion

2265
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,080
john

2266
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,320
i just when i think i've earned the

2267
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,119
combination

2268
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:49,520
of uh of bronze bronze comment and yours

2269
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:53,040
uh plus or minus adding in the uh

2270
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:56,719
the gtn question is that uh we probably

2271
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:59,520
should not be looking at 5321 about this

2272
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:02,159
we should probably be looking at uh how

2273
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:04,159
to construct a nice paragraph or two in

2274
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:05,280
the as

2275
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,480
talking about the issues and the

2276
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,400
trade-offs and what people are doing

2277
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,760
under various circumstances but

2278
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:21,679
just the thought

2279
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,600
right um

2280
01:44:26,720 --> 01:44:28,960
[Music]

2281
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:35,119
yeah i mean i don't

2282
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:38,080
the language in the spec right now says

2283
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:38,560
uh

2284
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,639
the minimum per command timeout value

2285
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,480
should be as follows

2286
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:43,679
so there are only recommendations

2287
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:45,760
there's no

2288
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,119
there's no structure here with

2289
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:50,480
with them nobody can claim you're

2290
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:54,000
violating an rfc if you shut down

2291
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,760
you know after say three minutes instead

2292
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,040
of five whatever

2293
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,159
um so perhaps the applicability

2294
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,600
statement

2295
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,199
is a better place to discuss this entire

2296
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:04,880
topic

2297
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,800
we don't we have we don't have any any

2298
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,639
on-list discussion of this topic or

2299
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:12,560
is really anything in the ticket um

2300
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,040
to guide us yet so

2301
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:20,560
let's um

2302
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,800
i think just move forward with further

2303
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,280
discussion on this and see where

2304
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,960
what the consensus emerges as to where

2305
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,159
where to take this

2306
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:30,440

2307

[Music]

2308
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:35,679
that there haven't really been any

2309
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,000
complaints about the current values

2310
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,239
um which to take us right back to those

2311
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:42,320
comments from ages ago

2312
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,760
maybe we shouldn't be changing this at

2313
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:44,960
all because it's not an area that's

2314
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,159
causing problems with the current specs

2315
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:58,080
that's fair

2316
01:45:58,080 --> 01:46:01,119
uh anyone else have anything to say on

2317
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:03,599
this topic

2318
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:14,400
okay lucky i'll turn it back to you

2319
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:19,920
yeah i i was actually optimistic i

2320
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,159
didn't expect us to use uh

2321
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:25,520
two hours but they're nearly there

2322
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:29,280
i think that's the last uh

2323
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:33,040
last issue that uh

2324
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,840
i was really prepared to talk about to

2325
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,280
be honest so

2326
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,480
let's have a quick

2327
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:43,600
section for other other issues questions

2328
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:48,560
that people want to raise and

2329
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:52,840
if not then we'll finish a few minutes

2330
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,840
early

2331
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,239
okay

2332
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:11,839
going once going twice

2333
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,520
okay um i think we're done then um thank

2334
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,639
you

2335
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:20,719
all very much for showing up and

2336
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,560
i think we made some progress or at

2337
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,960
least uh pointed out directions for

2338
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:25,920
various tickets

2339
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,660
uh and

[Music]

2341
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,760
well uh then i will hope to see you on

2342
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,600
the mailing list and

2343
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,840
get get these documents done

2344
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:51,840
so thank you all

2345
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:05,600
thank you and i'm less depressed now

2346
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,960
than i was when i started the meeting

2347
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,679
which is rare

2348
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:18,880
