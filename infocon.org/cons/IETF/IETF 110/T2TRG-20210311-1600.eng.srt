1
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,920
welcome to the thing to think research

2
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
group meeting

3
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,480
so i'm wondering what the arrival

4
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,559
distribution is

5
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,839
this time

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
let's do it coming in by the virtual

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
door

8
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,840
sorry i'm late

9
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,399
okay we have waited two two minutes

10
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:08,959
which is

11
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
the half of the official

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,319
ietf four minute uh

13
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,319
standard delay but let's start anyway

14
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,480
um so this is the thing to sing research

15
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,840
group

16
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,959
um custom bowman is me

17
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,520
ari karen is there as well or can you

18
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,200
show your video because i don't have

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
video this week because my

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,879
wife has the video capable set up for

21
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,679
doing exams

22
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,800
and also coroner has reduced my

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
capabilities of doing videos so

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
i think the final study

25
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,440
yeah okay it's um

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,120
try testing screen sharing but it

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,800
wouldn't let me in the test setup so

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
hopefully it works

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
yeah you need a chair to to enable the

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
screen sharing so the two bits

31
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,519
we weren't there when when you test it

32
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,599
it will work and otherwise i have a

33
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,760
backup

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,760
okay so i need to do the slide advancing

35
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
in the right window

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
um this is my version of the node

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,319
slide which tells you that you may be

38
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,560
recorded rightly you are being recorded

39
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,920
we try to be nice and professional and

40
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
the ipr guidelines the

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,319
intellectual property rights if you like

42
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,280
that term

43
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,080
guidelines of the itf apply

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,879
so you can go to the link shown there to

45
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
find out more details

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,879
but there's actually a long version of

47
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
that which you all

48
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,200
are reading and understanding now so i

49
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,680
can

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
move forward uh to code of conduct and

51
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,799
anti-harassment

52
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,400
and so on and okay so that should be the

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
the formal

54
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,280
part let's quickly talk about the

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,319
the goal of this meeting and of the iitf

56
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,640
in in general the irtf is a parallel

57
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
organization to the ietf

58
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,358
which focuses on longer-term research

59
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,320
issues

60
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
related to the internet so the ietf

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
creates standards and

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,320
and we hopefully create good research or

63
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,040
helped

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,600
create good research we are not doing

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,560
standards

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
here and um

67
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,199
yeah there is an rfc where you can

68
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
read more about that

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,800
so who are our note takers today

70
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,919
there is a cody md which is on on the

71
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
slide

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
yeah so i'll be taking notes to you so

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
but everyone feel free to join the kodi

74
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,639
md

75
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,560
and chime in on the note-taking

76
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,600
okay we currently have four people in in

77
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
that

78
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
cody md so a few more would be nice

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,360
there is a jabber which is also visible

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
as the

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,400
meat echo chat on the left side

82
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,280
of the screen

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,960
um we have a mailing list and we also

84
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,560
have a repository

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,240
for each meeting so in the github

86
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,240
organization tjrg

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,440
you find repositories for each meeting

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
and some additional repositories

89
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
and the one for this meeting is as

90
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
convention

91
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,400
conventionally called 2021-iitf 110.

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,960
so looks at let's look at the agenda

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,880
intro stuff is what what i'm doing right

94
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,919
now

95
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,520
uh there will be a couple of reports

96
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,000
from various activities including wishy

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,919
and and the asd asdf rishi hackathon

98
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,759
we just had and then we will have

99
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,160
updates from various organizations this

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,280
time

101
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,720
from w3 3c web of things

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,880
and from 1dm one data model

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,400
and at 1650 utc we will actually move to

104
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,080
uh contributions michael richardson will

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,840
talk about the taxonomy of operational

106
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,720
security

107
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,039
savvy will talk about progress in the

108
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,560
iot edge

109
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,319
document which already is a research

110
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,400
group document so we hope to

111
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
publish this one shown soon

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,360
and mohit will talk about the

113
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,560
bootstrapping terminology which

114
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
has been around 10 years now it just had

115
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,840
its

116
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
10-year anniversary in in various forms

117
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,160
and maybe it's time that we adopted as a

118
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,360
research group document and finish it

119
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
and the whole timing is based on the

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,599
idea that

121
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,120
if there is a good discussion we don't

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,840
want to

123
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,160
curtail that just because the the agenda

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
tells us so

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,599
so we have 20 minutes of flex time we

126
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,240
can sprinkle on on the various

127
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,000
items any comments on the agenda

128
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,319
okay so let's talk about the

129
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,520
research group for for a short time

130
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
uh in case new people are here

131
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,800
uh what is the point of the think to

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,160
think research group

133
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,400
well the point is that we have a large

134
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,360
number of

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
standardization activities in the ietf

136
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,560
uh that that are related to the internet

137
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,160
of things depending on how you

138
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,280
count them there's that's about 15 to 18

139
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,520
working groups right now and a few have

140
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
already been closed because they have

141
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
done that up

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
and what the research group actually is

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,440
trying to do

144
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,720
is look at the the whole

145
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,199
forest and not just the trees that the

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,199
working groups are looking at and see

147
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,759
what is needed to make an internet where

148
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,960
low resource nodes

149
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,000
things constraint nodes cyber physical

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
systems and so on

151
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,520
can communicate among themselves and

152
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,720
with the wider

153
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
internet and of course that's very big

154
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,240
area so we focus on issues where there

155
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,159
might be opportunities for

156
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,880
ietf standardization and really it

157
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,159
really starts

158
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,919
slightly above layer 2 and ends at

159
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,399
application layer security functions

160
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,640
possibly even user interface

161
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,480
i think we had a proposal at one point

162
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
to actually collect

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
icons that would be used in in a user

164
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,320
interface

165
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,080
for iot things i think that's something

166
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,839
we should pick up again at some point

167
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
um so visually if you look at

168
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,279
the way the irtf and the ietf interacts

169
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,760
the the irtf think the thing research

170
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,279
group is at the top

171
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,880
of course we also interact with other

172
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,560
research groups which is not shown on

173
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,040
this

174
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,399
picture but we we interact with other

175
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:20,880
groups

176
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
in the with working groups in the itf

177
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
and there are the actual engineering

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,160
working groups like core

179
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,600
um which has been doing copen related

180
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560
protocols and a more recent one is asdf

181
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,040
which is engineering a format for

182
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
uh supporting iot uh model

183
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
uh convergence in in the sense of

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,399
consolidation and transformation

185
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,200
um there are also some groups in the itf

186
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
that also

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
are more on the informational side so

188
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
for instance there is the eric

189
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
group which has recently

190
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,519
completed for instance some really

191
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
interesting work on on

192
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,839
getting the right ecc curves out there

193
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,160
for constrained devices they have looked

194
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,440
at tcp

195
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
for constraint uis and so on so that's

196
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,880
what eric does

197
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,760
and there is a very new thing called iot

198
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
ops which

199
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,959
is discussing operational issues which

200
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,000
often are security issues in the end

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,519
um so it's a very interesting group to

202
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,839
interact with

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,760
um the the meetings we are trying to

204
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,320
organize

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
are summary meetings like the current

206
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
one where we try to

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,440
to bring things together we also

208
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,880
have been having regular wishy calls

209
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,760
work on

210
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
uh inter ability

211
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,360
what is the expansion um

212
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
some something with interability hyper

213
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
media and and something

214
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,800
um where we meet

215
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
approximately monthly and discuss

216
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,399
various uh things

217
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
that has been uh paused for a while and

218
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,160
is now picking up

219
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
again and i expect that we will do this

220
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,600
monthly

221
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,880
again then we have

222
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
interaction with various

223
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,839
other sdos that use ietf

224
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,120
or that are related to ietf products

225
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,240
uh like oma and ocf and and w3c

226
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,279
um so what what ever we want to

227
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,000
do there is usually organized around a

228
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
specific topic that we want to

229
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,519
advance um we probably will have

230
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,639
another summary meeting at iatf 111

231
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,320
and one thing we haven't quite figured

232
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
out yet is how to do

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,079
online co-locating with academic

234
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,200
conferences

235
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
now online co-locating is is apparently

236
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,920
doesn't really make sense at the time

237
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
but

238
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
so how can we interact with academic

239
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
conferences

240
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,800
during the the time of the pandemic so

241
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,079
maybe we don't have to

242
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,120
to actually learn that because the times

243
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,880
of the pandemic will be over at some

244
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
point but

245
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,120
maybe it will drag on for a while

246
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
um there was a question in in the chat

247
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,360
that i missed

248
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
what about ap when and sheik at the crab

249
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,920
level

250
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
uh interesting questions um again there

251
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,639
are there are 15

252
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,279
working groups that really do um

253
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,399
stuff that is iot related and if people

254
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,760
want to bring up

255
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
things that have more researchy

256
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,120
perspective

257
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,760
to them please do just send a brief

258
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,600
message to the mailing list and

259
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
we can start the discussion

260
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,600
okay and finally we might have a

261
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,320
physical meeting at some point in time

262
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
again these usually have been quite

263
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,079
productive

264
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,000
and maybe madrid is the first time we

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,920
can do that again but let's see how that

266
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,160
works out so if if you have a calendar

267
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
maybe mark the week before moderate as

268
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,680
a time where we might be doing that

269
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,320
um there are several documents that are

270
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,279
research group

271
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
documents that we have adopted the

272
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,360
restful design

273
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
for iot document has recently got the

274
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
terminology update

275
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,199
and probably needs one more pass before

276
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,399
we can sign this

277
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
off we will talk about the the

278
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,720
edge computing and iot uh document today

279
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,440
and i think the the document is pretty

280
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,199
much cooked but we we need

281
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
a few reviews to actually decide this is

282
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,880
ready for publication

283
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
uh we have a secure bootstrapping for

284
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,480
iot document

285
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,720
uh that as i said has been around for a

286
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,519
while and we probably should be adopting

287
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,480
and also there are some non-internet

288
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
draft

289
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,199
documents called wishy notes which are

290
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,880
collecting at the

291
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
wishy wiki and that's also activity that

292
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
should be ramping up again now that

293
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,720
we are done with our asdf support

294
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,880
activity in wishy which kind of occupied

295
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,800
much of 2020 we also have a

296
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
very interesting new submission that

297
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,399
that we will talk about

298
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
uh today as well

299
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
so which yeah that's the expansion sorry

300
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,440
work on iot semantic hyper media

301
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
internal ability so this is where

302
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,880
we are semantics data models uh

303
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,800
hyperlinks and similar things uh go

304
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
um so as i said we we have been trying

305
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,120
to help the

306
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
the asdf working group get off the

307
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,880
ground that is

308
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,560
done dear now actually the the the asdf

309
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
working group has uh completed its first

310
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,440
deliverable

311
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,199
uh today um so we haven't published an

312
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,760
rfc yet because we still want to work on

313
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,839
the sdf

314
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,199
format but we have

315
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,040
after 1dm brought us a

316
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,880
working sdf 1.0 version we have managed

317
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,360
to

318
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,040
actually get a 1.1 1.1 version

319
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,839
agreed to today and that will be ongoing

320
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
but it will no longer be

321
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,519
an irtf activity

322
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,079
um we are looking at the various

323
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
standards in this space

324
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,920
in the semantics and hypermedia space

325
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,480
and

326
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
we are really interested in describing

327
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,759
them so

328
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,959
finding out how do these things fit

329
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,720
together where are they similar where

330
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,759
are they

331
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,920
doing very different things because it's

332
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,880
really hard when

333
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,040
when you learn about a new thing uh

334
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
actually penetrating the marketing

335
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,399
materials

336
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,360
and and finding out what it actually is

337
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
and we actually had an

338
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,399
uh online uh wishing meeting since the

339
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,519
last itf

340
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,959
and uh also uh an asushi

341
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,720
hackathon i will talk about

342
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
so what was that hackathon that that

343
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,560
happened last week and

344
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,720
it was joint uh work between asdf

345
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,000
and and uh wishy there were about seven

346
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,519
people actively contributing

347
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,920
so we had four things on on the agenda

348
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,360
uh one was focusing on on validating sdf

349
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
1.1 and essentially preparing

350
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
the decision that was made today to to

351
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
label the current version as sdf 1.1

352
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
and of course the tools and models that

353
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
are still sdf 1.0 need some attention to

354
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
move them to 1.1

355
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,480
michael costa produced a very

356
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,679
interesting modbus

357
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,880
example that tells us how to um

358
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,880
include uh ecosystems that are very much

359
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
focused on registers and and bits and

360
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,360
and so on

361
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,400
into this space we

362
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,520
actually defined uh some some uh

363
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
part of scf 1.1 that that was just

364
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,640
missing

365
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
the fragment identifier considerations

366
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,080
and we also identified a problem uh with

367
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,280
one component of sdf 1.0 that

368
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,640
we we we are going to work on in sdf one

369
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,919
point next

370
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,760
uh but that that is not currently part

371
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
of sdf 1.1

372
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,600
and we also had an interesting

373
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
discussion about the compact

374
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,320
notation for for sdf

375
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
the second activity was on on the

376
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,720
semantic proxy

377
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,559
work so we have various converters

378
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,679
and the hope is that we are able to use

379
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,360
these converters to connect

380
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
different ecosystems clients and servers

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
from different ecosystems

382
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,799
and have that connection guided by by

383
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,600
common

384
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,720
sdf obviously we need

385
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,559
some some additional functionality there

386
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,760
which is called mapping files here but

387
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,679
we already have some some interesting

388
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,240
demos

389
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
out there the third item was with new

390
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
tools for

391
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,160
sdf and one interesting tool is the sdf

392
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,160
thing maker that

393
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,520
simply assembles fds sdf things out of

394
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
sdf objects so we are now starting in

395
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,760
earnest to get tools that

396
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,120
operate on on sdf models

397
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
and build new models out of existing

398
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,039
models and that's certainly something

399
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,000
that that

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,880
is worth some some research

401
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
and finally we discussed mapping files

402
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,039
which are a way to add information

403
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,320
to an sdf model that might be ecosystem

404
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,640
specific so like ipso or

405
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,840
zigbee or bluetooth

406
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,600
or might even be uh instant specific

407
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,960
um and one aspect is

408
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,760
how to add protocol binding so you you

409
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,960
have some

410
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,600
abstract property in the sdf model at it

411
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,320
but

412
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,559
at some point you need to know what the

413
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,160
actual uri is and

414
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,200
john woman provided an interesting

415
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,600
proposal there

416
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,719
so that's my summary of the hackathon

417
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,880
i'm not watching the chat very

418
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,600
attentively

419
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,679
okay um

420
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,880
yeah with that uh more updates

421
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,200
and i hand over to mila

422
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,400
so it seems milan had some technical

423
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,159
challenges i'm not sure if he might

424
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,799
join yet

425
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
okay so maybe we just uh push

426
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
this uh to a later point i don't see him

427
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,880
in the

428
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,679
participants

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,720
yes let's let's take this on a later

430
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,000
stop when we have milan joining

431
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,559
thank you so um

432
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,919
i think that completes the the chairs

433
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
part of the overview and we can

434
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,720
now move over to uh michael mccool's

435
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
presentation

436
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,520
so if you see more than one screen

437
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,840
please select the presentation

438
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,919
here we go great

439
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,400
okay so i already typed in some stuff

440
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,679
into the notes

441
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,679
so for follow-up uh be aware there's

442
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,200
some urls and things like

443
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
already typed into the into the script

444
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
i'm just going to quickly go through you

445
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,760
know this and

446
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,400
see what we can do here so the web of

447
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:42,960
things

448
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
is a w3c activity uh which as you

449
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,400
probably know

450
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
focuses on web technologies most of the

451
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,159
browser

452
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,120
but the the wall activity is focused on

453
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,320
iot

454
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
and is focused on applying those web

455
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,400
technologies to iot

456
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
and we didn't want to create a

457
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,320
completely

458
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,919
separate vertical stack because one of

459
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,440
the big problems with iot is the

460
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,400
proliferation of different silos

461
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,799
so instead we try to identify a gap and

462
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,720
the gap we identified this was you know

463
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,919
three or four years ago

464
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
was the lack of documentation between

465
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,480
different standards and how to connect

466
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,200
different things

467
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,760
and uh you know it was very hard to use

468
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,880
a system it wasn't

469
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,840
well documented and we wanted to see the

470
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,679
gap we saw was actually a need for

471
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,440
formal documentation

472
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
of you know the capabilities and way to

473
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
access a system

474
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,120
and we also want to create kind of a

475
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,440
common abstraction layer

476
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
so the what's been already published

477
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,640
from other things

478
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,760
is a metadata format which basically

479
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,039
describes

480
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,240
the network interface for a thing

481
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,880
and kind of maps it to an abstraction

482
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,240
based on properties events

483
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,880
and actions which if you're aware of sdf

484
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,600
is a very

485
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,159
is very similar model and in fact it's

486
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,960
closely aligned with the sdf activity

487
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,679
separate but aligned and so the idea

488
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,159
here

489
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,960
is as i explained the diagram below is

490
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,880
rather than having to do an n squared

491
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
you know end to end

492
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
every app supporting every possible

493
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,280
protocol

494
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,679
instead every app could support a common

495
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,120
abstraction

496
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,880
um in terms of you know kind of a

497
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
generic interface

498
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
and that abstraction can be mapped to

499
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
various uh protocols

500
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,960
but you still uh we're not trying to

501
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,280
like

502
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,360
um create a new protocol that does

503
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,039
everything instead we're trying to

504
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,039
create a common description language

505
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,760
so that apps can easily you know use

506
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,360
protocols directly but through an

507
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
abstraction

508
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,720
so we do think that the common protocol

509
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,880
for everything you know is not

510
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
the ship that is sailed that's not

511
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
really feasible at this point

512
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,679
there's too many protocols out there

513
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,600
embedded in the world so instead we're

514
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,480
just aiming at

515
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,080
having the common extraction as the

516
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,400
narrow ways

517
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,159
now i just want to give a brief

518
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,600
example what he looks like so

519
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,640
we are again focusing on describing

520
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,880
existing systems in a thing description

521
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,960
so we're not trying to be prescriptive

522
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,559
we are trying to support

523
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,880
i mean there is some recommendations for

524
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,440
new devices that are ridden from scratch

525
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,360
but we also want to have ability support

526
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,640
brownfield devices

527
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,679
devices they're already deployed and you

528
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,640
know you just want to figure out how to

529
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,559
talk to them you want to document them

530
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,679
and so you might deploy a thing

531
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,520
description and the thing description

532
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
might be supplied out of band

533
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
so the device doesn't have to know about

534
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
it necessarily

535
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
but we're also looking at extensions for

536
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,559
like smart

537
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
smart object concepts or directory

538
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,600
concepts

539
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,159
where devices know about what and can

540
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,600
directly participate

541
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,480
in for example distributing metadata at

542
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,000
any rate the thing description

543
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,520
is this json ld file and

544
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,240
you know it includes you know properties

545
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
events and actions there's an

546
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
information model for it

547
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,559
and technically jason ld is one

548
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,320
possible serialization of the

549
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,720
information model for a td

550
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,480
but it does mean that it's easy to

551
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,799
ingest into things like an rdf database

552
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,480
and then be able to do things like

553
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,679
semantic searches on it

554
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
so which is kind of the next point here

555
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,640
and well let me just talk about where we

556
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,360
are with our

557
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,240
process so we we published a bunch of

558
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,760
standards well we punched the thing

559
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,080
description and the architecture

560
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,440
in january technically um

561
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
and well january last year and now we're

562
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,640
working

563
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,080
we're almost at the end of our second

564
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,240
charter where we're doing

565
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,120
uh several updates we're updating our

566
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
theme description and we're updating

567
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
uh the architecture document we're also

568
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,200
developing some new standards in

569
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,919
discovery

570
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,120
and profiles and discovery is really

571
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,600
about

572
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,039
okay how do i find metadata and it's not

573
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,720
just about land discovery

574
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
it can also include things like internet

575
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,640
search or i give you a url to tell you

576
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,360
how to get

577
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
a td or whatever so it's a more general

578
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,960
concept of

579
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,559
finding metadata and it also

580
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,400
has a strong emphasis on privacy

581
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,919
preservation which is one of our major

582
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,840
constraints

583
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
and profiles is more about constraining

584
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,880
the implementations a bit

585
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,679
so that things work out of the box

586
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,880
there's also some

587
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,640
updated documents binding templates

588
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
is very similar the problem of mapping

589
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,640
that microcosm is bringing up

590
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,679
is how do you connect an abstract td to

591
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,960
a particular protocol

592
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
http or mbtq

593
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and the scripting api is a javascript

594
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,919
api that has an open source

595
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
implementation in node what

596
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,400
it's easier to use the abstraction the

597
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
most important link on this page is the

598
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,559
last one we just launched a new website

599
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,880
and so all this stuff will be available

600
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,400
from that website which hopefully is

601
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,679
fairly easy to find

602
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,760
if you just type in w3c and y you'll

603
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,158
find it

604
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,930
now so i think that

605
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,760
[Music]

606
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,000
that's basically you know the summary

607
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,120
and i think that

608
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,799
um uh to get mentioned a bit more

609
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,320
about you know discovery um discovery

610
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,840
is one of our major new thing i guess

611
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
i've spent the timeline

612
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,240
so we're currently finalizing our draft

613
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,320
with the intention of having

614
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,039
solid first drafts end of march and then

615
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,240
we want to have

616
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,360
complete drafts ready for review by may

617
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,399
1st

618
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,360
and we're looking at entering the formal

619
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
process and keep training into a

620
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,840
standard

621
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,919
within w3c at the beginning of july

622
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,480
so between may 1st and july we'll be

623
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,840
open for review

624
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,399
and we can still make changes at that

625
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,279
point

626
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,520
but then after the july first deadline

627
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
it's really hard to make changes

628
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,720
uh so uh so that's kind of the window

629
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,559
that we want to target if people want to

630
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,720
look at our standards and contribute

631
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,159
we do want to kind of wrap things up in

632
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,480
the next few months and and stabilize

633
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,240
these

634
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,919
um i should also mention for thing

635
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,640
description we're starting a thing model

636
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
and the thing mod so thing description

637
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,000
is about instance of a device

638
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,559
a thing model removes instance

639
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,279
particular

640
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,320
definitions like particular urls or

641
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,600
network addresses

642
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,919
so they're close thing models are closer

643
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:24,799
in concept

644
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,200
to sdf files and there's been some

645
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,520
exploration about converting stf files

646
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,120
into thing models

647
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,640
and to go to a thing description you

648
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,520
also need things like network address

649
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,440
okay so that's the update i will stop

650
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,200
here and if anybody has any short

651
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,679
questions

652
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,279
then we can check the time and see if

653
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,840
there's anything left

654
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,840
okay i'm not hearing any questions

655
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,559
but okay well i guess maybe we can move

656
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,240
on but if anyone wants to follow up

657
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,880
uh we do have a face-to-face next week

658
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,480
actually the next two weeks

659
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,720
and if you would like to attend some of

660
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,240
the open sessions

661
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,279
um uh send me an email and we can uh we

662
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,799
can get we can bring you bring you in as

663
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,080
a guest

664
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,559
um otherwise the web page and the specs

665
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,919
are out there at these urls

666
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,080
yeah thank you michael there are some

667
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,440
pretty good uh

668
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,120
links in the cody md in the notes

669
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,679
document so if you want to know more

670
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,360
about

671
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,840
these activities i want to find out

672
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,279
what's happening

673
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,399
in the next few weeks uh please look at

674
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:42,799
the

675
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,840
the notes and there are links you can

676
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,760
click on unfortunately you cannot link

677
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
on the quick

678
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,120
click on the links here in in the slides

679
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,240
that we are

680
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
looking at that's the limitation of mute

681
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,440
echo

682
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,039
uh right right but again they're in the

683
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
pdf they're clickable in the pdf and

684
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,799
they're also clickable on the notes page

685
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,000
right so any

686
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,120
no more questions for michael

687
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,080
in which case we can switch back to

688
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,279
milan who has

689
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,559
made it onto a

690
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,399
mid echo so i'm taking away

691
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,158
your screen michael thank you

692
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,720
it always takes a slight dance

693
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,840
to do this

694
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,279
okay milan go ahead yeah

695
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,760
good morning uh i'm milan de la cruz

696
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,679
from um

697
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,039
calling from california this morning and

698
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,080
this is a brief update uh

699
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,120
about three minutes on uh the paper and

700
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,720
activity that we are starting

701
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,679
in describing the iot standards i'm

702
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
gonna get the next slide please

703
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,679
oh am i can i move the slides or okay

704
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,039
great

705
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,440
and so basically we have had the

706
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,720
discussion for a while in uh

707
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,600
to tr research group and then basically

708
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,519
in wishy meetings

709
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,159
to create a paper probably in the form

710
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,880
of informational rfc

711
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,120
that will describe key attributes of iot

712
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,279
standards nothing new there

713
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,360
and information models but in a

714
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,640
consistent manner

715
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,120
basically agree on the structure and the

716
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,440
concept and how they are described

717
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,519
and then allow standards to be

718
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,640
described in a consistent manner this

719
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,200
is important and potentially useful

720
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
because um

721
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
different standards groups have

722
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,720
different assumptions

723
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
some of which are articulated some of

724
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,919
which are not

725
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,480
they have some implicit point of views

726
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,760
that are not clear so it's very

727
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,640
difficult

728
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,440
for somebody from outside to understand

729
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,559
the landscape

730
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,559
by reading the charters or by reading

731
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,159
introductions and architectural

732
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:07,039
documents

733
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,000
and be able to compare as to what they

734
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,840
do and what the objective is

735
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,399
and how well they may suit the needs of

736
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,159
somebody who's trying to either adopt

737
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,200
them or work with them

738
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,399
or or just understand them so what we

739
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,279
are looking for

740
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,720
is is trying to do a sort of high level

741
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,559
description but provide some structure

742
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,760
and

743
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,960
almost like the checklist of what is the

744
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,600
intent

745
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,399
what is the purpose the scope and the

746
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,440
approach

747
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,480
using some common terms and criteria and

748
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,320
and and then doing so define the terms

749
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,519
articulate the concept assumptions not

750
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,600
the implicit assumptions or everybody in

751
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,279
the group knows it sort of

752
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,080
becomes a group knowledge by osmosis but

753
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,799
it's not always obvious in documents

754
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,640
the intent is definitely not to

755
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,960
redescribe the standards to rehash their

756
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,399
specification

757
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,399
the intent is to foster the

758
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,559
understanding so probably

759
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,000
a relatively good analogy to think about

760
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,200
this effort is like making an

761
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,320
iot information standards labeling guide

762
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,640
like you have the food labels in terms

763
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,919
of nutritional contact and calories and

764
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,000
various others think agreeing on what is

765
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,440
the structure of the things to be

766
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,399
described

767
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,240
and how they are quantified obviously

768
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,320
wouldn't be quantifying them here

769
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,120
but uh we would provide a common basis

770
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
for comparison

771
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,200
a straightforward which is uh you know

772
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,880
we like to do it

773
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,080
we'll try and see if we succeed is to

774
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,720
get

775
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,039
some of the important ongoing standards

776
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,559
described in this manner or

777
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,679
at least and concept described obviously

778
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,159
not the specifications

779
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,480
and we would rely initially we were

780
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,159
going to do that as part of the paper

781
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,240
but it turned out to be rather onerous

782
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,720
and

783
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,320
probably prolonged practical length

784
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,960
we will seek contributions from seo

785
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,039
participants to do that

786
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,040
in my final slide please question

787
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,800
so the current status is we have

788
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
discussed in an earlier meeting in june

789
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,239
in t2 trg

790
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,440
uh strowman of what the common

791
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,760
description criteria need to cover what

792
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,280
are sort of the items we think will

793
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
cover that's available as a document

794
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,239
at this link and the suggestions are

795
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,480
welcome it can give you an idea of what

796
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,119
the outline of things in this effort

797
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,960
uh the outline the first sort of draft

798
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,199
that puts everything down not

799
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,079
necessarily

800
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,199
obviously the final form is planned in

801
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,280
about six to eight weeks and i'll take

802
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,159
the lead on

803
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,159
on doing that and of course welcoming

804
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,879
contribution and co-authors it will be

805
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:57,520
made

806
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,040
available for review and comments

807
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
initially in

808
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,920
trg working group so that you know

809
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,760
we bring it to a more mature level

810
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,240
before sharing it with others

811
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
as i mentioned contributors are sort

812
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,400
either now although this is a very fuzzy

813
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,359
description

814
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,880
but you can email me and and you know

815
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,359
we can interact or after the first draft

816
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,440
which i said is going to be done in

817
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,880
about

818
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,560
weeks both contributors in terms of

819
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
ideas and concepts as well as co-authors

820
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,440
are solicited

821
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,680
if you have also done there are several

822
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,960
floating

823
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,560
comparisons of applicable standards that

824
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,400
contact the authors often see if they

825
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,240
want to participate and obviously they

826
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,040
will be incorporated as references into

827
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,320
this work

828
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,200
and in terms of actually describing

829
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,880
standards along this line i

830
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
know we have discussed earlier both

831
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,359
michael koster and michael mccool

832
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,440
have done some more detailed feature

833
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,200
analysis of various standards and

834
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,480
comparison

835
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,839
and we i'll work with them also and

836
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,160
we'll work together to incorporate those

837
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,760
as well

838
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,599
this is basically a very brief update

839
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,200
that i wanted to give you on this

840
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,320
activity and

841
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,880
obviously when we have the first draft

842
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,119
it's going to be more tangible

843
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,160
and um something

844
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,960
to discuss that's basically my update

845
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,000
and uh

846
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,839
i give it back to captain

847
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,680
okay thank you milan so i'm going to

848
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,079
click

849
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,160
this link because i can

850
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,799
i cannot

851
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,000
oops normally

852
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,119
ah there it is yeah it is

853
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,839
yeah so you find more information in in

854
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,880
the

855
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,520
github repository that the thing to

856
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,960
think research

857
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,160
um group uses and in particular

858
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,920
in the wishy part of that i just wanted

859
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,000
to point that out

860
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,599
for people who want to see what what has

861
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,040
been done there here already

862
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:23,839
okay thank you milan any questions

863
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,760
thank you so in this case we are

864
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,960
on time the next

865
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,079
um item is michael's presentation do you

866
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,280
want to present michael

867
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,880
share i put the request hmm yep

868
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,200
all right you get that

869
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,119
and we can just run the slide from here

870
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,960
do you see it

871
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,040
it's working on it yeah

872
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,400
still working on it

873
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
i'm not getting a dialogue but let me

874
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,640
let me go out of full screen and see if

875
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,400
i got a dialogue somewhere asking me to

876
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,240
approve something yeah let's see

877
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,280
yep i had to click a green button

878
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,520
oh and i have to open my system

879
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,200
preferences well let's see if it'll let

880
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,560
me just click on something

881
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,760
otherwise i may need to yeah

882
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,400
maybe i should do the sharing so yeah

883
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,000
maybe you need to do it because it looks

884
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,839
like i have some dialogue to go through

885
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,200
yeah it's

886
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,640
always dangerous to update

887
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,720
your system michael actually updated his

888
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,079
system

889
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,240
the the night before the meeting and

890
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,320
i learned why it was that i don't often

891
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,480
update my system but the longer you wait

892
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,400
the more painful it is and

893
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,480
basically every application now acts

894
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,640
like it's brand new and

895
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,440
anyway great um so this is a summary of

896
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
what we've been doing with one data

897
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,520
model

898
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,079
mostly and some other related things

899
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:06,720
also

900
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,839
next slide please

901
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
our goal in one data model was

902
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,599
originally or is is

903
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,440
still mainly to normalize the

904
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
information models for iot

905
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,200
uh pretty much across industry

906
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,839
information models and data models

907
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,599
but it really is an information model

908
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,359
focus we call it one data model

909
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,839
uh i think maybe some historically that

910
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,440
most people recognize that

911
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,640
and uh saying information model

912
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,839
is more correct but you know

913
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,800
and it brings up some questions so it

914
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,760
seems like

915
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,440
you know we're all right that's it this

916
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,680
way what we ended up really

917
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,839
uh deciding to do was really kind of

918
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,599
refine that mission a little bit and

919
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,520
what we're providing for really broad

920
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,599
semantic interoperability across

921
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,000
industry we want to converge the

922
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,320
existing models and we want to

923
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,880
create a system of interoperability and

924
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,640
reusability at the semantic level

925
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,280
among other things so it started as a

926
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,800
liaison group between

927
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,520
sdos and you know we have zigbee and oma

928
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,359
and ocf and bluetooth mesh and

929
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,280
and some other more vertical oriented

930
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,560
ones

931
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,240
and um we decided to focus on

932
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,560
a representation language a modeling

933
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,880
language or a domain specific language

934
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,079
for this work

935
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,640
and that the outcome of that was sdf so

936
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,880
i'd say that the sdf prototype

937
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,760
which we call 1.0 is really our phase

938
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,280
one work product from

939
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,760
one data model and that that sort of got

940
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,040
transferred over to

941
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,160
ietf the middle of last year and then

942
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,000
we were toward the end of last year

943
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
next slide please the current status is

944
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,520
we have about 200

945
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,839
examples of object models which are the

946
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,640
main sort of reusable building block it

947
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
it's a slice of functionality like

948
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,920
turning something on or off and

949
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,319
or changing the color and so a typical

950
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,760
product will have a

951
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,400
a set of these object models to describe

952
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,800
its full functionality but we have 200

953
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,119
of these

954
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,920
mainly the whole catalog of ocf and and

955
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,240
episode smart objects

956
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,839
minus a few that are kind of corner

957
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,480
cases and then

958
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,040
um a few examples from zigbee and

959
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,640
bluetooth but we haven't done

960
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,680
any wholesale conversions from from from

961
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,160
those

962
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,240
uh catalogs yet but that's in the future

963
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
we have automated tools that have been

964
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,520
built by

965
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,000
uh folks on the call here mostly uh

966
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,319
converting from ocf and oma

967
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,640
uh back and forth around tripable to and

968
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,319
from sdf

969
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,200
um and that's where all those 200 models

970
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,960
came from is there's some automated

971
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,119
conversion

972
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,520
new models also can be easily generated

973
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,440
in sdf and then converted

974
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,079
you know down converted if you are

975
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,920
targeted toward

976
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,800
oma ocf or others once we have the

977
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,920
converters

978
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,800
and the whole system then models can be

979
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,760
translated from one ecosystem to another

980
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
through the standard sdf models i can

981
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,839
take an ocf model and up convert it to

982
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,240
sdf down

983
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,759
converted to oma

984
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,359
for example and that allows me to can

985
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,319
translate from one model to another

986
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:29,359
next slide please so

987
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,079
the one one uh was mentioned the

988
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,960
semantic proxy this is one useful

989
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,520
uh one use of this ability to translate

990
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,800
those models and

991
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,119
this is sort of picture gets refined a

992
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,800
little every time this is sort of the

993
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,319
best one so far

994
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,880
if we were to use uh we already have

995
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,960
some proxy functionality with web of

996
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,440
things

997
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,079
in in a project called the eclipse

998
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:52,800
project called

999
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,480
node watt and uh it consumes

1000
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,440
it or it uses thing description to

1001
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,400
consume and expose apis and so the idea

1002
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,520
here

1003
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,400
is to take a common sdf file for

1004
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,920
something like a

1005
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,319
lightweight or an oma or ipso smart

1006
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,359
object

1007
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,880
sensor and convert it to sdf

1008
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,079
and then convert that sdf to ocf

1009
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,280
and that provides a swagger or an open

1010
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,920
api

1011
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,599
2.0 description that an ocf client can

1012
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,000
then go

1013
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,119
use to consume an api and what we're

1014
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,440
working on is automatically consuming

1015
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,560
the oma

1016
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,839
device and exposing it as an ocf

1017
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,880
device for the ocf client and building a

1018
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,680
sort of an automated bridge between an

1019
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,800
oma

1020
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,160
an mso device server and an ocf client

1021
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,480
and we have a few ad hoc patches that

1022
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,200
have been

1023
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,160
created to sort of you know continuity

1024
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,000
test various parts of this but this is

1025
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,359
what we're working

1026
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:59,200
uh for is our sort of first big demo

1027
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,079
for one dm and why you want your models

1028
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,760
on one dm and one of the one of the

1029
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,800
useful things that

1030
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,280
can happen other than just you know

1031
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,440
everyone converging and arriving at a

1032
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,119
common set of models

1033
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,119
if you want to translate models this is

1034
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,000
a great intermediate step

1035
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,359
alright next slide please

1036
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,359
we need to kind of finish up here to

1037
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,440
stay on time

1038
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,319
so going forward um since we have the

1039
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,359
now a

1040
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,200
stable implementation draft of the

1041
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,040
language we're going to go out

1042
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,960
reach out to zigbee and the bluetooth

1043
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
mesh folks and some of the others

1044
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,880
and and start getting contributions in

1045
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,240
and start working on

1046
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,520
the conversions and eventually get

1047
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,480
going on our convergence process so we

1048
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,119
have

1049
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,280
uh also a few broader use cases and

1050
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,040
collaborations we're involved with as

1051
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,480
some of this has been mentioned before

1052
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,319
but there's a solar energy spec

1053
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,960
sunspec that currently have a modbus

1054
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,119
register definition but

1055
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,359
we could add all the semantics to that

1056
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,720
and and they were interested

1057
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,920
about a year ago so we want to get that

1058
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,160
and

1059
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,200
so there's uh some folks doing textile

1060
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,279
manufacturing equipment contacted us

1061
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,880
there's some work being done on

1062
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,720
electronic data sheets

1063
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,839
that is closely related that's

1064
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,480
uh they would like to look at using sdf

1065
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,960
um

1066
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,480
again there's an iso sc41 um

1067
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,079
sort of um it's a little

1068
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,440
tighter i guess you'd say they sort of

1069
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,319
would want to see sdf be sort of part of

1070
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,200
part of that

1071
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,520
and uh not clear exactly how the

1072
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,040
integration is and maybe others could

1073
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,319
explain it a little more

1074
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,560
and also we were contacted by the u.s

1075
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,240
standards bureau called the national

1076
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,079
institute for standards and technology

1077
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,400
or nist in the u.s

1078
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,280
to uh to look at common ways of modeling

1079
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,800
things and they were quite interested

1080
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,240
also

1081
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,560
a lot of this is basically just sdf and

1082
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,720
not really one data model so uh

1083
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,040
we probably need to look at where the

1084
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,640
center of the collaboration

1085
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,240
really needs to be for some of these

1086
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,240
things so textile

1087
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,920
might and electronic data sheets might

1088
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,800
be more 1dm but sc41 and this might be

1089
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,800
more

1090
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,800
you know sdf and basically we want to

1091
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,960
get the convergence process going and

1092
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,079
start working on parallel tracks where

1093
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,880
we can separate the dependencies between

1094
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,800
groups of models as some group of people

1095
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,160
want to be interested in

1096
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,480
pushing one set of models forward

1097
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,440
another group

1098
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,920
you know vertically vertical uh groups

1099
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,520
maybe somebody working on lighting

1100
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,280
someone else working on

1101
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,040
appliances someone else working on

1102
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,599
energy and we want to get a two-week

1103
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,960
cycle going between

1104
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,200
uh work and questions coming up and then

1105
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,599
broader review and

1106
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,240
the broader process so uh on to the next

1107
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,839
slide please

1108
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,079
yeah so the super i'm not going to talk

1109
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,920
through all of this but basically

1110
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,400
this shows that we we have existing

1111
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,920
models we have new models that are going

1112
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,599
to be created and then we have models

1113
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,720
that are going to be sort of

1114
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
alloys or amalgams of existing models

1115
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,760
and

1116
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,520
and those all kind of start off

1117
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,359
differently but end up consolidating

1118
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,800
down to the same

1119
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,200
adoption process next slide please

1120
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,280
and which which i'm not going to talk

1121
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,640
through this either but essentially

1122
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,160
models go into a thing we call the

1123
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,200
playground

1124
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,520
where this uh this alloying and this

1125
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,599
annealing and working off the rough

1126
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,079
edges and convergence takes place

1127
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,000
then they go through a review cycle

1128
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,079
which they can get but kick back from

1129
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,079
our work or they can go on forward

1130
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,359
to a sort of a last call

1131
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,599
and a model adoption process where they

1132
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,359
get published in our

1133
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,400
official adoption repo and uh

1134
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
we're basically just on the leading edge

1135
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,559
of that we have stuff in the playground

1136
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,520
and we're

1137
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,640
we're just about to as soon as all the

1138
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,040
all the plug fest and hackathons and

1139
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,920
meetings are over

1140
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,160
we'll select a set of modding models out

1141
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,599
of the playground

1142
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,760
and work toward convergence and i think

1143
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,200
we have a couple of different

1144
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,280
verticals already selected to work on

1145
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,800
there

1146
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,839
next slide please so

1147
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,599
right the the playground is where the

1148
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,599
models are converged

1149
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,640
there will be separate repositories for

1150
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,960
um contributors i don't know exactly how

1151
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,200
it works but since it's on github

1152
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,680
all we really need to do is share the ci

1153
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,960
and and we can

1154
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,640
scale to what we want they don't all

1155
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,119
have to be in our organization but um

1156
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,880
right now we're thinking they will be in

1157
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,440
the same 1dm org

1158
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,920
just for the sake of collaboration but

1159
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,880
the

1160
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,640
contributors will be able to sort of

1161
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,480
manage their own name space while

1162
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,119
they're

1163
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,200
preparing for contribution and then

1164
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,640
there's also some repo

1165
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,119
exploratory repositories for testing new

1166
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,240
features with one repo now

1167
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,240
to look at the mappings and extensions

1168
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,599
and things like that that we're doing

1169
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,960
and play those out without

1170
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,599
uh without introducing too many ci

1171
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,920
issues into the playground

1172
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,000
so um i think i have one more slide

1173
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,599
ah no references so um basically

1174
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,839
go look we have some stuff you can poke

1175
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,079
out at 1dm and of course sdf that folks

1176
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,040
already hear all

1177
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,839
know about already thank you

1178
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,599
thank you michael so 1dm is in the kind

1179
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,240
of similar situation that they

1180
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,960
focused on getting sdf going for a while

1181
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:35,760
and now can

1182
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,720
go back to their to their own business

1183
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,079
and

1184
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,280
actually get models accepted and

1185
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,200
converged and so on so any questions to

1186
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:59,520
michael on this

1187
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,920
so michael what's the time frame for you

1188
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,280
think it's going to happen for getting

1189
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,480
this all standardized

1190
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,960
and you have any idea

1191
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,440
for what i didn't quite hear your last

1192
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,800
bit

1193
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,480
uh do you have any idea what your time

1194
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,319
frames are for like uh

1195
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,880
getting this these drafts stabilized and

1196
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,400
finalized

1197
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,000
i was in the meeting earlier this today

1198
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and i know there's some

1199
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,240
new some final pr's are being discussed

1200
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,760
but now you are talking about asdf oh

1201
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,359
yeah

1202
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,480
yeah we finished that and sdf 1.1 has

1203
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,079
been posted

1204
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,920
so we are now officially in the one

1205
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,119
point next phase in

1206
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,160
in asdf okay so i basically drafted five

1207
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,800
right right so now you're in like

1208
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,400
looking for new features to

1209
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,359
to uh consider i guess round yeah i'm

1210
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,280
not really looking for new features we

1211
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:53,599
know

1212
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,319
a lot of new features that we should be

1213
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,200
considering so

1214
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,680
that was actually more than half of the

1215
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,800
meeting uh

1216
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,280
this morning where we um looked at what

1217
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,359
we already know what needs to be part of

1218
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,720
one dot next

1219
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,160
right well i guess what i mean is you're

1220
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,920
now in the phase of

1221
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,160
new development as opposed to trying to

1222
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,280
nitpick

1223
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:23,839
the release okay

1224
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,079
okay

1225
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,240
one question from the jabber was

1226
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,240
are there any links from one dm to

1227
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,839
organizations like

1228
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,119
ipbliss and chip

1229
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,599
zigbee organization that runs project

1230
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,119
chip is a member and

1231
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,040
a number of the members from project

1232
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,200
chip were founding members

1233
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,720
of uh one dm basically they

1234
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,400
they were strong enough desire to

1235
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,800
converge across industry that they

1236
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,880
they worked on one dm for a while and

1237
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,559
then uh sort of

1238
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,200
um i i would say it was part of them

1239
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,880
being able to find each other to go to

1240
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,800
zigbee org and decide to

1241
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,319
to go straight to implementation of uh

1242
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,400
of the chip standard as a way to uh

1243
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,720
fulfill their commercial interests

1244
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,319
but one dm is the more long-term uh

1245
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,240
focus of converging the models and

1246
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,720
there's still a desire from zigbee

1247
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,559
to do that although they're now very

1248
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:27,760
busy with chip and

1249
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,359
they need to get chip out the door

1250
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,440
before they're going to have significant

1251
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,599
but the good news is the models from

1252
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,520
chip to zigbee aren't really that much

1253
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,040
different there'll be some new ones of

1254
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,559
course since there are new

1255
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,839
new players um ip bliss we

1256
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,240
and other other organizations like that

1257
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,800
i think we have had some contact

1258
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,960
uh i'm to the extent that the mission

1259
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,400
that our mission and theirs

1260
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,440
align um there was there was some

1261
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,119
interest but i'm not sure what going

1262
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:57,119
forward uh is going to be and i'm not

1263
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,319
sure if wowder

1264
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,319
is on the on the call he might be able

1265
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,280
to say more but i don't see wilder

1266
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,480
water vendor vanderbik is our contact

1267
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:14,960
with iplus

1268
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,040
thank you michael that was interesting

1269
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,880
so uh

1270
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:29,119
questions more questions for michael

1271
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,720
okay andrea says thanks

1272
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,839
okay with that uh thank you michael

1273
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,000
and we are moving to

1274
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,400
the next presentation again michael

1275
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,920
richardson ah you heard

1276
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,040
already have the screen ready

1277
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,559
and i have to press a few buttons

1278
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,839
to make that happen

1279
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,480
yeah great good hi

1280
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,760
um so i'm just here to talk about um

1281
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,079
this document which has been suggested

1282
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:10,800
to become

1283
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,359
a taxonomy of i should put the document

1284
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,880
title in there i'm sorry

1285
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,160
of uh i idev id issues

1286
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,839
um so this was first presented last

1287
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,839
summer at sec dispatch

1288
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,280
um with a kind of like i don't know

1289
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,520
where to send this what to do with it

1290
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,240
um and um carson suggested that tdt

1291
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,640
rg would be a good place to do this and

1292
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,720
so now i'm talking to you

1293
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,680
um so this is about roots of trust and

1294
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,079
trust

1295
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,720
anchors and these terms are sounds

1296
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,599
really confusing

1297
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,760
to some people even in the security

1298
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,599
space um because

1299
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,000
um they are actually in some sense they

1300
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,119
are our anc

1301
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:52,480
are are opposites of each other so a

1302
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,599
root of trust is

1303
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,400
in the in the trusted computing space is

1304
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,200
actually

1305
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,319
um usually something that you sign um

1306
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,720
your data with so it's in fact some kind

1307
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,400
of a private key that's embedded in a

1308
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,160
device that's used in some cases for

1309
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,839
attestation

1310
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,119
and that's why it's called the root

1311
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,960
where you start with whereas trust

1312
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,720
anchors are public keys that you embed

1313
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,640
into the device that allow you to verify

1314
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,960
things that other things people say

1315
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,599
and as i said if you go into the pki

1316
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,000
community

1317
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,280
and start talking about roots of trust

1318
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,040
they assume you mean trust anchors and

1319
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,680
that's often not the case though but

1320
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,040
what we're really talking about is that

1321
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,440
in

1322
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,280
both cases what's what's important at

1323
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,440
the very bottom of the process

1324
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,799
and there's this allusions to its

1325
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,319
turtles all the way down and the answer

1326
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:35,760
is well no it can't be somewhere's at

1327
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,559
the bottom is a

1328
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,040
is a turtle that anchors it all and that

1329
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
fundamentally is a private key whether

1330
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,240
it's in the device or

1331
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,400
if it's in a manufacturing plant or

1332
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,599
infrastructure

1333
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,920
and one of the things that i've noticed

1334
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,599
is that when peop we have conversations

1335
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,359
about security considerations around

1336
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,880
other documents

1337
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,960
one of the questions is well what's the

1338
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,559
incentive to keep some of this private

1339
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,680
key private and

1340
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,520
who's going to attack what and how can i

1341
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,960
really trust it and what about this

1342
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,359
manufacturer who didn't do things right

1343
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,359
and and that's kind of a slippery slope

1344
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,359
of just kind of disastrous things in a

1345
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,040
document because it's essentially asking

1346
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,480
layer 9 or

1347
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,920
financial and type questions about

1348
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,319
a technical document and we don't really

1349
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,000
have a good way of answering it so this

1350
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,680
is an attempt to kind of um

1351
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,799
qualitatively answer it on there so this

1352
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,400
is what the document's about

1353
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,839
um it's about the quality of these

1354
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,599
turtles how secure are they who

1355
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,599
who owns them who controls them how are

1356
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,720
they created

1357
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,839
and how are they provisioning and one of

1358
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:34,720
the things that

1359
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,240
you kind of have to realize when i come

1360
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,160
back to this at the end is that

1361
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,760
if you can change the software then of

1362
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,000
course you can change uh what keys it

1363
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
thinks does what and so in some sense

1364
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,520
the ultimate uh

1365
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,839
trust anchor is the one that defines

1366
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,200
what software you're able to run

1367
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,920
so one of the first first questions is

1368
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,520
about the roots of trust so this

1369
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,559
fundamentally is an idev id um if you

1370
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,280
want it's not always but it usually is

1371
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,720
and the question is how do you get it

1372
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,799
into the device so this means a key pair

1373
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,480
private key pair that needs to be kept

1374
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,079
in the device um

1375
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,000
and how was it produced um how was this

1376
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,359
associated probably certificate um

1377
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,720
uh uh created um what

1378
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,720
resistance do we have against devices

1379
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,760
which are

1380
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,440
um being signed with the uh keys that

1381
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,440
um that is inappropriate devices are

1382
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,040
being signed and what's the opposite

1383
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,680
where

1384
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,880
uh devices that you don't know um

1385
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,559
have been compromised and they're

1386
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,880
they're still said to be good

1387
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,480
um and one of the big problems with this

1388
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,760
is that when you go through the supply

1389
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,640
chain

1390
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,960
processes there's usually two some three

1391
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,799
layers of ndas involved

1392
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,240
and just mentioned before i continue

1393
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,599
that some of these roots of trust some

1394
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,280
of these things are in some cases

1395
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,359
symmetric keys

1396
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,599
but usually there's another layer of in

1397
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,760
the supply chain that turns that into a

1398
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,640
asymmetric key but you won't find that

1399
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,040
out

1400
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,799
unless you signed all the ndas and know

1401
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,400
what's going on

1402
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,720
um so the goal of this document is to

1403
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,640
ideally to have some kind of a thing

1404
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,000
that says

1405
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,559
well you've done the following thing and

1406
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,000
i don't really care if you got a

1407
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,119
certificate from

1408
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,720
some government body that said you did

1409
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,240
the right thing or

1410
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,319
you have the cheetos level of security

1411
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,680
here um

1412
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,359
because what i care is that you're able

1413
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,040
to distinguish those two and that you

1414
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,760
have can say

1415
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,359
i point to the top one or you point to

1416
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,880
the bottom one and

1417
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,559
for some devices you know what that

1418
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,160
cheetos might be actually all the

1419
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,839
security you actually needed on your

1420
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:34,799
bike shed that may be enough

1421
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,680
so the document has a uh outline and it

1422
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,280
deals with different types of identities

1423
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,440
and it deals with a series of evaluation

1424
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,960
questions that i'm suggesting

1425
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,079
that i would like to be answerable uh by

1426
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,680
things i'm not proposing to answer them

1427
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,280
for any specific case and i'm actually

1428
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,720
not proposing to even

1429
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,119
to say what are good values and what are

1430
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,400
bad values but

1431
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,319
here is a value and we agree what the

1432
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,720
definition of that value is

1433
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,240
there so sec dispatch said go out and

1434
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,319
ask industry people outside the ietf

1435
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,599
what's going on

1436
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,440
and i've presented it four or five other

1437
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,359
conferences uh or groups

1438
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,559
in this and uh um about

1439
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,640
four other one-on-one conferences with

1440
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,160
various suppliers

1441
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,160
um and i'm bugging them regularly to

1442
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
give me some kind of replies everyone's

1443
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,760
really interested but it's not a high

1444
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,040
priority

1445
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,480
um so um unfortunately i don't have a

1446
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,079
lot of feedback for that but it is the

1447
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,440
goal to get that through

1448
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,920
through some kind of a process this way

1449
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,160
and i would certainly like your help

1450
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,480
in that

1451
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,920
so um some of the things that are

1452
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,359
described in this document

1453
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:46,720
is the structure of a pki um

1454
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,280
one of the questions is for instance is

1455
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,920
this

1456
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,680
level zero or level one

1457
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,640
and uh the conclusion is that if you

1458
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,480
just had this pki and you just had a

1459
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,839
self-signed certificate that you

1460
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:01,920
actually have a pki of level with

1461
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,119
a depth of one not of depth zero um the

1462
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,960
second question is the second level of

1463
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,160
pkis is that an intermediate pca or is

1464
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,000
it a subordinate ca

1465
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,319
and after some discussion and reviewing

1466
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,359
other things it

1467
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:17,440
seems that subordinate is the preferred

1468
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,440
term even though a lot of documents

1469
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,280
will often treat them in uh

1470
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,359
interchangeably those terms

1471
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,480
um if you want to see what uh an

1472
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,040
intermediate ca looks like then follow

1473
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,079
this link

1474
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,400
and um you have to go and play with some

1475
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,720
of the zoom in and out and and clicking

1476
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,160
on some of the things and you will see

1477
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:36,559
the

1478
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,480
immense complexity which has been

1479
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,680
created in the u.s

1480
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,119
federal uh bridge ca system

1481
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,440
through a number of intermediate cas and

1482
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,880
those are quite clearly

1483
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,319
documented in quite a number of

1484
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,319
documents as intermediate cas

1485
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:51,920
and so i'm going to avoid that term and

1486
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,599
i suggest you to do and anyway

1487
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,359
subordinate just sounds so cool i think

1488
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:56,079
is a

1489
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,280
term um and so it deals with also

1490
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,720
recovery and resilience and

1491
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,720
and how are the private keys generated

1492
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,400
and how are they kept safe is an

1493
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,319
important discussion that i think you

1494
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:07,440
need to that need to

1495
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,280
that's usually what we want to be able

1496
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,160
to talk about in the end

1497
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,440
um so i've proposed a number of terms

1498
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,640
um this isn't i don't know if it's an

1499
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,240
ontology or not but

1500
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,799
it's a series of questions that uh i

1501
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,559
would like to know i would like someone

1502
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,720
to be able to describe

1503
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,520
in a way and the goal again is not to

1504
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,680
say that a two-level pki is better than

1505
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,280
a three-level pki

1506
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,559
or worse or there but to agree that if

1507
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,480
someone says they have a two-level pki

1508
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,920
then you know what it is and if they say

1509
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,000
they have a three-level pki in which

1510
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,640
one of them has a secret sharing policy

1511
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,200
of

1512
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
you know four out of seven then you can

1513
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,640
actually know what that means and you

1514
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,839
can actually say okay

1515
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,839
that makes sense and now i can make a

1516
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:52,960
judgment as to

1517
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,480
whether that's good enough so one of the

1518
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,280
things that i

1519
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,839
i i don't know how to describe and i and

1520
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:00,400
i'm

1521
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,640
looking for help here is and there's

1522
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,520
there's actually some real

1523
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,280
contradictions here to in this tech

1524
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,680
in this part is one of the obvious

1525
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,039
things that you want to do when

1526
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:13,200
with any of your say factory located

1527
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,240
pki pits is the private keys that you

1528
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,680
use to sign

1529
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,960
the idev ids that go into the device

1530
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,400
well those those private keys they

1531
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,799
remain in your factory

1532
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,760
and the top level probably if you can

1533
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,039
afford it and

1534
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,200
your smart probably goes into some kind

1535
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,160
of a hardware security

1536
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,480
module that's an hsm but they are

1537
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,280
expensive

1538
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,200
and it's not always clear to me that

1539
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,280
they have a specific value

1540
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,760
um and sometimes they're more of a

1541
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,799
hassle

1542
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,839
as well um one of the things you may be

1543
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:50,558
interested is to

1544
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,400
sorry i have to uh i have to close my uh

1545
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,319
uh gather town because it's talking to

1546
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:00,160
me for some reason there we go

1547
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,760
um so the the issue is

1548
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,400
um if you for instance looked at what

1549
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,359
the uh

1550
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,400
root dns people had to do last summer um

1551
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,920
to essentially deal with the fact that

1552
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,520
they actually couldn't have a

1553
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,559
key ceremony due to the pandemic and so

1554
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,480
at one point they under supervision

1555
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,200
drilled

1556
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,000
their some of the data out of there out

1557
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,079
of their safe to be able to continue

1558
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:25,760
and sort of i sort of had to say what

1559
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,200
was the point of having a safe if we

1560
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,000
could just drill

1561
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,079
we could just be allowed uh to drill it

1562
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,440
out and i guess the answer is that we

1563
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,119
knew that they were doing it

1564
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,200
um so you have this crop this quandary

1565
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,480
um on the one hand

1566
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,039
you would be a good idea to divide your

1567
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,079
private information

1568
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,480
into more pieces and have it more

1569
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,960
resiliently available

1570
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,559
maybe on different continents so that

1571
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,240
you can continue to deal things and deal

1572
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,440
with maybe pandemic

1573
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,000
issues to travel on the other hand if

1574
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,760
you have more pieces then there's more

1575
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,440
likelihood that

1576
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,760
some smaller conspiracy of people could

1577
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,440
continue to do something else or the

1578
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,520
fewer number of people you need to

1579
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,400
um need to be the more number of people

1580
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,280
that need to be

1581
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,440
resilient to corruption bribery or

1582
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,400
extortion and

1583
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,640
if it's value due to them again the

1584
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:12,640
point is not to say what is better and

1585
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,559
worse but to understand

1586
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,880
what are the risks so if you're buying

1587
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,599
uh

1588
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,480
uh national id cards as taiwan did a

1589
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,640
decade 20 years ago

1590
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,119
um you probably want to know that they

1591
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:25,680
have good

1592
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,200
cryptographic content and that they

1593
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,000
can't be easily forged and if they can

1594
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,119
then at least you as the national agency

1595
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,280
hold all the cards making that happen i

1596
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,799
mentioned them specifically because it

1597
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,240
turned out that they had issues with

1598
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,160
their private keys were not as random as

1599
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:41,280
they thought they were

1600
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,559
and there's a paper out there that you

1601
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,559
can read it's quite astonishing

1602
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,160
um so this is the question how are you

1603
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,599
going to describe this thing how are you

1604
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,039
going to describe this this level is

1605
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,559
this something that you actually

1606
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:53,520
want to describe as part of this there

1607
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,520
but as an end user you'd kind of like to

1608
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:56,799
know

1609
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:59,280
what are the risks to the supply chain

1610
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,119
maybe not for your

1611
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,720
home webcam maybe that you think you

1612
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,799
don't mat it doesn't matter to you but

1613
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:06,160
maybe you really do care about the

1614
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,000
pieces that go into your

1615
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,440
autonomous vehicle for instance

1616
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,920
so as i described before um a great

1617
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,359
number of this is hidden behind

1618
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:17,280
non-disclosure agreements and you don't

1619
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,880
really know what's what and who's woo

1620
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,760
and they don't

1621
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,160
aren't likely to get behind that so

1622
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,160
that's the goal is not to kind of to

1623
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,760
break that open i'm not trying to say

1624
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,440
okay tell us all your secrets tell us

1625
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,359
what's going on but rather

1626
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,839
that when you hire an auditor or the

1627
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:32,799
company has

1628
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:35,280
provided you with audited resort results

1629
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,079
that you can actually

1630
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,839
read the audit results in an intelligent

1631
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,760
way and this has kind of

1632
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,880
input into the rest of our our security

1633
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,799
uh considerations other documents where

1634
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:46,079
you may actually have to say well this

1635
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,599
is the kind of thing that i would expect

1636
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:48,799
this level of security

1637
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,280
there and you could go and go and find

1638
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,400
out if that actually happened

1639
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,400
and finally i just come back to one of

1640
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,240
the last little things that i started

1641
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:58,720
with

1642
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,280
is that um pretty much you should

1643
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,000
realize that every device out there

1644
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
is going to be

1645
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,400
determined by what software it runs and

1646
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,559
whoever determines what software it runs

1647
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:13,839
probably determines what the

1648
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:14,960
authorizations that

1649
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,559
are that are associated with a

1650
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,319
particular set of trust anchors

1651
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,000
so that's the public keys that you built

1652
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,599
into your device

1653
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,160
um so if you can change that software

1654
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,720
then

1655
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,920
you pretty much uh win and i think this

1656
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,160
is actually one of the places where

1657
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,559
if we were to go through a number of of

1658
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,240
audits and things we would we would

1659
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,160
actually be kind of surprised that some

1660
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,000
of the software signing keys

1661
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,640
are really not as as well secured as we

1662
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,079
thought

1663
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,480
and there was recently an issue with a

1664
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,359
microsoft

1665
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,200
windows active directory management a

1666
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,440
third-party tool i believe

1667
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,880
which had this problem it turned out

1668
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,480
that there there were possibly

1669
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,280
access to that code signing key

1670
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,119
elsewhere it's unclear from the press

1671
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,000
release but the point

1672
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,240
is that if you've got a thing and you

1673
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,839
have this gone through this process of

1674
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,280
trying to make it secure

1675
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,440
and then you hand out your signing key

1676
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,440
to anyone that asks then maybe that's a

1677
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:09,920
problem

1678
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,359
and maybe some of the process that you

1679
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,280
need on top of that but whatever the

1680
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:13,680
case

1681
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,640
my goal is simply to be able to to track

1682
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,319
in a qualitative way

1683
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,480
how you do manage that key and that's

1684
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,039
about it for me

1685
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,079
questions and i would really like this

1686
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,799
document adopted by tdtrg

1687
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,119
that would be great but i also really am

1688
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,119
very anxious to have

1689
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:35,760
additional co-authors and people who

1690
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,720
would like to take this

1691
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,119
out to industry groups and provide some

1692
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,839
focused feedback

1693
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,960
okay questions for michael everybody is

1694
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,640
called michael in this

1695
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,839
group sorry about that

1696
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,039
i don't know if you're managing who's

1697
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:13,119
managing the queue i'll point from there

1698
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:13,520
to

1699
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,599
my client thanks michael it's very very

1700
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,520
interesting piece of work and

1701
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,520
one thing that occurred to me i think

1702
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,120
there's quite a lot of similarities on

1703
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,719
the work milan is doing kind of from the

1704
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,000
iot protocol side

1705
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,560
you're kind of doing the security side

1706
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,439
establishing

1707
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,080
terminals and ways to describe things in

1708
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,279
a uniform way

1709
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,279
so you can actually understand what is

1710
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,719
there inside

1711
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:36,799
um i was wondering maybe there would be

1712
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,319
some alignment even even to be done

1713
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,439
there but

1714
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:40,880
overall it's gonna what are the shares

1715
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,560
let's just fit into sdf is that what

1716
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:42,960
you're

1717
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,759
asking in some level i'm sorry

1718
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,080
that would be an interesting way i mean

1719
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,080
as my goal was not to make this machine

1720
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:55,279
readable but human understandable

1721
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,198
um but at some point in the supply chain

1722
01:08:59,198 --> 01:08:59,920
space

1723
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,359
you actually do need to make this

1724
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,279
machine readable because you get a num

1725
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:05,520
the number of parts that you get and the

1726
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,719
changes to those

1727
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:09,279
parts are the security properties behind

1728
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,319
those parts

1729
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,719
needs to be uh needs to go through a

1730
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,399
supply chain but

1731
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,399
i wouldn't want to try to write it down

1732
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,158
before we actually you know in a machine

1733
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,158
readable format until we had

1734
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,960
um enough examples to make sense of it

1735
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,640
um 1dm had you i've i'm

1736
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,319
just amazed that you guys have 200

1737
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:27,679
models uh

1738
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,158
already and i think that's really

1739
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:31,679
valuable so i wouldn't want to do that

1740
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:32,880
prior to having

1741
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,960
you know at least 20 or 30 descriptions

1742
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,319
in english

1743
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,600
or some other language and before we

1744
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,120
continued but i think that's definitely

1745
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:45,439
sounds like an sdf 2.0 kind of effort

1746
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,880
cool thanks hank

1747
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,199
hi michael yes this is michael um

1748
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,440
sorry i'm very sorry um so

1749
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,760
my question is about slide nine where

1750
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,840
you said uh i don't know if this is a

1751
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,280
tauntology

1752
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,560
and uh i don't know why you want to know

1753
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,199
that so

1754
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:11,840
uh i think it's good to structure things

1755
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,840
kind of i don't know hierarchically and

1756
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,000
then this is like a subclass 3 in a

1757
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,280
taxonomy

1758
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,040
and that's always well that's the first

1759
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,840
step towards ontology modeling i guess

1760
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,239
uh with more narrower and broader uh

1761
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:25,040
terms

1762
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,080
and and maybe that helps to some extent

1763
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,840
so the reason i said i don't know is

1764
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:33,360
that that then i don't know if there's

1765
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,040
enough structure to bother

1766
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,679
um at this point i'm quite happy to just

1767
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,920
put put a bunch of terms in a bag

1768
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,840
and not worry about how they relate to

1769
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,520
each other um

1770
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,719
and uh later on if the like you know

1771
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:48,159
literally that's all the terms that i

1772
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:48,640
have in

1773
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,040
in this thing at this point um when that

1774
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,440
exceeds three pages or three slides then

1775
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,719
i think we're probably it's time to

1776
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,239
structure it in some way

1777
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,400
um but i know if you look through the

1778
01:10:58,400 --> 01:10:59,440
document there are

1779
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,199
you know parts that relate to trust

1780
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:02,880
anchors and parts that relate to private

1781
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:05,440
keys but that's just really how they do

1782
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,560
um so i'm not i guess part of the point

1783
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:08,960
is that

1784
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,880
i don't really want to argue about how

1785
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,159
what's similar to what's

1786
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,159
what other thing i just really want to

1787
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:16,640
get the terminology down in a way that

1788
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,760
um i can reasonably find out for devices

1789
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,320
that

1790
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,480
i own or parts that i want to include in

1791
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,640
devices that i'm building

1792
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,199
how they are managed and how it happens

1793
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:27,840
right

1794
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,880
um and and that some of these questions

1795
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,440
could be answered

1796
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,520
okay yeah i agree with only models

1797
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,199
things you need and not because they're

1798
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,800
just true or somehow there

1799
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,320
so it would be a very boring tree if

1800
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,560
just a depth of one or two maybe and

1801
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:43,600
then i don't know what

1802
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,239
that what what's the purpose but um and

1803
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:46,960
then again

1804
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,120
uh you're at the right place i think

1805
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,000
when you have to want this

1806
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,080
semantic dependencies like i need the

1807
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,120
location

1808
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,239
and a key is in there and and it can be

1809
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,080
private and it's used for

1810
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,760
and all these semantic relationships

1811
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,440
between um

1812
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,440
these terms that might actually become

1813
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,040
an interesting thing to consume

1814
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,320
for other uh stakeholders um so i would

1815
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,440
keep that in mind

1816
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,800
and and just as a um uh uh

1817
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,960
first question so to speak um at the

1818
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,320
very beginning you were talking about

1819
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,280
and i think it's

1820
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,280
excellent to bring that up to confuse

1821
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,199
what actually well-defined things like

1822
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,800
root of trust and trust anchor

1823
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,560
and and looking at the document i think

1824
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,480
you're not opening that kind of worms

1825
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:26,960
there

1826
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:30,080
right you're not introducing

1827
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,679
these two categories there's two

1828
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,199
categories of things

1829
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:36,719
that we need to discuss right but um

1830
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,159
um there's there's the private keys that

1831
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:41,920
are in your devices

1832
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,960
which turn out to be your roots of trust

1833
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,960
okay but then there's the private keys

1834
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:49,040
which are in your factories

1835
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:51,840
which are which are are not the same

1836
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,480
thing

1837
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:54,159
but they lead to the trust anchors that

1838
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:55,840
are in your devices

1839
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,320
so both cases though the discussion of

1840
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,520
how is the private key

1841
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,719
uh protected and who had access to it

1842
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,000
and how is it generated well

1843
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
that's that actually applies to both

1844
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,600
just the types of the answers you get

1845
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,320
are different

1846
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,080
right like the number how how many

1847
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,760
people have access to the private key in

1848
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,800
the device

1849
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,880
i hope is zero how many people have

1850
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,600
access to the private key in the hsm

1851
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,159
well it's probably also zero but it

1852
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:21,760
might actually be four

1853
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,360
where those are the two four people that

1854
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,960
can reconstruct it

1855
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:28,159
okay um so there's there's some real

1856
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,840
i think you know questions that are

1857
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,320
similar

1858
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,440
yeah okay so so maybe uh it is

1859
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,000
worth at least considering uh opening

1860
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,520
that kind of worms and actually

1861
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,440
pull in the term root of trust into your

1862
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,440
document but i'm not sure if that's

1863
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,640
useful so just just

1864
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,920
as a food for thought well

1865
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,760
okay yeah and so hard it's been so hard

1866
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,520
to define it in other documents i i'm

1867
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,560
reluctant to

1868
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,719
to even pick it yeah it's it's it's it's

1869
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,719
being covered now i think so i think

1870
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:57,600
that's another big

1871
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,760
uh big big big discrepancy for the world

1872
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,960
but i'm really

1873
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,800
like this is the flood of cars now so do

1874
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,239
you think that we

1875
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,920
this document should go to the point of

1876
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,960
organizing this into a yang module

1877
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,000
oh my god i don't think so i mean it's

1878
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,320
just

1879
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,080
but it's just properties with keys right

1880
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,920
and that seems to be what 90 percent of

1881
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,199
yang modules are

1882
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:19,280
um yeah i don't see an advantage at this

1883
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:20,960
point to doing that

1884
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:24,560
no i would also not try that

1885
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,040
there is a reason that sdf is not a yang

1886
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,320
model

1887
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,040
but that's that wasn't the point i was

1888
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,159
going to make

1889
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,120
um so the reason why i think it's really

1890
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,760
worth thinking about modeling

1891
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,480
this is that in a large network i need

1892
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,640
to find out what's in there

1893
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,640
and as most people who actually have

1894
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,679
worked with enterprise networks know

1895
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:55,520
nobody has any idea what is in an

1896
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,760
enterprise network

1897
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,560
and there are some activities like the

1898
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,880
the software bill of materials

1899
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,239
and and the software id cosworth

1900
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:09,600
activities that try to find out

1901
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,320
what software is in there what software

1902
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,239
am i trusting when i

1903
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,280
allow this thing into my my network

1904
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,880
and i think that having a way to

1905
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,080
document

1906
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,640
what are the the trust relationships to

1907
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,920
uh entities that that do things like

1908
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:33,679
like uh certify um

1909
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,520
key pairs and and the the trust anchors

1910
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,600
out there and so on

1911
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,719
um that may be a useful thing so

1912
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,440
so after a solar wind thing or a

1913
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,280
microsoft exchange thing

1914
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,520
i i can look into my network and find

1915
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:52,480
out in a limited amount of time who is

1916
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,679
actually

1917
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,000
impacted by this and which part of my

1918
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
factory do i have to shut down because i

1919
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,120
no longer have control over it

1920
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,120
and that's why i think modeling these

1921
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,199
security

1922
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,839
relationships is really so important

1923
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,239
yeah so um i like i i

1924
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,480
i'd like to have a conversation on the

1925
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,280
list i guess

1926
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,000
about what level of modeling you think

1927
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,199
is appropriate um

1928
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,360
and and how you know because what i'm

1929
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,800
hearing is that we would like to be able

1930
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:25,120
to

1931
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:28,640
point to particular um

1932
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,679
profiles of this model um

1933
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,760
that would be asserted by a manufacturer

1934
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:35,600
we are following this model blah blah

1935
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,440
blah and a coastwood wants to be able to

1936
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,520
point at or some other an spdx or

1937
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,640
something wants to be able to

1938
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,920
po point at this um but

1939
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,960
um yeah yeah but

1940
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,440
that talks about software and and

1941
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,280
software is not the only thing in which

1942
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:51,600
you

1943
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,520
it's not the only thing i mean i mean it

1944
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,040
also applies to to

1945
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,600
you know the the who signed the firmware

1946
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,120
in your keyboard

1947
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,480
right in the microcontroller of your

1948
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,960
keyboard right so um

1949
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,960
and did they even think that was an

1950
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,080
important key to keep private

1951
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,320
but

1952
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,920
yeah so there's a whole area of uh

1953
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,000
work waiting for us uh bringing all

1954
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,440
these various models

1955
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,040
uh uh sdf uh yang

1956
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,400
uh the mud uh various pieces of mud

1957
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,480
information that's out there there

1958
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,760
and so on together so we can do useful

1959
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,040
inferences

1960
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,800
uh from that information at the security

1961
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,159
layer well i would propose that we flush

1962
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:43,199
out some more bits in this document

1963
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:46,320
that we think about what other other um

1964
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,719
questions like the how do i explain the

1965
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:49,840
k of n

1966
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,440
um for recovery uh process

1967
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,199
there um that that we publish an initial

1968
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,640
document and then we come back and

1969
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,520
discuss

1970
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,360
well how do we arrange this into a model

1971
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,640
that we can do this other

1972
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,560
other you know do things that are

1973
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,239
machine uh readable

1974
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,239
um but i really think that that the

1975
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:10,080
ideal thing is that we were able to talk

1976
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,440
to people and say

1977
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,679
you know can you describe it in this

1978
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,520
using this terminology

1979
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,560
um and then uh and then we can use those

1980
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,640
examples to encode our examples or use

1981
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,920
cases for the second

1982
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,280
uh thing aaron you had no

1983
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:27,840
no

1984
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,080
someone else wanted to yeah i wasn't

1985
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,560
suggesting that that all the

1986
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,520
that big area i talked about needs to be

1987
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,280
covered by this document i think

1988
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,440
that you have chosen a really

1989
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,880
interesting

1990
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,000
angle to to make a crack

1991
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,199
uh into that area and that that's why i

1992
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,120
think it's it's a very useful document

1993
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,320
to look at

1994
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,640
but i also would like us to think about

1995
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,520
the larger area and see what other

1996
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,679
components can can we actually work on

1997
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,280
to to make

1998
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,520
that vision of finding out what's going

1999
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,880
on in my network

2000
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:09,600
uh actually happen at some point

2001
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,080
okay thank you i'm gonna start a couple

2002
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,199
more threads on the list

2003
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,679
um but uh thank you for the discussion

2004
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:16,320
yeah

2005
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:18,400
so you just mentioned aaron probably

2006
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,760
because he just

2007
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,040
mistyped something or

2008
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,280
press the wrong button but aaron is for

2009
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,480
instance one of the

2010
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,520
researchers that i know who has done

2011
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,080
work in

2012
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,560
in this space and that's good to see

2013
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,000
that

2014
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,360
these people are here and looking at

2015
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,000
what we are doing

2016
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,920
all right thank you to do another talk

2017
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,960
at dnsop

2018
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,199
thanks

2019
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,640
thank you we have used up 10 minutes of

2020
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,239
our 20 minutes of

2021
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,920
uh flex time and with that

2022
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,679
uh the next uh talk is the iot edge

2023
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:00,960
challenges and functions

2024
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,360
so yeah do you want to present or do you

2025
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,120
want me or you want to present

2026
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:09,679
so i just press here

2027
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,920
oh while we are waiting for that to come

2028
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:14,560
up

2029
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,840
i have a little poll for you um so can

2030
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,360
can you press the sixth button on top of

2031
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,120
your screen the one that has turned

2032
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,320
yellow

2033
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,759
and answer the question there

2034
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,440
so if you know you have read it you can

2035
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,280
raise your hand if you know you have not

2036
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,719
read it you can

2037
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:38,480
do not raise your hand and if you don't

2038
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,320
remember whether you read it you don't

2039
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:47,840
press either of the buttons

2040
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,360
okay so about half of the participants

2041
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:05,679
has

2042
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,120
answered uh now

2043
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,239
and so we have a gauge and i hope this

2044
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:14,480
discussion has motivated you

2045
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:16,800
uh the ones who did not raise them to

2046
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,239
actually locate it

2047
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:23,360
thank you so on to savvy

2048
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,040
uh thank you yeah so uh i'd like to uh

2049
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,360
yeah

2050
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,210
present recent updates

2051
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:30,480
[Music]

2052
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:34,559
on the draft iot edge computing

2053
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,000
right so the last time we met in itf 108

2054
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,360
so we started the rg adoption process

2055
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,760
and the following august we released

2056
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:46,880
version zero

2057
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,880
and a couple of months later a minor

2058
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,400
update so these

2059
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,320
revisions address comments from people

2060
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,080
who made technical comments during the

2061
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,120
adoption process

2062
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,840
you know there were two so mary jose and

2063
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,199
carlos

2064
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:03,520
and in this presentation so thank you

2065
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,280
for the reviews

2066
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,520
and the in this presentation i will uh

2067
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,480
summarize

2068
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:13,599
the uh update and discuss the next steps

2069
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:18,480
so both reviewers recommended adding

2070
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,520
new use cases so we added use cases on

2071
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,719
smart factory

2072
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,560
agriculture self-driving car and ar vr

2073
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,320
those are very high level use cases

2074
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,560
we also added text in the introduction

2075
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,600
about our focus on research topics

2076
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,639
rather than industry projects so

2077
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:42,239
we still have like a section 4.1

2078
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,120
that represents the current state of iot

2079
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,920
computing in

2080
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,000
industry but it does not dive into

2081
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,360
individual projects and

2082
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,280
doesn't list them we're just trying to

2083
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,880
provide a high level view

2084
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,560
right and we spend most of the rest of

2085
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:58,800
the section for example to speaking

2086
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,679
about

2087
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,440
individual research challenges so it's

2088
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,320
more focused on this

2089
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,360
on this side of things um

2090
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,080
other comments uh on the specific text

2091
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,520
were addressed as well so

2092
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,400
um we had an update on the description

2093
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,639
of an in-network computation

2094
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:18,320
which was a bit too narrow and we also

2095
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,400
added data discovery as a research

2096
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,679
challenge

2097
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,239
and we did quite a you know a few

2098
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:27,678
editorial changes as well

2099
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,520
right so uh since so you know in the

2100
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,520
next and last slide we will ask

2101
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,040
people who are interested to provide

2102
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:40,000
some feedback so i'd like to give uh

2103
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,360
you know a quick overview of the

2104
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,920
document and to highlight

2105
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,840
what was updated most recently so of

2106
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:47,760
course we welcome comments on

2107
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:49,199
any part of the document on the

2108
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,360
structure on anything you you think is

2109
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,239
worth it uh however you know the the

2110
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,719
parts that are highlighted here

2111
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:59,600
uh will benefit from you know most from

2112
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,960
reviews

2113
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,480
right so beyond the introduction in

2114
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,000
section 2

2115
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,560
we have a quite mature text with a high

2116
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,239
level descriptions of iot cloud

2117
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,000
computing edge computing

2118
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,280
and we have a few new use cases

2119
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:17,199
section 3 is quite stable i think

2120
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,760
you know it lists reasons that motivate

2121
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,400
the use

2122
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:23,440
of edge computing for iot it has been

2123
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,040
reviewed a couple of times it has been

2124
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,719
discussed in t2 trg

2125
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,960
even before starting this draft you know

2126
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,800
by some co-authors

2127
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,239
so it should be relatively stable at

2128
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,280
least

2129
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:38,639
and section 4 has more recent text

2130
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,440
so the the overview part we already

2131
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,719
discussed that

2132
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:45,840
earlier it's it covers a very dynamic

2133
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,880
field

2134
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,120
so people who are involved in this

2135
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,800
domain or are interested in some part of

2136
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,480
this domain

2137
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,920
may have like good input here to maybe

2138
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,000
update some parts or improve the text

2139
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,120
there

2140
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,480
and following that we have a model which

2141
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,280
is very

2142
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,480
very general so in its we think it needs

2143
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,239
to be general to cover you know very

2144
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:09,840
different system designs in this

2145
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,639
in this field uh however you know for

2146
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,120
example one possibility would be uh

2147
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,000
if you are aware of some uh models for

2148
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,159
iot-h computing which could be uh

2149
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:23,120
it could bring some additional value you

2150
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,600
know we could point towards them

2151
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,600
or you know could improve the model in

2152
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,880
some way

2153
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,000
then we have one section per function or

2154
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,679
component

2155
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:36,480
and each section has a description text

2156
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,800
and a list of research challenges so

2157
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,880
this part is relatively recent and it

2158
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,000
would benefit from

2159
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,719
really more reviews you know feel free

2160
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:45,600
to

2161
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,800
propose new research areas

2162
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,960
in there or new functions that we may

2163
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,920
have missed or

2164
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,960
we can adapt some functions to cover

2165
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,000
to better cover what's needed and then

2166
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,440
we have text and simulation and

2167
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,280
emulation environment and security

2168
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:04,800
considerations right so this is the last

2169
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,639
slide so to our knowledge

2170
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,600
all outstanding comments are addressed

2171
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,639
the draft is in the stable state and

2172
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,400
you know we you know it's ready to be

2173
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,719
reviewed as a group draft so please

2174
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,159
feel free to provide feedback you know

2175
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,440
if you are interested on the mailing

2176
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,159
list

2177
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:22,400
even you know if you don't have a lot of

2178
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,520
time i mean

2179
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,360
you know this document is not very long

2180
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,040
it's still 20 pages but if you want to

2181
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,679
focus really on some parts of interest

2182
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,760
you can just do that and you know

2183
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,080
finally we also had a discussion among

2184
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,120
co-authors and

2185
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,880
group chairs about reaching out to a

2186
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,320
wider group of

2187
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,600
reviewers so uh either you know

2188
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:45,840
in parallel with the reviews in t2 trg

2189
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,800
or maybe later

2190
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:49,520
i don't know a first possibility is to

2191
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,280
reach out to irtf groups

2192
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,840
so related groups will include for

2193
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,679
example core energy and energy

2194
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,159
for some aspects and a second

2195
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,840
possibility is to reach out

2196
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,800
to participants in external industry

2197
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,320
forums you know through

2198
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:07,360
personal contacts um you know

2199
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,560
for example you know in cmx you know

2200
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,040
some

2201
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,679
some uh there is some sub group looking

2202
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:14,639
at iot

2203
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,360
api so we could do that for example uh

2204
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,320
we

2205
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,400
so any you know feedback on this or

2206
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,639
anything would be a welcome

2207
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:26,080
uh so thank you for your time and

2208
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,639
that's it for the presentation is

2209
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:29,199
complete

2210
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:33,840
thank you thank you so here

2211
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,000
so any questions too so yeah

2212
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,679
so i have put out a poll again the the

2213
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,840
sixth button should be yellow on your

2214
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,360
screens and

2215
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,000
you can go to that poll and answer my

2216
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
question are you interested in

2217
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:01,840
providing comments on the draft

2218
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,560
okay one of the advantages of the

2219
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,600
physical situation in the room that is

2220
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,360
that when you do a show of hands

2221
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,199
you actually can see who is showing

2222
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:27,280
dance and unfortunately

2223
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,920
with a poll i can't but there are seven

2224
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,040
hands up

2225
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,800
right now which i think is is

2226
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,400
approximately

2227
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,520
the amount of review we we uh

2228
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,719
need to get this completed so if people

2229
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:41,199
plus

2230
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,120
could please remember that they raised

2231
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:44,960
their hand here and uh

2232
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,239
actually provide some form of review

2233
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,400
some form of comments

2234
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,400
uh that that would be great so we can

2235
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,400
advance

2236
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,159
this document so this summary is uh

2237
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,159
six people think they won't provide

2238
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,280
comments seven people

2239
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,280
think they will uh and everybody else is

2240
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,520
still making up their mind

2241
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,679
yeah thank you i just would like to say

2242
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,199
yeah if it's even

2243
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:17,840
you know feedback on a short part of the

2244
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,080
document it would still be very

2245
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,520
valuable so thank you yeah so the idea

2246
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,080
is

2247
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,120
is not so much that you put an item on

2248
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,880
your calendar that you do a full review

2249
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,080
of the document

2250
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:33,040
that's also great uh but uh it's it's

2251
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,159
also useful

2252
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,480
to to simply look at an area of the

2253
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,400
document where you

2254
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,639
maybe have some some previous experience

2255
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:42,880
with and and can

2256
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:46,880
send some comments to the mailing list

2257
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:53,199
okay so thank you so here we are still

2258
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:56,239
10 minutes uh into

2259
01:29:56,239 --> 01:29:59,840
our flex time budget so the

2260
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,239
next speaker is mohit

2261
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:05,920
on the bootstrapping terminology

2262
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,400
document

2263
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,480
okay the screen share should be starting

2264
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,000
do you have to press a button on your

2265
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,840
side

2266
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:41,040
ah great hi can you hear me

2267
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,560
yes thank you excellent so

2268
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,880
uh i just finished to check this

2269
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,000
dispatch and

2270
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,159
joined now sorry that i was in two

2271
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,280
places

2272
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,880
uh so yeah i'll be presenting our draft

2273
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,040
on secure iot bootstrapping

2274
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,320
uh we started this as a survey

2275
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,760
and i'm mohit uh this was work done

2276
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,840
together with my co-authors bechet

2277
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,199
and dan and various other contributors

2278
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:13,040
so just to recap uh this draft was

2279
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,920
well exactly like five years ago version

2280
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,440
zero zero was submitted so in march 2016

2281
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,760
this has been around for a while and

2282
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,719
obviously has

2283
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,600
been undergoing changes uh since the

2284
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,560
beginning

2285
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:29,560
so we have added definitions you know

2286
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,840
classifications and and

2287
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,120
the new part added in the last year has

2288
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,520
been the bootstrapping terminology so

2289
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,920
a lot of the contents were written even

2290
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:40,960
before

2291
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,440
many of the protocols that are being

2292
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:44,000
developed

2293
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,280
now existed so i'll be presenting

2294
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,159
version 11

2295
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:51,840
11 of the draft today

2296
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,239
so one thing we wanted to cover uh in

2297
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,080
this draft is that

2298
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,239
there's various terminology that is kind

2299
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:00,800
of interrelated and is used a little bit

2300
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,679
uh freely uh although we are not sure we

2301
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,520
completely understand the relationship

2302
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,480
between the different

2303
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,719
terminologies and how different

2304
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,239
standards bodies are

2305
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:13,360
are using those terms so

2306
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,000
one of the goals of this draft was to

2307
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,239
find the terminology and then also try

2308
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:19,840
to document what

2309
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,920
are the terminologies used by the

2310
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,920
different sdos including

2311
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:26,960
ietf but also outside the itf

2312
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,920
so here's a list i might have missed but

2313
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,120
i think this is

2314
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,400
get soon getting exhaustive

2315
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,400
so we have bootstrapping provisioning

2316
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,840
onboarding enrollment commissioning

2317
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,280
initialization configuration

2318
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,719
registration and

2319
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:46,159
discovery and in the next few slides

2320
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,840
i'll just be going through some of the

2321
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,120
example

2322
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:51,920
protocols or systems and what kind of

2323
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,600
terms they are using

2324
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,159
so the first one i have on the list is

2325
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:57,199
dpp

2326
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:59,520
hopefully some of you know wi-fi

2327
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,400
alliance device provisioning protocol

2328
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,880
i saw dan as one of the attendees so

2329
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,760
he's

2330
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,960
i guess one of the main authors of dpp

2331
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,040
hopefully dan you can correct me if i

2332
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,080
have

2333
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,480
not written the summary correctly but

2334
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,440
dpp

2335
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,280
at least in the spec has the following

2336
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,679
three sub protocols or phases

2337
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:22,000
the first is bootstrapping where

2338
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,800
basically

2339
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,880
you obtain the public key of the other

2340
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,400
party so this can be

2341
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,480
through scanning a qr code or tapping

2342
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:29,520
nfc

2343
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:33,280
or some other form of out of band

2344
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,920
communication once you have done that

2345
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,840
you can do authentication

2346
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,679
so there's at least authentication of

2347
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:42,639
the responder

2348
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:45,520
to the initiator but optionally there is

2349
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:46,800
also mutual

2350
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:49,120
authentication so if you have scanned qr

2351
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,040
codes in both directions then you can

2352
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:51,520
get

2353
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,880
mutual authentication there's a couple

2354
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,000
of different terms

2355
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,880
used in this in the spec so there's the

2356
01:33:58,880 --> 01:33:59,280
in

2357
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,120
in row configurator enrollee

2358
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,520
and roller and there's the initiator and

2359
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,639
responder but

2360
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:09,199
i guess the important ones are here

2361
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:09,760
colored

2362
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,280
so there's the bootstrapping

2363
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,480
authentication and then the

2364
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,159
configuration so once

2365
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:17,199
the parties are authenticated the

2366
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,040
configurator which is typically your

2367
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,880
smartphone application can send

2368
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:21,920
information

2369
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,040
such as the ssid and passphrase to

2370
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,320
the new iot device

2371
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,960
then the draft also covers uh omar

2372
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,159
lightweight m2m

2373
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:38,159
so oma's design is basically a new

2374
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:38,960
device

2375
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,600
contacts a bootstrap server which is

2376
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,440
responsible for provisioning

2377
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,320
information such as credentials and once

2378
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,760
the device

2379
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,520
receives these credentials and

2380
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,760
information it then registers

2381
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:54,639
itself to one of the lightweight m2m

2382
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,320
servers which will then manage

2383
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,679
the device during its life cycle

2384
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:02,800
the specification defines

2385
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,719
four different ways of bootstrapping you

2386
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:06,400
have factory bootstrap where

2387
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,560
like the credentials are already

2388
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:10,159
pre-provisioned

2389
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,920
into the device at the time of

2390
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,159
manufacturer in that case the device

2391
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:16,080
doesn't really need a bootstrap server

2392
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,239
it can directly contact the

2393
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,639
lightweight m2m server then there is

2394
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:21,920
options of

2395
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,000
bootstrapping through a smart card there

2396
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,280
is client initiative

2397
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:29,360
bootstrap and server initiated bootstrap

2398
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,159
in the draft i also or we have also

2399
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:32,960
written about

2400
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,000
ocf but i thought for brevity in the

2401
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,199
presentation

2402
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,760
i'm not presenting the terminology used

2403
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,040
by ocf

2404
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:43,440
here instead i thought it might be

2405
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,239
interesting to

2406
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,600
cover what fido is doing uh so

2407
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,119
fido alliance has uh auto automatic

2408
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:52,400
onboarding protocol

2409
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:55,760
and is using lots of ietf specifications

2410
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,800
like

2411
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,000
uh eat and seaborg

2412
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,199
so basically they're they're what fedo

2413
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:04,880
is trying to do is provide the iot

2414
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:05,679
device with

2415
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:08,239
sufficient information so that it can

2416
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:10,960
interact with an online cloud

2417
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:13,360
platform typically hosted in in a cloud

2418
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:14,080
so

2419
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,199
think of some amazon or azure platform

2420
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,760
but my understanding at least of reading

2421
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,440
the specification is

2422
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:23,840
that the problem of network connectivity

2423
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:25,280
is not really solved by the

2424
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,199
protocol and the protocol assumes that

2425
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,800
the device has already joined the

2426
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:29,840
network

2427
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,760
joining the network doesn't necessarily

2428
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,280
mean that it has joined

2429
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,760
the internet but at least it has some

2430
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,719
network connectivity one of the features

2431
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,719
that fido alliance claims to

2432
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,840
bring to the table is late binding so

2433
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:44,880
basically

2434
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,719
the concept here is that owners can

2435
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,360
choose owners of iot devices can choose

2436
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:49,760
the

2437
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,080
platform to which their device would

2438
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,920
connect to at quite a late

2439
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:57,360
stage in in the device life cycle

2440
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,320
the protocol is again as as you can

2441
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,000
expect is composed of

2442
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,400
of sever several sub protocols so

2443
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,239
there's the device initialization

2444
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:07,199
protocol

2445
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,360
which is executed in the factory and

2446
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:10,400
here

2447
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,040
the initial ownership and manufacturing

2448
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,159
credentials are

2449
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:17,840
placed typically in a secure storage

2450
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,199
like a tpm uh then you have transfer of

2451
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:21,840
ownership

2452
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,679
protocols and there are three of them so

2453
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:29,119
here they are written as to0 1 and 2

2454
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:32,000
and these protocols occur between the

2455
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,199
device

2456
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:35,679
a rendezvous server and an owner

2457
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,040
onboarding service

2458
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,159
and the whole idea is that once these

2459
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:42,239
transfer of ownership protocols are

2460
01:37:42,239 --> 01:37:45,520
completed the new owner of iot device

2461
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,840
and the new and the device have

2462
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,679
authenticated each other

2463
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,760
and once this authentication is complete

2464
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,440
the owner can obviously provide

2465
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,239
cryptographic information and urls to

2466
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,440
the device

2467
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,560
uh of of the iot platform to which

2468
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,840
it should connect

2469
01:38:04,239 --> 01:38:07,920
so these were some of the standards work

2470
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:08,639
that is going

2471
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,199
outside the ietf but obviously we have

2472
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,040
lots of bootstrapping related

2473
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,719
protocols that have been developed at

2474
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,960
the ietf so we have

2475
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,600
est i'm sure some of you are familiar

2476
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,000
with

2477
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,840
enrollment over secure transport

2478
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,560
specified in rfc 7030

2479
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,199
it's a profile of certificate management

2480
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:28,480
over cms

2481
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,880
if you're wondering what is cms it's

2482
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,159
cryptographic

2483
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:36,639
message syntax so many new acronyms to

2484
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:39,280
learn here but the idea is simple that

2485
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,280
client devices can obtain client

2486
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,600
certificates and associate

2487
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,239
associated ca certificates and

2488
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:47,760
originally it was

2489
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:51,360
specified with interactions over http

2490
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:53,600
but thanks to this working group there

2491
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,719
is now a companion

2492
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:56,800
specification that defines how est can

2493
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,400
also be transported over

2494
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,560
co-op one interesting thing in rfc 7030

2495
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,199
is

2496
01:39:03,199 --> 01:39:06,320
it allows you to bootstrap

2497
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,560
basically devices which have minimal

2498
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,000
configuration so if you have no

2499
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,239
credentials on the device then you can

2500
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:15,440
rely on the human user and the idea here

2501
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,360
is that the human user can verify

2502
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:20,239
information such as the ca certificate

2503
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:23,440
with the fingerprint shown over

2504
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,639
an authenticated tls channel so you can

2505
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,119
set up an authenticated tls channel and

2506
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:31,119
show the user that this is the ca you

2507
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:32,719
are interacting with do you want to

2508
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:35,360
request a client certificate from there

2509
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,520
and after successful bootstrapping you

2510
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,639
can proceed

2511
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:42,159
with enrollment there's also

2512
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:45,440
brewski so bootstrapping remotes secure

2513
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,800
key infrastructure

2514
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,080
which uses a221ar vendor certificates on

2515
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,119
the device

2516
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:54,239
and the device performs several steps so

2517
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:57,280
first it discovers a register it

2518
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,840
identifies to a registrar then it

2519
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,880
requests to join if the registrar has

2520
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:03,690
the

2521
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:04,800
[Music]

2522
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,600
needed connectivity to the masa masa is

2523
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,080
basically

2524
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,600
something that is hosted by the

2525
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,440
manufacturer

2526
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,480
it can imprint and then use est to

2527
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,199
actually get

2528
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:18,239
certificates and enroll

2529
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:21,280
one thing that brewski does in addition

2530
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,960
is that it can work with link local

2531
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,639
connectivity and it doesn't really

2532
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:27,600
require a rootable address

2533
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,480
however as i stated there is this need

2534
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,440
of having a

2535
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,800
masa which basically is a is a

2536
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,480
internet-based service that the

2537
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,320
typically device

2538
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,480
manufacturer would be hosting not

2539
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:41,679
necessarily but

2540
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,800
at least someone should be hosting this

2541
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,480
masa on on the internet

2542
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,280
and finally we have satp secure zero

2543
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,480
touch provisioning

2544
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,600
and the rfc 8572

2545
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,400
calls it a bootstrapping strategy which

2546
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,080
enables a device to obtain

2547
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,840
bootstrapping data with no to minimal

2548
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,199
installer action uh the rfc defines

2549
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,280
several ways of obtaining this bootstrap

2550
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,800
data so you have dns

2551
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,320
dhcp removable storage or from a

2552
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,560
bootstrap server

2553
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:20,880
the draft also uses the term onboarding

2554
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,040
server oh sorry i should not call it a

2555
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:23,760
draft it's

2556
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,800
rfc so the rfc also uses the term

2557
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,520
uh onboarding server which is basically

2558
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,960
a bootstrap server that

2559
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,840
returns onboarding information there's

2560
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:34,960
also

2561
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,360
something called as a redirecting server

2562
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,199
but i thought that was not so important

2563
01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:39,920
to cover

2564
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:42,320
in the slides here that is very simple

2565
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,360
that

2566
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,679
if if you receive some information that

2567
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:47,840
is untrusted then

2568
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,560
either it has to be signed or it it can

2569
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,800
only be processed provisionally so you

2570
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,880
can either be redirected to some other

2571
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,679
place

2572
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,679
or you should receive information that

2573
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,840
is signed and you can verify

2574
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,960
so now that we have seen all this fancy

2575
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,000
terminology

2576
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,400
in action how the different seos are are

2577
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,480
using it so what what was the key

2578
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,280
lessons or

2579
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:14,159
take away from this well at least our

2580
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,280
understanding is

2581
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,840
that there are several stages before a

2582
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,040
device can become

2583
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,920
fully operational and this typically

2584
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,400
involves establishing some initial trust

2585
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,320
after which you kind of provision or

2586
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,400
configure the device

2587
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:31,600
so for example in dpp bootstrapping is

2588
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,199
the first step then there is

2589
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:35,360
authentication and then you provision

2590
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:38,719
credentials onto the device similarly in

2591
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,960
est bootstrapping happens as the first

2592
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,480
step when client has no

2593
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:44,960
credentials available but once there are

2594
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,719
some credentials you do the

2595
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:50,159
enrollment and receive certificates

2596
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:52,320
obviously some protocols only deal with

2597
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,639
parts of the process whereas like some

2598
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:57,280
other sdos build entire systems

2599
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,440
where you not only provision credentials

2600
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,600
but you provision access control lists

2601
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:01,920
and

2602
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,639
and so on so omar for example is

2603
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,360
something that not only is provisioning

2604
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,760
urls and credentials but also access

2605
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,600
control lists and other types of

2606
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,239
configuration objects

2607
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:17,360
and here i have just one example of a

2608
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,920
protocol that that uses

2609
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,199
tls and does

2610
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:25,040
bootstrapping but then leaves the

2611
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,119
provisioning of access control lifts

2612
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:31,360
to to another protocol

2613
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,360
uh please join the queue i can't

2614
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,679
i can't see the queue but feel free to

2615
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,040
stop me at any point

2616
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,520
there are slight numbers so hopefully

2617
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,800
you can always

2618
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:45,119
take me back to some slide if you have

2619
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,840
have questions

2620
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,800
so the draft doesn't stop here there's

2621
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,480
after all this terminology

2622
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:54,719
discussion from various seos we try to

2623
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:55,760
do a survey

2624
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,920
an obvious problem with with writing

2625
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,880
services

2626
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,560
like there's uh tens if not hundreds of

2627
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,920
protocols and

2628
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,040
and specifications to cover so uh you

2629
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,719
don't try to cover all of them but

2630
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:10,719
rather try to classify them

2631
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:12,639
so the draft currently has this

2632
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:13,920
classification

2633
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:16,960
uh technique where we classify things

2634
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,080
into managed

2635
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,960
p2p and ad hoc uh leap of faith and

2636
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,040
opportunistic protocols as well as

2637
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,080
hybrid

2638
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,199
and one of the key takeaways is that

2639
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,760
obviously categorization is not always

2640
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:30,800
easy or clear

2641
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,639
so protocol might fall in some version

2642
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,960
it might fall in one category and in

2643
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,960
another version it might fall in another

2644
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,000
category

2645
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,480
but at least it gives you an idea of

2646
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,080
trying to classify

2647
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:46,840
different protocols in in different

2648
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,119
categories

2649
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:52,400
this is uh our last slide so

2650
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:54,400
obviously this draft has been here for

2651
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,840
five years and

2652
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,960
the authors think that uh it's very far

2653
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,639
away from publication but

2654
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:03,520
super ready for adoption and one

2655
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:04,320
question is

2656
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:07,360
uh is the title reflective of the

2657
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,960
content because now

2658
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,119
it's not just a survey of bootstrapping

2659
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:12,400
procos but also

2660
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,280
bootstrapping terminology and it goes a

2661
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,119
little bit beyond that and tries to

2662
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:19,199
understand the relationship between the

2663
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,400
bootstrapping terminology with that

2664
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:26,159
this is my last slide i'm up for

2665
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,720
questions

2666
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:34,020
[Applause]

2667
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,840
go ahead henry thank you carsten

2668
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:41,119
um very very interesting talk as i was

2669
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:42,560
listening to this i couldn't help

2670
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,400
wondering whether there's been any

2671
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:46,000
thought about

2672
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,080
the performance implications of

2673
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,920
enrollment and onboarding and whether if

2674
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,040
people have thought about the

2675
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,600
performance requirements with for these

2676
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,679
for different kinds of devices i could

2677
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:57,760
see a scenario where a device fails and

2678
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,520
you need to bring a replacement on very

2679
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,320
quickly

2680
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,320
but if the enrollment time is an hour

2681
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:05,199
that's not so good

2682
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,560
well at least this draft has not taken

2683
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,440
any position

2684
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,960
on any of those aspects so

2685
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,800
uh as from my slides it was evident some

2686
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,639
protocols require a human

2687
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:20,800
so if you're scanning a qr code then

2688
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,040
that's a different user experience

2689
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,400
then let's say uh for example zero touch

2690
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,639
provisioning where there is no human

2691
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:31,360
and the costs of failing and retrying

2692
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,280
obviously are different whether you have

2693
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,520
to take out a app and scan again

2694
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:37,679
or whether you are just really trying on

2695
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:38,719
the network

2696
01:46:38,719 --> 01:46:41,119
but at least this draft has not gone

2697
01:46:41,119 --> 01:46:42,960
into trying to distinguish

2698
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:47,280
uh those aspects we might uh

2699
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,480
run into problems in in trying to do

2700
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:51,040
that

2701
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,679
especially if we actually like run

2702
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,239
prototypes and try to collect actual

2703
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:58,080
data from from the network i'm not

2704
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,600
saying it should not be done it would be

2705
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:01,119
pretty interesting but

2706
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:05,199
so far that draft has not not done that

2707
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:09,839
thank you

2708
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:14,560
aaron okay yeah can you hear me now

2709
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,679
yes yeah okay yeah very nice work so

2710
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:19,360
i have been actually following these

2711
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,520
parts for a while i noticed that in the

2712
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:23,040
recent versions

2713
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,040
uh there is a bluetooth section you

2714
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,880
added there in i don't know

2715
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,880
since the version 6 or somewhere but

2716
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,480
then it has been there for a while so i

2717
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:32,000
was wondering since you want to

2718
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,080
bring this further it's a nice work but

2719
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:35,199
then at which point

2720
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:37,040
you would like to say you know this is

2721
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,400
sort of like you know the

2722
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,679
uh somehow phrases settled here

2723
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:43,520
like this bluetooth parts i'm interested

2724
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,199
into what you're going to add there

2725
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:46,880
but then yeah since it has been there

2726
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,040
for a while uh what's the latest

2727
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,840
[Music]

2728
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,159
just i guess lack of time on the author

2729
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:55,119
so i have

2730
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:57,280
materials i have studied bluetooth mesh

2731
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,159
and our how the provisioning works there

2732
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:02,239
it's just finding the time to write it

2733
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,600
and i promise

2734
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,560
if this gets adopted in in the version

2735
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:06,960
that

2736
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,440
that is the research group version there

2737
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,520
will be text on on bluetooth

2738
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:13,920
as well

2739
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:19,839
okay good

2740
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:24,639
okay so i take it aaron that you would

2741
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:26,400
be able to provide comments on the

2742
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:29,199
bluetooth section

2743
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,480
uh when there is content i can provide

2744
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,239
the current one has three lines or four

2745
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:34,639
lines

2746
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:37,840
so yeah we weren't texting this to be

2747
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,239
done

2748
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:42,799
so uh i promise to add add that

2749
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:46,719
great card go ahead

2750
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:49,119
yeah if there are no other questions let

2751
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:51,199
me do my usual poll thing

2752
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:55,440
so again are you interested in providing

2753
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,719
comments

2754
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:01,840
on this draft

2755
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:11,199
oh nobody is not raising their hand

2756
01:49:11,199 --> 01:49:13,040
interested in providing comments as in

2757
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,199
aligning our standards with it

2758
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:17,119
we've been struggling with defining you

2759
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,560
know life cycle and this

2760
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,320
provisioning onboarding bootstrapping

2761
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:24,239
these terms and definitions of them

2762
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:25,599
so we'll look at it from that point of

2763
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:28,000
view of at least a buying terminology so

2764
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,440
the question is how stable is that

2765
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,560
section of the document

2766
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,639
like if we align and you change it it'll

2767
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:34,320
be kind of a nuisance

2768
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,559
so

2769
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,440
so what what's your view on the

2770
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,679
stability of that part

2771
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,679
i think the the

2772
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:50,080
summary of the different sdos is stable

2773
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,239
unless the spos go and change their

2774
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:53,119
specs

2775
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:56,320
obviously the takeaways is is something

2776
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,080
that is currently the author's

2777
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,440
reflection of

2778
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:02,000
of understanding that that generally

2779
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,119
there is this

2780
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:04,800
bootstrapping phase which is then

2781
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,159
followed by provisioning and

2782
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:07,520
configuration

2783
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,840
but once this get gets working group

2784
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,000
adopted then it's the working group

2785
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,320
our research groups understanding of of

2786
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,400
what are the key lessons or takeaways

2787
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,159
but

2788
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,599
i feel that part is stable and please

2789
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:25,840
find time to read and provide comments

2790
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:33,760
okay so the the result of the poll was

2791
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:35,199
that there are eight people

2792
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,679
who are interested in providing comments

2793
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:39,040
on this document so

2794
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,960
that's a significant level of

2795
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,080
interest so i'm not going to start

2796
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:46,719
another

2797
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:49,760
poll but just to get a sense of the room

2798
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,880
um if if you are opposed

2799
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:56,320
to the idea that the research group

2800
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:59,440
could be adopting this document

2801
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:07,839
please speak up now

2802
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:13,360
so as usual we are going to put an

2803
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,920
adoption call out in the

2804
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,239
mailing list but that's at least useful

2805
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:21,520
level of interest and

2806
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,480
nobody is opposed so i think we have

2807
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:25,760
good chances to

2808
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,760
to complete this affirmatively

2809
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,880
all right

2810
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:36,169
[Music]

2811
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:40,239
any more comments for mohit

2812
01:51:40,239 --> 01:51:42,638
right now

2813
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:50,880
dan says adopt thank you then

2814
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,719
well all right thank you for your time

2815
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,960
i look forward to your comments on the

2816
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:03,840
mailing list

2817
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,520
thank you so we have

2818
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:12,480
eight minutes left and

2819
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:16,000
it's time for a wrap up any other things

2820
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:31,840
that people want to bring up

2821
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,159
so this should be the point where the

2822
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:36,159
the chairs point to all the wonderful

2823
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:38,159
things that we will be doing

2824
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:41,040
uh in in the next time and much of this

2825
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,400
actually depends on

2826
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:45,679
on getting feedback from the research

2827
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:46,719
group so

2828
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:50,159
we have seen three drafts actually could

2829
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:51,920
use feedback

2830
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:54,800
at the moment please please go ahead

2831
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:55,760
short notes

2832
01:52:55,760 --> 01:53:00,880
are useful longer notes are also useful

2833
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,719
and yeah and we will have

2834
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:07,920
our regular wishy calls

2835
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,599
again soon anything else i should

2836
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,520
be mentioning ari

2837
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,719
i guess that's a good good overview of

2838
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:22,880
the upcoming activities and

2839
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:25,360
as usual follow the things in rg mailing

2840
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,520
list we'll be posting their information

2841
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:30,639
if their new active is coming and as

2842
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:33,199
always we're always looking forward for

2843
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:34,080
more

2844
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:36,960
