1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,960
okay

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:30,640
yeah one of those

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
maybe unselect the one the two that you

4
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,519
have selected

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
yes and now unselect the other one as

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,840
well this one you just like newly opened

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,399
basically

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,399
i think the the menu where you have been

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,000
i'm just guessing because i can't read

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,640
it

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,239
the menu where you've been there was

12
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,239
another another one ticked so if you

13
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,000
untick that one

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,600
the lower one f9

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,679
i guess i don't know

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
so the language you should okay

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,400
so i kind of show the slogan okay yeah

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
full screen is a better for this oh you

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,560
can maybe just like actually probably

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,400
can take the sidebar and you just like

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,920
take the line and just move it to the

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,880
left no

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,960
just kidding okay i don't know i can't

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,799
actually start very soon

27
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,840

so this is the ietf note well so this

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
is the remainder of the itr policies

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,160
so that you are maybe familiar with this

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
the ietf note well

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
i hope that you can go through this the

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,160
noteworld

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,200
very quickly and to understand the

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,160
ideal policies okay

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,040
okay next we have a small introduction

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
about this the ib

48
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,760
open meeting so that's in fact this is

49
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,480
the third ib open meeting

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,840
so this meeting is a

51
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,280
ib organized session focus on the

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
technical and

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
architectural topics so this

54
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
objective is to increase the visibility

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,519
of the ib

56
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,200
work and also to collect feedback

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
and community input about ongoing and

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,840
the new ib

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
work so besides this

60
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,879
the ib of a meeting we have the several

61
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
days the main list

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,280
so including this the architecture

63
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,920
discuss

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
main list for the architectural

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,440
discussion

66
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,560
and the ib documents

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,920
and ib at ib.org

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
for comments and concerns directly to

69
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,239
the ib

70
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,360
and we also have this the program mainly

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,159
list

72
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,720
for direct comments on work of a

73
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,840
specific

74
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,439
program so this is the ibu

75
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,319
ib open meeting and the corresponding

76
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,519
main list

77
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,760
for the specific ib work

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
so this is the agenda for this ib open

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
meeting

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
so this including the topic

81
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,639
first is the welcome and the stage

82
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,918
updates

83
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,680
and then this is the tommy will

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
introduce the edm program

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,919
so then this is the open macro phone

86
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,880
so this is the agenda do you have any

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,280
this

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,639
the uh my idea to bash the agenda

89
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,400
yeah i mean actually i want like i would

90
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
like to add something so if you look at

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,520
the meeting material

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
there's an additional presentation there

93
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
where we where yari actually

94
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
summarized nicely um some of the

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,360
previous discussions around

96
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,199
centralization and previous work that

97
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,199
happened around centralization

98
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
um so that is something that he curated

99
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
based on the discussion we had yesterday

100
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,600
in the in the plenary so after tommy's

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,360
talk we will take his slides go quickly

102
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,320
through that and then

103
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,280
start a discussion there

104
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
okay so we will add this the

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,880
topic about the centralization from the

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,880
yari okay any other

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,280
idea for the batch agenda

108
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,680
okay so then we will go to the next

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
okay uh mira that's your turn

110
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,880
to introduce the updates of the ib

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,560
documents and the programs okay mirror

112
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,440
okay thank you um yeah so as usually we

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
try to update you a little bit on the

114
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
technical work we're doing

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
um so since the last meeting we

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,960
published one rfc

117
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
um this one has been around for a while

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,000
but it's finally published

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
and has an rfc number and that's a

120
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,919
report for the data workshop

121
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,680
um but the more interesting news is that

122
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
we also have now a draft for the

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,759
kovit 19 workshop which is workshop that

124
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
happened last november

125
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,639
um so that's kind of reasonably new um

126
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,479
but it's already in very good shape

127
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,720
we got a bunch of video comments already

128
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
um it's a

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
research it's a workshop report which

130
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
means like i don't think i hope there's

131
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,280
not like a huge amount of discussion

132
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,039
about what needs to be in the document

133
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,639
it's really trying just to report what's

134
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,800
happening um i have the feeling that

135
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,360
this is

136
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
kind of ready so we will soon decide to

137
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,759
go for a final community feedback on

138
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,720
this draft

139
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
and then hopefully publish it very soon

140
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,319
src so

141
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,840
if you haven't read this yet and you

142
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
want to read it it's a good time now but

143
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,120
we will also send out an official

144
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,479
community call

145
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,039
um yeah so yeah that's only workshop

146
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,400
reports this time the

147
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
um we might come up with new documents

148
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,400
soon

149
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
let's go to the next slide

150
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,160
yeah then um program updates um

151
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,800
last time in the iab open meeting we

152
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
reported a little bit that we looked at

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,680
our programs

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,160
and we also considered um the structure

155
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,440
of the programs

156
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,319
a little bit and we discovered that we

157
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
have like two different kind of

158
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,840
programs one set of programs is really

159
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,080
focusing on technical work where we want

160
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,000
to engage with the community more

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
and then there's another set of program

162
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
which is usually a small focus groups of

163
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,560
experts

164
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
that help the iab to do their work to do

165
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,039
to work on their responsibilities

166
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,440
so that's why we introduced this

167
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,639
restructuring

168
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,280
of programs and since then we've been

169
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,039
working on also reviewing all the

170
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,639
programs we have to make sure

171
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,479
um they are fit for purpose basically

172
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,720
they serve they serve and support the

173
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
iab in the way they are

174
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
supposed to be and what we did is

175
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
we looked at two of the programs which

176
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
are more in the group of admin support

177
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,319
groups

178
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
um so not technical programs but i still

179
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
want to quickly mention this here

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
because that has been recent work even

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,440
so it's like not really

182
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,879
bringing the technical architectural

183
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,360
discussion for fashion forward

184
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,639
so we have the ayanna program

185
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,360
which will now become the ietf vienna

186
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,479
group

187
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,800
so the chatter of this program will be

188
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,919
updated

189
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,400
and what we do is we align a little bit

190
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
the activities and the communication we

191
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,199
have

192
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,000
uh we had with diana into this program

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,319
matching up with reality basically

194
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,680
you might have seen that there was

195
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,440
already a mail on this send out to the

196
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
architecture discuss list

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
so you had a chance to comment there you

198
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,800
can still comment but basically this is

199
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
ready and and

200
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
the iab is is ready to go ahead and make

201
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
this change

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,440
the other um support group or

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
previous program is the liaison

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,880
oversight program

205
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
and bib decided to close this program

206
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,839
and first of all we like to thank all

207
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
program members for their service

208
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
and this program has been dormant for

209
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
many years there was really no activity

210
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,760
and that's because this program wasn't

211
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,880
like even so the name

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,279
seems to suggest that wasn't um involved

213
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,120
in the actual oversight of the liaison

214
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,000
management

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
the program was very active in defining

216
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
how liaison management works in defining

217
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
processes

218
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
and providing advice but the kind of

219
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
day-to-day oversight work was like taken

220
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,880
up by the iab directly for a long time

221
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
and we are currently working on also

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,519
improving this liaison management

223
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
and that's what you will see on the next

224
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,519
slide

225
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,080
so this is what the iab is currently

226
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
doing we're in the process

227
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,240
of looking at our liaison management and

228
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,360
try to improve it

229
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
this is because we think it's really

230
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
important an important role

231
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
in the iub and we want to make sure it's

232
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,160
more clear

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,680
because there have been a lot of

234
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
confusions you know how who to contact

235
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
if you have a question like when to send

236
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
a lease or statement when to have a

237
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
lease on relationship

238
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,160
and so on so we really want to make this

239
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
process more clear and more transparent

240
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,160
and also improve the internal

241
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
communication and the view that the iab

242
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
has because sometimes it wasn't actually

243
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
easy to find out for the iab

244
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
itself you know where activities are

245
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
needed or not needed

246
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
another another point here is that we

247
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
also noticed

248
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,200
that we are at the point where we

249
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
actually have to work on knowledge

250
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
transfer

251
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,839
it is happening that people do retire

252
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,519
and we have to make sure

253
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,200
that we transfer this knowledge and that

254
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,920
we keep continuity of this knowledge

255
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,480
um for a bunch of experts in different

256
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
regions of the iab

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,839
itf um and

258
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
it's not enough to just like you know

259
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,640
have their email address put them on a

260
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,240
mailing list or whatever because

261
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
those people might actually go away at

262
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,440
some point so we have to be more active

263
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,560
here

264
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,200
so the one one thing that the ib already

265
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,279
did in this respect was we created a new

266
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,120
position within the iab which we call

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,160
the liaison coordinator position

268
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
so this position has the goal to be

269
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
really one clear contact point

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
for the lease on managers as well as for

271
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,440
the community

272
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,959
and therefore we have established an

273
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,360
email alias that you can use to send us

274
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,519
questions about liaisons

275
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,040
or lease on statement of course you can

276
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
still contact the news managers you can

277
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,000
still contact the ib

278
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
directly but also this email alias is

279
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,440
really for any

280
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,519
um laser related question a good first

281
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,120
contact point if you don't know who to

282
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,839
ask

283
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,480
otherwise so this new position basically

284
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,399
replaces the current shepard structure

285
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
that we have the current structure was a

286
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:30,959
one-to-one

287
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,040
um structure where we had like one iab

288
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,279
shepard for each liaison manager

289
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,279
the liaison managers are stable

290
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,040
positions because that's where the

291
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,160
knowledge is about

292
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
the other sdo about like how to interact

293
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,279
with them

294
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,200
but then we had like a second person on

295
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
the iab who would be like the shepherd

296
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
and the contact point

297
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,639
and that was just like confusing because

298
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
we changed them on a yearly basis and it

299
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,120
was like

300
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
many different people was hard to find

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
and so on so like concentrating this on

302
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
like one

303
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,600
position which probably will be filled

304
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
by two people to have a backup

305
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,440
um should like make things more clear

306
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,279
and easier hopefully

307
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,440
but we're also still in the pro process

308
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,279
to define this position a little bit

309
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
more to figure out if there are further

310
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
tasks that these um

311
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,399
people that fill the position can take

312
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,480
on and we will provide you further

313
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,839
information hopefully very soon by email

314
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,440
but that's only really just the first

315
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
step there is more what we want to do

316
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
uh and because this is an important

317
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
topic and we also want to involve

318
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
community experts and resource managers

319
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
to get feedback from them to understand

320
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,399
what needs to be done where improvements

321
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,480
are needed um

322
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,680
and i'm bringing this up here uh as part

323
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,160
of the

324
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,079
iboga meeting even so this is not on the

325
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,760
technical side it's really more

326
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,720
um internal admin administrator but

327
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,880
still i think this is a good opportunity

328
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,959
to get you all the information as a

329
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,240
community that you need

330
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
especially that we now have this new

331
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,160
role but also to have a discussion

332
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,680
uh and have a forum for that and with

333
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,160
that i will make a pause

334
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
um i wasn't able to read the whole chat

335
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,760
but i will review it at some point but i

336
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,440
will give the people a community to

337
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,480
enter the queue and

338
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:21,839
comment if they want

339
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,920
so if you don't mind maria and robin

340
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,200
this is nice change

341
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,440
is it public somewhere beside this slide

342
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
um it's in the iab report again about

343
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,120
the liaison coordinator i will also

344
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,079
provide more detailed information soon

345
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,480
and

346
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,199
we are about to update the webpage i

347
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,560
thought we already did but maybe we

348
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,519
didn't

349
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,839
so it's like it's all fresh news and it

350
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,839
will all happen very soon

351
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,839
okay thank you

352
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,160
i i just wanted to say that um

353
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,839
that i think this is definitely a step

354
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,279
in the right direction the

355
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,000
uh the situation last several years in

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,880
which there was

357
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,839
uh so much silence that if liaison

358
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,120
managers

359
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,040
needed help they couldn't figure out a

360
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,240
to was uh

361
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,920
was definitely a bad situation we're all

362
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
concerned and uh

363
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
and i really appreciate that the iab is

364
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,320
uh is taking this seriously again

365
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
and uh and moving in some direction

366
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,519
which is

367
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
uh uh will keep both the liaison

368
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,800
managers and the ia be a little bit more

369
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,639
uh informed of what each other are doing

370
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,199
and coordinated so thank you

371
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,120
definitely that's the goal here i i got

372
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,560
a bunch of emails over the last year

373
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
where people just didn't know who to ask

374
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
um but it's also that like we have the

375
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,399
iap want to have um

376
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,399
a better view about what's happening and

377
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,920
to answer uh martin's

378
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,880
question from the chat so um this is not

379
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,560
an email list this is an alias that's

380
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
really just forwarded to the person who

381
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,639
are serving in this position

382
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,720
um and this this per the person who's

383
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,320
serving in this position is usually the

384
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,800
one

385
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
who can hopefully like some of the easy

386
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
questions just answer them directly if

387
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,079
it's more about you know process but in

388
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:22,800
other cases

389
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
it's also just like part of the role to

390
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
just forward those

391
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
questions to the right people hopefully

392
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
so if it's for you it will be forwarded

393
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,759
to you

394
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,320
if you're a liaison manager um but we

395
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,880
also

396
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,120
want to add a function to the data

397
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,639
tracker that we can actually reach

398
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
easily all the leads or managers and

399
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,759
create a list for that because that also

400
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,040
doesn't exist right now

401
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
so many small things that we are looking

402
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:55,839
at at the moment

403
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,680
uh wait sorry i'm not looking at the

404
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
cube so child

405
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,160
you're also in the queue

406
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,440
uh yeah hi um so um

407
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
one of the things i've been spending a

408
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,720
lot of time on and

409
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,199
especially recently is open source and

410
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,199
it's relation to standards

411
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,000
and um you know there's a really nice uh

412
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,120
ongoing

413
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,399
set of sessions that uh open forum urine

414
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
open forum europe's putting on and

415
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,720
alyssa spoke there

416
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,040
um i also work closely with the linux

417
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,320
foundation

418
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,920
uh and i think they're they're talking

419
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,959
today i i think in general we need uh

420
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,560
i don't know if the liaison's the right

421
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
thing but uh

422
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,000
it doesn't work we have any liaison with

423
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,680
linux foundation or with other open

424
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,079
source

425
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,560
organizations and it's it's interesting

426
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
i think it's a bit of a problematic

427
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,959
when i've looked into it before the

428
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,480
what's come back is well you know we

429
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,759
don't have a problem

430
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,680
with uh open source uh organizations and

431
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,000
the liaisons usually like

432
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,519
you know when we're when we're dealing

433
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,599
with problems but it just seems like a

434
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,480
liaisons

435
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,880
uh handy thing so that we you know we

436
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,919
pop up on their

437
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,480
slides even as an organization that that

438
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
they're working with and that we have a

439
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,319
little bit more communication as

440
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,839
these worlds of open source and

441
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,559
standards continue to uh

442
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,039
um you know have more and more impact on

443
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,520
each other i'd say

444
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,559
yeah so this is two points here one is

445
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,840
um um can you mute because echo

446
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,919
thanks so uh one point is that like

447
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,120
those cases where we

448
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,200
kind of had to establish a nissan

449
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
relationship it's often because the

450
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,919
other organization

451
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,840
requires us to have like this kind of

452
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,960
formal relationship

453
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
to you know um get into the meetings

454
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,039
access their documents or whatever

455
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,400
and that's the case where we really need

456
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,320
the formula you saw in other cases it's

457
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
sufficient if like or it's usually

458
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
like just having the formal you saw

459
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
doesn't help that actually anything

460
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,480
would change so it really

461
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,080
is the people that have to go there and

462
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,440
work together and talk to each other

463
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
right and that doesn't require a formal

464
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,600
lisa

465
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,760
but the other point really is here also

466
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,679
to figure out where we need to go and

467
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,600
who we need to talk to and so on and i

468
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
see that actually independent of like

469
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
the strict police or management itself

470
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,799
it's really about outreach it's really

471
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,520
about figuring out what other stos and

472
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
organizations are doing

473
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
make sure we are well aligned with them

474
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,720
and that's definitely a big field where

475
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,160
we need to do more work and i have this

476
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,679
on my list of to do's but i

477
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,039
to this put this a little bit in a

478
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,559
different bucket and it's definitely

479
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,080
something i want to drive forward and

480
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
discuss but it's also less

481
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,400
straightforward

482
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,640
because it's and you know it's sometimes

483
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,320
people go to other organizations and

484
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,160
they give a presentation at a conference

485
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,840
and whatever and that's always very

486
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,640
positive

487
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,400
but like we don't have a task force we

488
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
don't have like a way to send people

489
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,799
somewhere

490
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,799
it's really kind of on like if they are

491
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,160
there if they have the possibility they

492
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,120
can do it

493
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,799
and but even for those occasions i think

494
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,160
we need better coordination and have a

495
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,720
better

496
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,400
visibility what's happening and who's

497
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,320
going where and telling what

498
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,039
so yeah i think that's more discussion

499
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
is needed

500
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,200
did that very great thanks and sort of

501
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
your take on is how i feel too it's like

502
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,960
you know the people who are involved

503
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,320
everything's going well there's not a

504
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,600
problem there we're able to work with

505
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,320
open source

506
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,400
organizations very well it's just sort

507
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,360
of from uh

508
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
an optics point of view it almost looks

509
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,720
like we're not because we don't have

510
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,600
that liaison

511
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,720
and so i think and for some people who

512
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,200
are looking

513
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
to get more involved in this or don't

514
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
know what's already going on i think

515
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
it'd be very helpful as well

516
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,919
so okay that's a really good point so

517
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,200
maybe we should figure out how to make

518
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,120
this more visible on our web page and

519
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,160
wherever

520
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,039
yep yep if i can add to that really

521
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,120
quickly i think um

522
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,919
[Music]

523
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,919
there's a lot of we the the important

524
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,919
thing to take into account is that all

525
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,600
technical you know discussions and stuff

526
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,039
should happen as

527
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,559
regardless of whether there's a liaison

528
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,480
ship and regardless of anything else

529
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:50,960
right

530
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,400
there's nothing stopping etf

531
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,080
participants to engage

532
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,039
in multiple other communities um the iab

533
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,640
would definitely like to hear

534
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
of places where that's not working right

535
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,840
where

536
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,520
where is a more formal relationship as

537
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,039
maria's you know suggested

538
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,880
is actually necessary or where do we

539
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,159
actually need to

540
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,360
send sort of more official

541
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,919
correspondence um but

542
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,600
and i think you know we would love

543
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,919
feedback for what is working and what is

544
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
not working so that we can figure out

545
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
how to better you know update the

546
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,240
liaison management

547
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
roles in the first place and which ones

548
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
are working well which ones are not

549
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,400
um but don't let you know any of this

550
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
program stop

551
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
people from you know working in multiple

552
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
organizations and bringing work both

553
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,840
directions and correspondence both

554
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,679
directions

555
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,760
and i mean this is still not like a

556
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,840
structural approach but like if you have

557
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,360
information that you think is like about

558
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
another seo but another organization

559
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
that you think is important like

560
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,240
please send an email to the ib we are

561
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,000
always open for that and we're always

562
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,440
able or like keen to learn something um

563
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
so i think we have more people on the

564
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,918
queue and bob

565
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,000
last year i got involved with ansi

566
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,360
on unmanned aircraft systems standards

567
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,039
works they're collecting who's doing

568
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,159
what

569
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,640
and i basically have to represent the

570
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,919
ietf

571
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,080
and what we are doing in our standards

572
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
which impact

573
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,200
uas uh i did reach out to try to get any

574
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
lays under other official

575
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
um contacts i got only minimal support

576
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,360
on that

577
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,039
i think the final document coming out of

578
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,200
antsy was reasonably well

579
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,559
in including ietf as an sdo

580
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,520
involved in uh unmanned aircraft systems

581
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,320
they

582
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,280
ansi then spill spooled up an effort on

583
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,440
satellite communication

584
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
and i just did not have the bandwidth or

585
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
anything else to

586
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
reach out to people to say hey ansi is

587
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
doing this satellite thing

588
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,320
and they've just published that document

589
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,919
and itf is really not

590
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
mentioned at all in terms of satellite

591
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,000
communications

592
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,200
so just kind of saying that my

593
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,320
experience

594
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,159
has been a little bit on a struggle side

595
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,679
particularly now i'm dealing more and

596
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,760
more in

597
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,799
more shall we say closed sdos like in

598
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,559
aviation iko

599
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,600
um and working with astm

600
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
where um they have some very

601
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,720
formal rules for liaisoning and it's uh

602
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,960
i'm just participating there as a

603
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,520
technical expert

604
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,240
but it's having more eye tip backing

605
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,039
may be of real value particularly if you

606
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,840
see

607
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,480
um what's i've managed to get into the

608
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,400
the private network proposal for

609
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,720
aviation they call grain

610
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,039
and uh some of the uh they do have

611
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,159
ik does have a liaison with icann

612
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,120
but that's uh different in intent so i'm

613
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,559
just kind of uh

614
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,919
sharing with you that there is a um

615
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,280
other areas that we maybe would do

616
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,679
better

617
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,679
and i don't know if it should be i

618
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,720
should be doing more

619
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,159
or how to proceed on this yeah i mean i

620
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:10,799
understand

621
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,320
i understand the point when you say you

622
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,919
you would appreciate more backing from

623
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,240
the

624
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
ietf but on the other hand it wouldn't

625
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
change the situation that we still need

626
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,360
somebody like you who actually

627
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,559
participates in in

628
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,640
this organization and goes there and has

629
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,679
the time and the

630
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,440
bandwidth to actually contribute uh

631
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
where needed

632
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,400
and that's not necessarily always the

633
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,919
requirement we have for all these law

634
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,440
managers it's really more like kind of

635
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,760
conflict handling when it comes up right

636
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,840
um so that's a much stronger commitment

637
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
uh that can may i ask you like who did

638
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,240
you reach out to when you did this

639
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,559
last year um i'll have to look at the

640
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,279
emails

641
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,480
and see uh um it may be

642
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
maybe lisa uh when i was doing with the

643
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,919
the ansi uh standards work um we did get

644
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:56,240
an

645
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,919
a more or less an official right wording

646
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,960
of uh that pulled together for what the

647
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,520
ietf is as an sdo

648
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,320
which they uh they wanted you know

649
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,279
officially

650
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,000
how do you define yourself as an sdo and

651
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,200
i and i

652
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,279
what did get pulled some wording

653
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,679
together to do that

654
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,480
and i'll afford you what i have on that

655
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,559
so you can see it

656
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,600
they were great thanks and then

657
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,279
we have braun i think uh

658
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,000
okay because of the reason of the time i

659
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,320
think

660
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,120
we have to cut the line i think the

661
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
semen is the last

662
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,080
one okay cool thanks

663
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,159
i was just going to say i'm i've kind of

664
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,200
wound up in an

665
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,279
unofficial liaison position a couple of

666
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,039
places have been invited as a technical

667
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,760
expert

668
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,360
to tc39s date time work that that we

669
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
talked about in dispatch early this week

670
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,159
and also

671
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,039
at the cal connect side i am i'm kind of

672
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,799
unofficially at least the liaison to

673
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,559
iatf because i'm a chair on the

674
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,039
calendaring group over here as well

675
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,039
is this something that that i mean i'm

676
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,080
sure there are plenty of other people

677
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
who are in similar positions

678
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,600
does this need to be officially tracked

679
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,039
or do we care if there's kind of

680
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,840
unofficial liaison stuff happening as

681
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
well

682
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,480
so it is there's no requirement to track

683
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
that uh i think it's it's

684
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,679
again generally a good thing if people

685
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,240
keep an eye out and and promote itf work

686
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,840
in other organizations

687
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,760
um i mean it's but i mean like you're

688
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,360
also not making any official

689
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,240
statements for the iatf in your position

690
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,679
right like you're if you're contributing

691
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,520
on a technical matter and you say

692
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,679
hey guys watch out there's some work in

693
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,360
the ietf that you should be aware of

694
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,200
that's that's always a good thing

695
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
if you if you need some backing if you

696
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,799
want some support if you have a problem

697
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,640
that's really the point where you're

698
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
very welcome to reach out to the iab

699
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,559
uh or in general like we are always

700
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,000
interesting to learn what's going on

701
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,720
right

702
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
um and as i said like we we don't have a

703
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,799
good track record yet so it would be

704
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,559
helpful to to learn more but we also

705
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
don't really know how to organize that

706
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,559
in

707
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,279
an efficient way at this point all right

708
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,640
sounds good i will i will

709
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
write something up at some point not

710
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,840
right now thank you

711
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,559
yeah so martin let me just reply to that

712
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,400
one quickly martin mentioned that people

713
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,200
might

714
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,200
misrepresent work of the idf um

715
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,799
so that happens as well but like that

716
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,080
will always happen that's something we

717
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,520
don't have a control

718
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,559
of um the it's as i said like it's i

719
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,159
think there's a very

720
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,799
in very few cases the the need to talk

721
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,400
as the ietf

722
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,799
it's some sdo is required to have like

723
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,480
this official representations

724
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
but in a lot of cases i hope that we can

725
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,559
actually work together and do good

726
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,320
technical work by concentrating on the

727
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,600
technical matters

728
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,279
and and that's what what we all want

729
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,120
um yeah seaman

730
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,760
thank you um i'm i'm simon hickson

731
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,559
from i would note that i'm from vice

732
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,960
chair of the etsy board so i'm making an

733
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,240
observation from that perspective

734
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,760
although i'm not speaking officially on

735
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,559
behalf

736
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,720
on behalf of etsy i'm actually am from a

737
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,600
uk government

738
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,799
government employee um it

739
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,039
it's it works quite awkwardly in the

740
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,039
reverse direction as well when as etsy

741
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,720
we want to talk to our etf

742
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
it's very difficult to work out who to

743
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,159
talk to

744
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,320
unless we happen to have individuals who

745
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,919
are taking part in

746
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,919
in particular firm ietf from groups

747
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,120
within the room and i think that's where

748
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,200
something like etsy with quite a strong

749
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,720
central secretariat

750
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,480
struggles against some something like

751
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,200
ietf with quite a small secretariat

752
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,279
um so i i i don't really see any answer

753
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,559
the problem apart from sort of

754
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,320
could we strengthen the secretariat in

755
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,080
some way to do this which i appreciate

756
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
is a cost issue etc etc

757
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
and is there and is and is there and is

758
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,159
there and is therefore not easy

759
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,039
but i think sort of ietf would would

760
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,200
benefit in the overall

761
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,480
um sdo ecosystem

762
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,720
if there if there was some sort of

763
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,399
central contact point

764
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,399
that could do some of this interfacing

765
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,080
and again i appreciate that's not a role

766
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,640
that the

767
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,039
the secretary of united curry takes is

768
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:21,919
very much more of

769
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,000
an organizational thing but i think you

770
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,840
know as we as we get a more

771
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
integrated global system you know

772
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
something like 6g demands that

773
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
standards interface all over the place

774
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,720
in ways in which they haven't done

775
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,600
before you know

776
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,720
we're going to need more sdo contact and

777
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,159
you know if if we can't get the sdo

778
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,480
ecosystem talking to each other better

779
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
and understanding each other better

780
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,760
um then we are going to

781
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,919
become more and more awkward and um

782
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,240
which i think will just fragment our the

783
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,919
overall seo system even

784
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,120
even even even more badly than arguably

785
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,720
at the moment you know and sort of how

786
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
do how do we do standards

787
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
etc etc so the the official point here

788
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,799
contact point here is the iab and i hope

789
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,240
having a separate uh

790
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,159
email alias here that is like more clear

791
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,679
to that it helps a little bit

792
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,360
and we will put the information on the

793
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,200
website in the right places hopefully

794
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,880
um even so the website might also not be

795
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
super clear and easy to find

796
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,919
um so i'm not sure maybe it's just like

797
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,039
a missing information to other seos like

798
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,640
that the ib is the right

799
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,880
point to talk to but to be honest if you

800
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
if you you know if you

801
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
um use any of the other email addresses

802
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,679
that you find on our website most of

803
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,279
them go to the secretariat and they know

804
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,960
how to forward this to the iap

805
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,679
so um it shouldn't be that hard to reach

806
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,760
us it's probably just like unclear

807
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,399
how to do it

808
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,760
okay do you think this like um

809
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,679
a siemens already gone right do you

810
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,440
think this like email address will help

811
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,760
or

812
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
is there more kind of advertisement

813
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,240
needed

814
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,640
i would i would just an email address

815
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,399
would do does help

816
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,240
but it's actually being able to engage

817
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
in a two-way conversation with a person

818
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
who understands your system and can be a

819
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,640
central contact point of system

820
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,559
and in a way in which sdos with a larger

821
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,559
secretariat can and do

822
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,159
you know i appreciate their they're

823
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,919
probably rather more formal than what

824
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,679
than we are in iatf you know but i think

825
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,360
you know as we get this

826
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
greater level of interfacing that i

827
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
think we need in in technology as a

828
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,760
whole

829
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,799
you know um i think all sdos have to

830
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,080
have to move with the times and then

831
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,480
we've

832
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,640
we've seen more and more sort of central

833
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
coordination iitf as the years have gone

834
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,679
by

835
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,039
and um i think as we move forward um

836
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,039
we we need a greater degree of central

837
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,240
coordination here

838
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,600
in the sense of people you can actually

839
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
engage in a conversation with

840
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,640
rather than just a a mailbox you can

841
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,279
i mean you can send an email to okay

842
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,159
understood

843
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,200
i think that's a yeah probably a

844
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,640
slightly separate problem because we do

845
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,159
have for example leadership meetings

846
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,440
with other sdo slides

847
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,840
like i triple e and so on um so that's

848
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,279
probably more in this category but it's

849
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:05,919
yeah

850
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,799
good input thank you

851
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,360
okay so next topic

852
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,960
is the edm uh for the latest progress

853
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,279
from the tommy okay let's share

854
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,600
okay

855
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,240
okay all right

856
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,000
slides up okay thank you

857
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
okay hello everyone um i'll be giving a

858
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,159
quick update on one of our technical

859
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:42,880
programs

860
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,200
which is one of the newer ones we have

861
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,159
um

862
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,799
this is the program that's on talking

863
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,320
about evolvability protocols

864
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
deployability and maintainability

865
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,919
um and in a lot of ways it's carrying on

866
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,360
work that ib had done in the past um

867
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,799
but trying to build on that

868
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,240
and find ways that we can come to more

869
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,480
technical recommendations to the ietf

870
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,760
for how we

871
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,960
ensure that the protocols we're

872
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,720
developing um have good properties

873
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,519
around these

874
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,720
aspects um and one administrative change

875
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,679
here is that

876
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,720
uh david schnauzy is now going to be a

877
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
co-lead of this program so hopefully

878
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,279
that will

879
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,320
allow us to have still better output and

880
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:28,640
uh

881
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
more energy in this so david do you want

882
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,960
to introduce yourself

883
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,600
absolutely so hi everyone i'm david

884
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,559
kanazi and i'm

885
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,480
very excited to be working on electronic

886
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,399
dance music here with the iab

887
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,840
back to you tommy

888
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,600
i love it all right next slide please

889
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,440
um so just some details here

890
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,679
we do have a github where um you can see

891
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,159
some of the issues we're thinking about

892
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,360
it's at that link and the document that

893
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,960
we're currently talking most about is

894
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,679
actually one that

895
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,720
existed prior to this program being

896
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,360
created

897
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,679
but we think is a very important work

898
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,360
item that we want to progress that

899
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,720
martin thompson

900
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,320
began it's the draft use it or lose it

901
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,880
and we've met now twice we had our last

902
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,840
call in december

903
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,000
and we're going to plan a new call for

904
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,840
some time in april

905
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,080
right now so far we've gone on a cadence

906
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,880
of

907
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,519
you know roughly as often as the iatf

908
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,399
meetings

909
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,559
but just slightly delayed next slide

910
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,879
please

911
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,880
so at the last meeting one of the major

912
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,480
topics we covered was

913
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,880
just looking at what are the mechanisms

914
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,360
that we're doing for protocol extensions

915
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,799
and are there things that

916
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,240
we could add um as notes to the user we

917
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,480
lose it draft and one of the topics here

918
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,120
was

919
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,840
looking at the relative success and um

920
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,360
how ossified we see things

921
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,640
when we're using something that's a

922
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
proper version negotiation versus just

923
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,159
extending a protocol

924
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,800
one of the observations in the document

925
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,480
is that you want to be able to

926
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,320
use an extension point

927
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,199
often and that is the best way to ensure

928
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,839
it does not ossify

929
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,918
but version negotiation specifically

930
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,280
is something that can get used very

931
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
infrequently

932
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,239
and especially is not being used when

933
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,520
you first deploy

934
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,239
a new protocol and so we were noting

935
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,040
that

936
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
actually some of the most successful

937
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,320
cases of this is when

938
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,520
a protocol has this version negotiation

939
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,239
in some other protocols extension point

940
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,280
for example

941
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,719
http using the alpn

942
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,480
which is just a tls extension which is a

943
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,320
very well

944
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,719
greased and well understood extension

945
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,560
point

946
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,520
um we also discussed some anti-patterns

947
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,880
like how we see

948
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,079
that the iip itself has a version

949
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
field that really is often not used and

950
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,119
you need to have

951
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,240
some encapsulating protocol like the

952
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,440
ether type

953
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,680
actually determine what is the protocol

954
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,640
version so we have

955
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,760
a lot of redundant um

956
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,880
version indicators in that case so we

957
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,320
have some initial

958
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,960
text that was added to the document

959
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
based on this but we're going to

960
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,680
continue to refine that and go further

961
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,480
next slide please

962
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
and there's also areas that we noted

963
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,560
that you know we are still

964
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,880
uh learning about there are ongoing

965
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,960
essentially experiments

966
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,440
particularly in what quick is doing and

967
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,200
the experience we're having in tls and

968
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
http

969
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,800
quick is one of the kind of first

970
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,240
protocols like this that's really

971
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,720
defining a strong notion of invariance

972
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
that will last across multiple versions

973
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,000
going to the future

974
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
we haven't deployed those other versions

975
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
yet so we're going to have to see how

976
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,190
that works out

977
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,640
[Music]

978
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,160
greasing is also something that's done a

979
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,680
lot already in tls

980
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
it's something that we can do in quick

981
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,000
and we're talking about doing

982
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,359
more in http and this is an area again

983
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,640
where

984
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,200
we'd like to have advice on this but

985
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
we're also still gathering information

986
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,040
and particularly one of the interesting

987
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,680
areas for greasing is

988
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,720
talking about how we can um coordinate

989
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,960
this um a lot of the discussion we had

990
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,560
indicates that

991
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,839
really the strength that we have from

992
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,880
trying to exercise code points is not

993
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,359
just in doing random things

994
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,880
um through completely random greasing

995
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,560
but really coordinating an effort

996
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,720
between different implementations

997
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,160
um so that's something that we want to

998
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,560
further explore in our next meeting

999
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,920
so if these are interesting topics to

1000
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,400
you please join in um anyone can join

1001
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,599
the list and anyone can join the

1002
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,040
meetings

1003
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,560
next slide i think that

1004
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,880
yep so here's the mailing list you can

1005
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,920
join

1006
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,400
um we'll be scheduling a call very soon

1007
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,040
and

1008
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,400
you can send your thoughts through email

1009
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,240
or github

elliot

1011
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,480
you are muted

1012
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,359
great permissions problem uh correction

1013
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:25,839
uh

1014
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,680
thanks for the opportunity to comment uh

1015
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,760
just one quick comment

1016
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,920
which is i think there's a difference in

1017
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,440
a qualitative difference between

1018
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,720
protocols

1019
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,760
and formats and so

1020
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,040
uh when you look at uh

1021
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,680
each right a protocol you can negotiate

1022
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,200
you can fail fast

1023
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
there are all sorts of things you can do

1024
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,839
in a protocol with

1025
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:52,640
a uh an object format you have

1026
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,079
less opportunity to fail and so

1027
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,440
you have to look at the problem a little

1028
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,079
differently um which is to say

1029
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,280
uh how do you handle backward

1030
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,359
compatibility and this has

1031
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,320
i think plagued uh some of the systems

1032
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,119
that we use

1033
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,359
pretty regularly like uh email and other

1034
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,320
things where

1035
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,920
you really don't want to have to have a

1036
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,680
backward compatibility but then you've

1037
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,320
got that

1038
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,560
one person who's using you know a

1039
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
teletype from you know

1040
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,240
or something they bought because they

1041
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,680
can't they can't see

1042
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,440
they bought it 10 15 years ago and

1043
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,880
they're not going to replace it

1044
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,119
so the there there are some aspects

1045
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,359
around those formats and as you're going

1046
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,160
through this

1047
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,560
exercise it might be worth just teasing

1048
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,480
out those differences

1049
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,000
that's a really good point yeah and i

1050
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,160
will add a note for that

1051
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,920
on our list of issues to look at thank

1052
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,040
you so much thank you

1053
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,160
okay i will seed the floor thank you

1054
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,359
everyone oh

1055
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,240
i guess we have stewart

1056
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,000
the just a data point really you said ip

1057
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
versions weren't used

1058
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,640
actually we use ipv versions to identify

1059
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,920
whether a packet is or

1060
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,359
isn't a an ip packet in the mpls domain

1061
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,920
and then actually sequester those fields

1062
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,480
for some

1063
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,599
other internal notations so it's

1064
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,839
not actually correct to pick that

1065
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,720
particular example

1066
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,480
yeah thank you for that note and i i

1067
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,440
think um the way i was explaining it was

1068
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,200
overly simplified and the text we're

1069
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,480
working on in the document should be

1070
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,280
hopefully uh

1071
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,200
a bit more nuanced of just pointing out

1072
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,960
that there are instances

1073
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,800
where that version field could not be

1074
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,560
fully leveraged not that it is never

1075
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,000
leveraged

1076
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,680
okay you just pick that one and it just

1077
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,280
happens to be used in another protocol

1078
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,359
that was my one of my favorites

1079
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,839
well perfect thank you

1080
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:57,839
all right thank you so much

1081
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,560
yeah i think we uh move on with um

1082
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,200
picking up the centralization discussion

1083
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,839
from yesterday basically

1084
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,960
thank you can you share the slides okay

1085
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,119
there we go excellent so um

1086
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,359
this is basically just as noted

1087
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:24,560
continuing the discussion

1088
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,599
from from yesterday and uh

1089
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,599
a little bit of context setting and

1090
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,440
pointers to existing work and

1091
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,319
a couple of thoughts about way forward

1092
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,119
or how this

1093
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,640
can be best discussed because the next

1094
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,118
slide please

1095
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,640
so the topics that i think we are

1096
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,839
discussing about

1097
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,560
is um two things really one is what we

1098
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:48,960
call

1099
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,839
centralized service deployment which is

1100
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,240
about

1101
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,480
basically providing services by a single

1102
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,359
entity

1103
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,440
rather than doing it in a collaborative

1104
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,720
fashion

1105
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,960
and when i say single entity i don't

1106
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,160
mean that you have

1107
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
one server you could be running a

1108
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,520
distributed worldwide

1109
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
network but it's still under the control

1110
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,839
of a single administrative domain

1111
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,040
a single company for instance

1112
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,520
and of course the internet is not either

1113
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,079
or

1114
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,160
there's a mixture of things inside the

1115
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,400
internet and some services are

1116
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,720
naturally under single control like you

1117
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,160
know my website or

1118
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,400
alternative dns server you know it's

1119
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,000
their information only one place can

1120
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,400
really

1121
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,040
really provide it other services could

1122
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,520
be

1123
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,440
such that they are fundamentally

1124
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,640
collaborative i think

1125
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,880
uh packet forwarding might be one

1126
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,319
example here so you have to

1127
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,280
forward to others essentially um and

1128
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,119
there's some service that could be

1129
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,160
um either way

1130
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,480
so that's that's sort of a technical

1131
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,880
thing in in some sense that we we are

1132
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,000
within one one domain or one

1133
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,079
administrative uh entity and then

1134
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,839
there's internet consolidation which is

1135
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,200
more about like

1136
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,800
competition and companies and so forth

1137
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,480
and how many

1138
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,200
service providers we have for particular

1139
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,160
things

1140
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,119
in the world and how much choice do you

1141
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,839
have as a consumer

1142
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,400
i think the iep heard yesterday has also

1143
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,359
heard before

1144
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,920
a clear message from you all the

1145
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,200
community

1146
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,040
that these topics are important

1147
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,560
centralization is important

1148
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,200
and we should also acknowledge that we

1149
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,440
realize that this is a complex topic

1150
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,240
we realize that it has many parts that

1151
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,560
are not technical

1152
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,319
and that there are difficult trade-offs

1153
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,560
and there's various viewpoints

1154
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,359
next slide please

1155
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,920
the question is does it um does it

1156
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,040
actually matter

1157
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,560
and should we be discussing it and um

1158
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,319
i at least personally think it matters i

1159
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,800
think other people were also saying that

1160
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,640
um so um it can have many impacts and

1161
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,079
and sort of important to realize that

1162
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,920
there can be in many directions so

1163
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,280
so first of all some of this can be good

1164
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,200
i think we've seen some technology

1165
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,640
adoption stories

1166
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,040
even with a recent ietf technologies

1167
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,240
where

1168
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,440
the dominance or the ease of large

1169
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,640
entities to switch on

1170
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,400
new technology has actually improved

1171
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,480
things quite a lot

1172
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,480
it's particularly easy if you control

1173
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,680
multiple parties

1174
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,960
in a protocol exchange it's also useful

1175
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,480
sometimes to hide in a crowd

1176
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,599
but there are also serious drawbacks one

1177
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,560
is of course

1178
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,040
resilience like if that one big service

1179
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,640
goes down and we've seen this kind of

1180
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,000
thing happen

1181
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,800
occasionally then we are in a world of

1182
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,839
hurt

1183
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,599
i think the right architectural response

1184
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,839
is to have

1185
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,640
not huge entities but more smaller

1186
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,720
entities collaborating

1187
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,720
it's also issues with the

1188
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,000
interoperability ability of new entrants

1189
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,079
to enter and so forth

1190
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,960
one sort of a personally concerning

1191
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,560
issue is also that

1192
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,920
if you have two large entities that have

1193
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,560
a lot of data let's say not just pick a

1194
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,520
random example

1195
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,240
entities that would know the browsing

1196
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,920
histories of people

1197
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,480
for large number of people that's very

1198
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,400
attractive target

1199
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,200
even if you are you know well-meaning

1200
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,400
you want to do like

1201
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,480
all of us i think in the itf everybody

1202
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,640
who's involved is doing this

1203
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
or any of these services and they are

1204
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,920
very good

1205
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,280
intentions but but they are also

1206
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,920
affected by governments and shareholders

1207
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,200
and so on that might be

1208
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,359
asking for for access to the data for

1209
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,400
instance

1210
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,079
so i think we want to avoid that in some

1211
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:44,000
ways there's of course

1212
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,520
economics involved i won't go into

1213
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,280
details of that you can read some of

1214
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,000
that when we

1215
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
move to the next slide uh so i was

1216
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,440
trying to

1217
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,240
collect a little bit of previously

1218
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,760
published material about this and of

1219
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,960
course

1220
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
at least for me it's it's surprising how

1221
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,319
good stuff you're going to find from the

1222
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,760
old rfcs

1223
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,880
um they were really written cleverly

1224
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,520
um rc1958 for instance talks about

1225
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,960
competitive multi-vendor

1226
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,720
multi-provider public networks 3935

1227
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,359
talks about decentralized control it's

1228
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:15,920
used

1229
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,400
user empowerment and so forth next slide

1230
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,920
please

1231
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,319
um i have a few other things here i

1232
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,599
won't go into

1233
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,240
the details of these these things uh

1234
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,640
save time for a discussion but

1235
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,240
i just wanted to point you the internet

1236
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,079
societies global report

1237
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,520
on consolidation and the journal of

1238
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,359
cyber policy and if you click

1239
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,800
one more slide forward so they

1240
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,920
actually published a special issue

1241
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,119
that was sponsored by isaac i don't see

1242
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,520
the next light yet but

1243
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,800
can you move to the next slide oh there

1244
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,680
we go

1245
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,040
um so they published a um an

1246
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,880
issue with consolidation related

1247
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,720
articles but uh

1248
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,440
various kinds of research or thoughts

1249
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,000
around

1250
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,119
this topic worth reading

1251
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,960
to take a look and maybe that's enough

1252
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,760
for

1253
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,800
for this past work the point was just to

1254
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,680
say that there's

1255
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,200
quite a lot of that's already been

1256
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,280
written about it if you go to the last

1257
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,560
slide

1258
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,839
where i had a few thoughts about

1259
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,440
how to move forward and i see

1260
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,200
many possibilities for failing to

1261
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,399
discuss this properly

1262
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,960
one is that i think we need to take it

1263
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,720
too hard that this is

1264
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,720
not just important but also this complex

1265
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,839
topic that you can't have like one-sided

1266
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:45,119
view into it um

1267
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,800
the other thing that we want to avoid is

1268
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,160
that we shouldn't

1269
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,240
trade take the debate to the extremes

1270
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,000
that just because we can't have like

1271
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,560
fully

1272
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,160
peer-to-peer network with you know

1273
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,640
bitcoin exchanged all over the place

1274
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,079
doesn't mean that we shouldn't do

1275
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,839
anything um

1276
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,520
and the same is true of also like not

1277
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,960
everything is going to be centralized

1278
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,720
doesn't mean that

1279
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,800
we shouldn't think about it's each case

1280
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,920
that we uh

1281
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,240
come across carefully and think about

1282
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,440
whether that's we're doing the right

1283
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,680
thing or the wrong thing

1284
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,400
um third point is that we should

1285
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,440
actually understand

1286
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,800
this this space and sometimes you get

1287
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,200
this

1288
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,839
frustration like i i get it that well i

1289
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,760
can't really do much so what what should

1290
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,000
i

1291
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,400
should i stop but i think it's actually

1292
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,480
useful to understand like

1293
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,079
understand the issues understand the

1294
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,520
impacts collect measurement data

1295
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,000
take actual you know stock of you know

1296
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,400
what's what's happening out there

1297
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,160
and and this information can be helpful

1298
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,839
for us but it's also obviously helpful

1299
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:44,240
for

1300
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,079
for the rest of the society who's also i

1301
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,359
think interested in

1302
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,960
some of the conclusions um

1303
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,040
and finally i i do think there are

1304
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,319
helpful things

1305
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,720
that we can do and if if the goal is

1306
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,280
to have like this magic solution that

1307
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:01,839
those all

1308
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,839
all of these problems and i i don't

1309
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,319
think we should be holding our breath

1310
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,680
but um i think there are

1311
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,880
things we could do one example uh is is

1312
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,240
that if you have something

1313
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,720
where you're only using one instance of

1314
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,280
something some technology for instance

1315
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,520
um and and that's too centralized or

1316
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,800
consolidated for

1317
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,839
for people's taste then having a way to

1318
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,200
discover other

1319
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,200
places that offer the same service can

1320
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,880
actually be useful i think we've done

1321
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,319
this in the dns space or

1322
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,880
are doing it at least so i think that's

1323
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,440
a

1324
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,520
helpful technique or example of a

1325
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,319
helpful technique

1326
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,760
um and i think that's it uh from my side

1327
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,000
i

1328
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,760
don't know if the other people from iab

1329
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,280
have been thinking about they want to

1330
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,520
provide their thoughts or or anybody

1331
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,000
else for that matter

1332
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,280
in the in the working group

1333
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,760
speak up

1334
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,960
yeah i i would like to add one point

1335
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,880
and that tommy made yesterday and

1336
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,559
probably he's much better in making his

1337
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,079
point herself um but i think it's also

1338
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,280
that like we can not necessarily push

1339
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,880
somebody to adopt a certain

1340
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,839
um technique just because they think we

1341
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:20,800
think it's like it's

1342
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,640
it's better for the internet i think

1343
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,839
deployment is always

1344
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:26,160
driven by uh you know what's the

1345
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,000
benefits that a solution provides

1346
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,960
uh what's the cheaper solution uh what's

1347
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,760
more easy

1348
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,119
easier to deploy solution and so on so

1349
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,240
with that um we probably have to keep in

1350
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,760
mind this when we design our

1351
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,359
protocols and also make sure that

1352
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,960
those solutions that we design and that

1353
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,960
we favor are the ones that can be easily

1354
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,720
adopted

1355
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,240
but i think tommy made this point

1356
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,920
somehow much better or maybe i'm

1357
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,000
misinterpreting him i don't know

1358
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,599
yeah thank you elliot i think you're

1359
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,760
next

1360
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,880
that i'm still having some permissions

1361
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,160
issues hey uh

1362
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,119
thanks yari uh this is good work and uh

1363
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,400
i think it's something that's been

1364
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:16,960
around

1365
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,359
everybody's um it's been in people's

1366
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,559
minds for a while

1367
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,599
um i wanna once again acknowledge

1368
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,440
uh even early comments that mark

1369
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,800
nottingham made

1370
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,839
uh on on this in an iab plenary going

1371
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:30,400
although

1372
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,800
going way back to 2014 or so

1373
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,839
um the two points i wanted to make is

1374
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,200
that uh first of all um

1375
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,640
i i do think there are

1376
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,520
times when we should be thinking about

1377
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,000
these

1378
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,040
aspects architecturally

1379
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,520
not and as they apply to our protocol

1380
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,240
suite

1381
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,440
perhaps one of the most egregious

1382
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,720
aspects of private networking

1383
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,400
is that it forces a form of

1384
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,760
concentration in that

1385
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,839
endpoints are all but prohibited

1386
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,440
from offering services without

1387
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,520
intermediaries this is something that

1388
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,800
um i raised early on as far back as 1994

1389
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,160
as a concern with with uh

1390
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,440
private network addresses so

1391
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,480
this is a problem that can recur and i

1392
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,079
think martin has written

1393
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,119
uh eloquently on the

1394
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,599
value and use and perhaps risks of

1395
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,240
intermediaries and that comes into this

1396
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,200
discussion

1397
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,400
uh the second point is uh

1398
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,760
that i wanted to agree with you about

1399
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,079
just how complex a problem this is one

1400
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:50,880
can easily

1401
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,960
argue that mail services these days

1402
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,359
are considerably more reliable than

1403
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,559
they've ever

1404
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,160
ever been because the there is not only

1405
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,160
a concentration of service providers but

1406
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,480
there's a concentration of expertise

1407
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,839
who then know how to scale these

1408
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,920
services which is really good

1409
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,200
the problem is when one of these

1410
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,520
providers fails the damage is

1411
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:14,720
considerable

1412
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,359
and we just saw a good example of that

1413
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,000
outside

1414
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,720
of the help mail environment over the

1415
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,839
last few days with

1416
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,960
one particular um uh

1417
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,880
offering where they they took out you

1418
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,960
know there was a risk that hit

1419
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,880
uh many thousands of businesses so

1420
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,280
it's very uh one of the things we should

1421
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,400
be thinking about

1422
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,240
in terms of resolving this by the way is

1423
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,920
can standards play a role

1424
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,240
can open standards uh or open guidance

1425
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,720
uh open up interfaces today that are in

1426
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,160
fact closed

1427
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,359
uh that might improve uh the the

1428
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,240
uh environment in terms of the risks of

1429
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,800
um

1430
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,359
resiliency that we face all right thanks

1431
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,680
very much

1432
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,559
uh say that we will close the queue very

1433
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,319
soon because we have now a huge

1434
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,520
number of people in the queue and only

1435
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,359
eight minutes seven minutes left so if

1436
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,800
you want to say something jump into the

1437
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,839
queue now and we'll be close in 10

1438
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:14,240
seconds

1439
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,959
pete you're next

1440
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,880
so purely questions um

1441
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,720
one thing and maybe i missed it at the

1442
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,079
top is

1443
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,480
where can folks get more involved in the

1444
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,839
discussion

1445
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:34,880
um and participate in this discussion

1446
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,599
because i think you know this is one of

1447
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:39,680
my things too i think a lot of people

1448
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,280
care about this one

1449
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,440
um and would like to figure out how to

1450
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,319
give input

1451
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,240
the other is um does the iab

1452
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,280
have any good levers to pull to

1453
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,720
to actually not just work against this

1454
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,200
but

1455
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,800
just deal with it whether it's work

1456
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,720
against it or say

1457
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,400
this is looking like it's centralizing

1458
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,079
and maybe it's good maybe it's bad

1459
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,200
and we have to examine and you know how

1460
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,960
might those levers affect

1461
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,839
ietf work how might they affect other

1462
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:10,319
work

1463
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,559
i'm just trying to get my head around

1464
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:13,760
how this is going to

1465
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,359
[Music]

1466
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,839
be useful discussion other than just

1467
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,599
shouting at clouds which some of us love

1468
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,680
to do anyway

1469
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,000
yeah i'm looking for my decentralized

1470
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,839
button but i can't find it right now

1471
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,559
i i think the only lever that we have is

1472
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:28,880
is

1473
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,240
information and educating people

1474
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,800
and with regards to where to discuss

1475
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,280
this

1476
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,040
i think yesterday somebody suggested

1477
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,720
that we should organize a workshop

1478
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,240
that's a possibility

1479
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,079
but we actually had workshops in this

1480
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,480
space and so that was in the slides

1481
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,599
um so i don't know if that's the right

1482
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,200
answer but definitely architecture

1483
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,720
discuss is one place where we can

1484
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,480
discuss this

1485
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,240
it would be nice to have something more

1486
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,799
ongoing than a workshop i mean i think

1487
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,280
workshops are great um and they always

1488
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,640
produce great output

1489
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,240
but this seems like such a big topic

1490
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,200
that having something more long-lived

1491
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,160
that the iab was running would be great

1492
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,119
okay

1493
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,319
we'll take that point on the

1494
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,880
consideration thank you

1495
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,359
andrew

1496
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,520
hi yeah uh well thank you for covering

1497
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,559
it uh uh

1498
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,880
again uh so briefly but but thoroughly

1499
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,079
uh yarry

1500
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,880
um i i i just would debate two points

1501
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,160
you touched on the fact there could be

1502
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,520
some benefits to

1503
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,240
uh users from uh centralization and you

1504
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,839
mentioned some of them like the sort of

1505
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,000
quick adoption of standards etc i think

1506
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,599
i would argue that

1507
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,520
that's unlikely to be true over the long

1508
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,520
term so yes there might be some

1509
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,640
short-term gains

1510
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,160
but i think long-term uh yeah privacy

1511
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,760
resilience

1512
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,799
etc is toast um i

1513
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,720
don't see how the there's it's in the

1514
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,839
long-term interest of

1515
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:55,760
of users you know even if it means that

1516
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,319
ipv6 gets adopted more quickly

1517
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,599
uh yeah but all of my uh personal data

1518
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,079
uh

1519
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,240
is now available on the dot web feels

1520
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,280
like a bad

1521
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,160
trade-off um over the long term so i

1522
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:08,720
think

1523
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,280
long term i question if there are any

1524
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,200
meaningful gains

1525
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,880
from it and in terms of

1526
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,880
so what to do about it i do think that

1527
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,920
there needs to be the ability to review

1528
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,119
and challenge sort of new protocols etc

1529
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,599
before they're they're allowed through

1530
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,799
standards

1531
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:33,599
to see if if they do make the problem

1532
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,559
worse

1533
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,720
um and pick up on a point that tommy

1534
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,240
made very

1535
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,359
very well yesterday and maybe intervene

1536
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,520
to improve them

1537
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,119
to try and allow for those significant

1538
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,960
negative side effects to be ameliorated

1539
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,480
in in some way

1540
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,640
but uh yeah otherwise i think this is

1541
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,720
just a disaster

1542
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,240
for the end user and completely against

1543
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:58,480
rfc8890

1544
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,760
thanks thank you dominique

1545
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,200
thanks yeah and i just want to thank you

1546
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,079
yuri for

1547
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,400
for highlighting the complexity and the

1548
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,760
different issues of

1549
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,319
involved in this because it is social

1550
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:15,200
political

1551
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,599
economic it's it's market-based it's

1552
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:18,319
technical

1553
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,720
it's it's very complicated and i really

1554
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,000
appreciate that

1555
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,559
all i want to say is um i just support

1556
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,400
pete's idea about

1557
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,680
um doing something that's iab sponsored

1558
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,079
um you know maybe using the workshop as

1559
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,760
a jumping off point but i think it would

1560
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,359
be great to kind of

1561
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,839
have a discussion ongoing discussion at

1562
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,040
least for a little while

1563
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:41,280
even though ones have already happened

1564
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,319
in the past

1565
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,880
it's a perfect time right now so i'm

1566
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,760
looking for the

1567
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,680
to the iab for some some ideas so thanks

1568
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,079
okay point taken thank you david

1569
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,599
hi david kanazi iab um so first off i

1570
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,400
want to say that

1571
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,079
i agree that this is a complex topic

1572
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,680
that is important like

1573
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,599
to say and i agree that too much

1574
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,200
centralization is bad

1575
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,640
absolutely that said i'm

1576
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,839
very confused as to what the iab or the

1577
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,240
larger scale the ietf community can do

1578
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,480
here because we are not the protocol

1579
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,599
police

1580
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,280
we are not legislators

1581
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,559
so if what is the outcome here if we are

1582
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,079
gonna if we write an rfc that says

1583
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:27,839
centralization is bad

1584
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,160
that's not gonna change the needle a bit

1585
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,040
if we

1586
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,160
um go and have a workshop and say why is

1587
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,400
centralization bad because a b and c

1588
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,000
i don't see that as moving the needle

1589
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,160
either so while i think this is an

1590
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,359
important topic

1591
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,760
i kind of see it as out of scope for the

1592
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,440
itf in general

1593
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,920
all we can do to make sure we don't

1594
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,040
encourage

1595
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,319
um centralization to make sure our

1596
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,520
protocols are open

1597
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,839
and extensible so anyone can do anything

1598
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,440
they want with them but that's been in

1599
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,559
our ethos

1600
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,720
since the beginning so i'm not sure

1601
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,000
there's much more to be done

1602
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,680
from us here yeah

1603
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,240
your point is valid i think and i think

1604
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,799
that

1605
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,960
probably implies that that we can't have

1606
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,960
like this you know broad statements that

1607
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,000
you know this bad

1608
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,040
that good but it puts more pointed

1609
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,160
advice that here

1610
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,599
are techniques that can help in this

1611
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,280
situation thank you uh martin

1612
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,119
yeah so um um

1613
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,839
just to reply because a couple people

1614
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,760
mentioned

1615
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,920
what i had said at plenary with regards

1616
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,280
to this i just want to clarify

1617
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,480
that i very much agree with what david

1618
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,960
said like we cannot be a protocol police

1619
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,559
here um but that we should be just

1620
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,520
focusing on promoting protocols that

1621
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,040
allow

1622
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,319
um distributed

1623
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:54,319
and non-centralized ways of doing things

1624
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,599
and i think there are positive things we

1625
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:56,880
can do

1626
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,640
but we should not be focusing on

1627
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,118
transfer

1628
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,079
thank you yeah so i share the concerns a

1629
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,000
lot of people about centralization in

1630
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,839
many oh by the way martin duke f5

1631
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:15,680
and iesg um i uh i do share the concerns

1632
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,880
a lot of people have about

1633
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,640
centralization in many aspects of the

1634
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,319
internet works um

1635
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,000
i do think that the work of creating

1636
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,799
interoperable standards is inherently

1637
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,359
decentralizing um because you know they

1638
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,319
allow

1639
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,920
you to switch out the vendors for things

1640
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,400
very quite basically i i do

1641
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,400
in my non-expert opinion centralization

1642
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,760
is largely regulatory

1643
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,559
and and legal problem and i remain a

1644
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,640
little skeptical that the itf has the

1645
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,119
levers

1646
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,480
i mean you mentioned one thing here

1647
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,400
which is the client side discovery

1648
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,079
we do things like abd which i think an

1649
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,520
effort to address that

1650
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,240
um i think we've been doing discovery

1651
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,160
techniques for for a long time

1652
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,640
um but i i have trouble seeing the

1653
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,079
letters that ietf has

1654
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,160
to to move the ball forward on this

1655
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,760
thanks

1656
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,200
all right and then ecker

1657
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,440
the last word yeah i mean david and

1658
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,880
martin said a number of things i would

1659
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,280
say

1660
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,640
um i guess you know i

1661
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,680
i think it's important to distinguish

1662
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,359
between things which are um you know

1663
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,480
inherently centralizing

1664
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,400
and being uh in terms of technology and

1665
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,680
things which are not

1666
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,760
so i mean like let's take the web which

1667
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,799
is like inherently decentralized

1668
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,079
technology like you can as many

1669
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,920
websites you want you can have you know

1670
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,200
like people like other websites et

1671
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:25,760
cetera

1672
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,760
and yet when you look at how the web

1673
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,880
practice gets deployed

1674
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,559
you know it's almost impractical for on

1675
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,000
any substantial site

1676
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,280
having using aws or using a cdn or

1677
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,520
hosting or having hosted for you and so

1678
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,359
here we have a situation where

1679
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,799
there is a nominally decentralized

1680
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,880
system that is technically decentralized

1681
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,559
and yet there are powerful economic and

1682
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:46,319
technical reasons why it gets shoved

1683
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,920
into a very small number of boxes

1684
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,040
and so the extent to which you know

1685
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,200
you might ask the iatf to die in the

1686
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,400
system differently but like what would

1687
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:54,880
you have done

1688
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,680
what are you doing to make that

1689
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,000
inherently less centralized and so if

1690
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:58,400
you know

1691
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,599
if we want to do something meaningful

1692
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,760
here then we have to ask is what are the

1693
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,200
technical functions that would

1694
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,839
reverse the incentives towards taking

1695
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,520
things which are nominally decentralized

1696
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,880
and actually centralizing them

1697
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,119
and i think there's a really big open

1698
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,640
question i think um there's been a lot

1699
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,160
of work on it frankly a lot of which i

1700
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,440
don't think works super well

1701
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,520
um and it isn't as persuasive as my hope

1702
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,200
but i think those are the those are the

1703
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,680
anchors that um you know or are the the

1704
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,280
levers that we have to pull if there are

1705
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,760
any

1706
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,119
um and i think uh um you know um

1707
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,799
our rfcs or blog posts about hazard

1708
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,319
realization is bad will not

1709
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,599
it will not have much of an impact

1710
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,000
thank you ecker okay

1711
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,640
okay headed over back to chenbin and

1712
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,000

1713
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,079

unfortunately we have no time left for

1716
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,640
any other open mic um

1717

but feel free to send an email to ib

1718
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,559
ib.org if you want to tell

1719
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,160
us something or have a conversation with

1720
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,079
us i think this conversation can go to

1721
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,160
the architecture discuss list

1722
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,520
and we can i can keep discussing there

1723
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,039
and with that i think we're done sorry

1724

1725
