meeting

10
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
we've got a very short agenda for ietf

11
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,440
110

12
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040

15
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,239
uh

16
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,000
i think it's going to take the minutes

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
thank you

18
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,239
okay so this is the the notes well um

19
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,239
i'm sure you are all very familiar with

20
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,680
this by now

21
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,640
um this basically says any anything you

22
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
say

23
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
uh within this the frame of this ietf

24
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
is uh considered to be a contribution to

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,799
the itf i'll just leave that up

26
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,840
on on the on the screen for a few

27
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,239
seconds

28
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,000
and so any ietf policies related to that

29
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,280
apply

30
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
okay uh blue sheets are done

31
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,720
automatically which is great

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
and azure is taking our minutes thank

33
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
you

34
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,080
so as i mentioned we have a very short

35
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,159
agenda today uh just a quick working

36
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
group status update

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
and then an update on the draft for bfd

38
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,399
for geneve

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,840
any comments of the agenda

40
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,880
okay right uh milestones

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
so um as usual need an update

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
um many of these are completely out of

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
date

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
and but there are possibly one missing

45
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
which is we don't have a milestone for

46
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,759
our young model

47
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
um so we probably ought to help to add

48
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,400
one for the young models

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,000
um in terms of completion of the working

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
groups charter or completion of as much

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,960
as we can do

52
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,400
in the working groups charter and on our

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,639
milestones

54
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,500
now currently we have

55
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,600
[Music]

56
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
some oem drafts in progress

57
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,039
we have a data plane encapsulation which

58
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
has been published we have a whole set

59
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
of other rfcs related to the framework

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
architecture of mvo3 that are being

61
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,320
published

62
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,000
and we have some young models in

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
progress

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,759
um is there anything else i guess the

65
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,479
question is that

66
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,240
at some point we need a discussion on

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
whether that is

68
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,639
complete for the from the perspective of

69
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,000
the working group and if there's

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
anything else that we need to do

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
before wrapping up the working group

72
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,919
that would be valuable to the community

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,960
any comments on that

74
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
so i think the approach should probably

75
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,240
be that

76
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
sam and i will will update the

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
milestones um

78
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,759
and we put a proposal to the list of

79
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,400
what we believe needs to be completed

80
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
uh before we can say that the working

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,520
group is is done

82
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,880
so this is sam speaking as individual

83
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
contributors so we have

84
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,360
two drafts one is bfb and another one is

85
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
the oem pollution

86
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
where are we with the

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
oem solution are we planning to go

88
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,880
forward with that

89
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,800
we have draft authors here so

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,520
correct yes thank you um

91
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,199
good question and thank you for bringing

92
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,600
it up um

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,440
i think that uh the oem draft

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,560
is um don't was

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
adopted last year but it's a stable

96
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,400
and um

97
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
i would can ask a working group to

98
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,840
consider

99
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
adoption poll or

100
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,080
something like early review um

101
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,479
definitely adoption poll will produce

102
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,759
the comments

103
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,319
and then we can address the comments and

104
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,599
i will

105
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,639
um we are committed to work on them uh

106
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,840
right away

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,440
so i think it's uh

108
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,840
reasonable to expect that we'll have it

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,599
um

110
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,800
complete by next um meeting so if

111
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,400
um for example um adoption poll will

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,720
not adoption fall so last call i

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,680
apologize

114
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
last call are issued then our comments

115
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,160
will come and we'll

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,840
address them by next meeting

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,199
so so we have mechanisms as well to to

118
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,039
get wider ietf review

119
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,400
um such as a routing area review

120
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,360
uh for the driver which i think would be

121
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,000
worth doing

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,360
that's a that's a great idea

123
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
so ask routing directorate for early

124
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,840
review

125
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,599
yeah okay

126
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
and as i said we are committed to work

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
yeah okay

128
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,840
any other comments

129
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,000
document status um so we have one new

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
rfc since the last

131
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
uh last time we met as a working group

132
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,360
in the iatf that's rfc

133
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,199
8296 which is geneve

134
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,720
so that's our first standards track rfc

135
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,519
um for the generic network

136
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,559
virtualization

137
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,559
encapsulation so congratulations to the

138
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,240
authors and thank you for your hard work

139
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,559
on addressing the fairly lengthy and

140
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,519
detailed set of

141
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,120
of comments for that um

142
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
we also have a encapsulation draft

143
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
draft itfmvo3ncap that kind of i think

144
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
that was the one that describes the

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
output of the the encapsulation design

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,040
team

147
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
uh we did try and try and last call that

148
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
last year didn't get a lot of responses

149
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,399
on the list

150
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,360
um we did at some point promised that

151
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,480
that would be

152
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
that we would try to publish that

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
document um and we felt that

154
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,200
as a working group it was valuable um at

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,480
the time to

156
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,560
to publish it as really as a way of

157
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,519
documenting

158
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,640
um documenting the experience of one

159
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,519
working group

160
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,720
in picking an encapsulation

161
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,240
when there were multiple candidates on

162
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
the table

163
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,560
but obviously we can't move forward

164
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,480
without sufficient review

165
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
from the working group and consensus

166
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,000
that this is actually something that the

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
community is interested in so i think

168
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,279
probably the way forward this is to run

169
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,880
another working group last call but we

170
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
would obviously like to see

171
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,680
um much better buy-in from the working

172
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
group

173
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,480
on on progressing with this

174
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,440
the i think the editors have also not

175
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,279
been so

176
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,320
so active on this as well

177
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,760
so yes we definitely need a an active

178
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
and active editor or two on this draft

179
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,480
if it's going to move forward

180
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
we also have um some informational

181
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,600
documents on alternative encapsulations

182
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
i think that the one that

183
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
had interest in progressing last time we

184
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,959
discussed this was for

185
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,800
the excellent gpa and so

186
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,320
we probably need to work in group last

187
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
call that as well

188
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,519
but again i think we're going to be

189
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,880
we're going to have to look for

190
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
fairly significant interest from the

191
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,320
working group and some comments and

192
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,800
proper

193
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
level of review from a working group in

194
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,000
order to progress this

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,480
document

196
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
we have a draft related to the control

197
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,279
plane which is these

198
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,720
the applicability of the vpn

199
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,330
to geneve

200
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,760
[Music]

201
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,320
we that went through working group last

202
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,800
call

203
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,920
it's now with martin um it is held in

204
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,200
his queue

205
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,399
waiting for a companion document in the

206
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
best working group that shows the

207
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,760
uh bgp extensions required for geneve

208
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,279
um that so really

209
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,959
we're kind of waiting on on the progress

210
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,359
of that

211
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,600
the virtual machine mobility documents

212
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,760
so that

213
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
was sent back to the working group after

214
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,440
after review by martin

215
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,839
um there are some comments from martin

216
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,519
about it being not

217
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,839
really specific to nvo3 i don't know if

218
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
martin if you want to say anything

219
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,560
more about that at this time

220
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,920
go ahead martin i think you should be

221
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,839
able to

222
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,839
martin there's a problem with your audio

223
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,680
do you hear me yes nowadays okay

224
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,200
yes on that specific document uh i think

225
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,600
i

226
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,160
uh i had communicated back uh to the

227
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,720
working group my expectations

228
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,200
uh i know that um

229
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,800
donald had tried to uh

230
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
work a bit help the authors to rework a

231
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,279
bit the document

232
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,279
but still i think there are a number of

233
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,200
questions that the the working group

234
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,920
needs to

235
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,680
uh needs to bring an answer to

236
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,040
and what would be great if

237
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,839
uh would be that you the chance helped

238
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,680
drive that discussion

239
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,040
uh to see where it leads

240
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,800
okay thank you um

241
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,320
yang models um so we have

242
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,800
a configuration model for nvo3

243
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
um i believe there's also a young model

244
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
for geneva as well which isn't listed on

245
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
here sam i think you were looking at

246
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,120
uh shepherding these these drafts do you

247
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,000

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
this draft was adopted by his working

272
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,560
group

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
in november last year i present

274
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,920
the 01 version of the working group job

275
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,800
next slide please

276
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,959
this is the summary of the main updates

277
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,160
from zero zero version to the rewind

278
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,760
version

279
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,560
and the first one is to update the

280
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,240
latest

281
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,160
status of two most valid

282
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
reference the documents they are

283
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,320
genevieve document

284
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,639
and vfd for the extent document

285
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,360
the new tunnel encapsulation has been

286
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,120
published as rc

287
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,920
8926 and the bfd 4x10

288
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,800
has been published as rc

289
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,480
8971

290
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,199
and the second main update is to resolve

291
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,040
the open issues with pfd

292
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
over internet over genevieve

293
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,240
encapsulation

294
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
including number one if the

295
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,199
vip of the original mve has no

296
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,880
gs then what are you just to be used

297
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,040
for ipv4 or ipv6

298
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,120
number two if the vip of the terminating

299
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
me has no ip address

300
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
then what idea just to be used for ipv4

301
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,680
or ipv6

302
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,240
the third main update is to clarify the

303
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,360
exchange of

304
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
vfd discriminator if needed

305
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,560
next slide please

306
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,399
uh for the pfd for genius

307
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,720
except for geneve tunnel encapsulation

308
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,240
uh bfd for vxlan is also uh

309
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,000
one of the most relevant documents

310
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,359
which is now rfc 8971

311
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,720
considering the semantic similarities

312
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,359
between uh bfd for genevieve and the bfd

313
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:11,760
for

314
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,240
x-lan the pfp4g document

315
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,720
would reuse obviously uh

316
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,559
8971 as much as possible

317
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,359
otherwise there are two main differences

318
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,440
between uh bfd 4gb

319
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,480
and obviously 89

320
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
71. uh

321
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
number one uh pfd for uh gnu

322
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
specifies uh non-management to bni

323
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,640
solution nevertheless uh rc

324
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,720
8971 specifies management vi

325
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
uh solution uh

326
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
for uh completeness

327
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,160
we plan uh to also uh the

328
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,320
management vi solution in this job

329
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,799
uh by referencing to geneve oem

330
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,760
working group dropped

331
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,200
that chapter provides specifics

332
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,919
for the requirements on both

333
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,720
non-management

334
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,760
bni solution and the management vi

335
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,600
solution

336
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,080
as well as how to achieve management of

337
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
ai solution

338
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,039
in the case of genevieve

339
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,799
number two uh bfd for genevieve

340
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,840
use ipo genevieve as well as ethernet

341
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
over genevieve

342
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,240
nevertheless rc rc 8971

343
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
use only isn't it

344
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,240
over vxlan due to uh vaccine

345
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,840
characteristics exercise please

346
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,960
uh as mentioned uh just now uh the xero1

347
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,520
version

348
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,440
draft resolves the open issues with

349
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
bfd over internet over geneve

350
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
encapsulation

351
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,520
this is the open issue bond and its

352
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,120
resolution

353
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,120
the open issue is that if the vip of the

354
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,080
originating

355
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,280
mve has no iphs

356
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,840
then what i'd be addressed to use for

357
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
ipv4 or ipv6

358
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,400
in zero zero version draft

359
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
in this scenario the ipo address of the

360
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,320
originating mve is used

361
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,600
uh nevertheless in zero one version

362
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,039
draft

363
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,840
in this scenario the iphone

364
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,559
0.0.0 for ipv4 or

365
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,679
colon column slash

366
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,120
128 for ipv6 should be used

367
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,799
that's because 0.0.0.0 for ipv4 or

368
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,360
column current slash 128 for ipv6

369
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,880
is unspecified address

370
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,919
according to rbc 4291

371
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,440
an ipv6 packet with a source measure

372
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,799
address of unspecified

373
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,000
must never be forwarded by an ipv6

374
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
router so we think that

375
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,360
in this scenario using the unspecified

376
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
address

377
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,320
is more suitable than using the ip

378
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,000
address of the

379
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,120
originating mae

380
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,799
next slide is

381
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,600
uh this is the opening issue two and its

382
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
resolution

383
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,559
uh this open issue is that uh if the

384
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,840
vip of the terminating me has no ip

385
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,880
address

386
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,600
then what i'd be addressed to use for

387
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,360
ipv4 or ipv6

388
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,880
uh in zero zero version job two in this

389
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,480
scenario the iph

390
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,600
must be chosen from the

391
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,320
column current ffff

392
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,240
column 127.0.0.0

393
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,039
104 range for ipv6

394
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,640
uh nevertheless indeed in the third one

395
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,360
version dropped in this scenario the ip

396
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,320
address

397
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,440
should be set to

398
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,600
column column one slash one two eight

399
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,799
for ipv6 that's because

400
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
uh column column one slash one two eight

401
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,360
for ipv6 is a loopback address

402
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,200
uh according to obviously 42

403
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,320
91 an ipv6 packet

404
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,559
with the destination address of loopback

405
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,080
must never be sent outside of a

406
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,960
single node and must never be forwarded

407
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,559
by an

408
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,760
ipv6 router

409
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,760
in this scenario they used ip address

410
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,880
for

411
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,720
ipv4 doesn't change

412
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,600
it should still be selected from the

413
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
range

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,559
one two seven slash eight

415
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,039
if there is also a suggestion to change

416
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,080
the

417
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,840
use the idea just for ipv4

418
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,879
please let us know

419
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,840
next slide please

420
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,280
so uh with the open issues and the

421
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,080
resolutions

422
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,679
why do we need to use vfd over internet

423
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,320
over

424
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,840
geneve instead of cfm over

425
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,120
internet over geneve

426
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,559
i think this is a remaining question

427
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,400
there are three reasons for the

428
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,760
answering this question

429
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
from the authors number one in some

430
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,840
scenarios using one om protocol is

431
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,480
beneficial

432
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,080
for example that can

433
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,480
reduce the amount of code

434
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
if we use both bftoip

435
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,960
over genevieve and cfm over internet

436
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
over geneve

437
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,600
then different sets of codes is needed

438
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
number two the authors

439
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,720
assume that dc operators are unwilling

440
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,320
to learn and operate

441
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,360
to totally different oem mechanisms

442
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,400
if they are going to deploy both ip

443
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,559
service and ethernet service

444
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,840
in their dc networks

445
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,320
number three uh last but not least

446
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,360
the authors are in favor of vfd

447
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,279
much more than other oem mechanism

448
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,640
i here such as a

449
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,000
cfm that is

450
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,320
defined in ioe

451
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,840
802.1 next slide please

452
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,720
in zero one version chapter

453
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,600
the third main update is to clarify the

454
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,360
exchange of

455
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,520
bfd discriminator if needed

456
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,720
exchange of bfd discriminator

457
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,799
is deemed optional and outside the scope

458
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,960
of this job firstly uh

459
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,240
the out of band the exchange of bfd

460
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,919
discriminator

461
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
is an optional add-on

462
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,720
which is not necessary because as

463
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,440
stated in this job as the receiving side

464
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,360
the bfd control package can also be

465
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,799
demultiplexed with your discriminator

466
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,120
equals to zero uh if out-of-band

467
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,240
exchange of bfd discriminator is

468
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,799
used then there are multiple methods

469
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,360
that can achieve it for example

470
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,600
echo request reply can be used

471
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
bgp evpn can be used

472
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,760
and open flow can be used too

473
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,840
that's like this

474
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,440
next steps we are revising this chapter

475
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
to resolve further comments and

476
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,480
then asked for working group last call

477
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
that's all thank you

478
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:53,840
thank you any comments

479
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,520
okay um i think that's with the the oem

480
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
geneve draft it'll be worth getting a

481
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
routine area review of this

482
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,720
i'm wondering if we shouldn't also get a

483
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,640
ask for a review from the bfd working

484
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,200
group

485
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,279
um i appreciate it it's the same group

486
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,240
of people

487
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,679
mostly so i have actually one question

488
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,200
speaking as individual contributor here

489
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,679
so what's the decision about the ip

490
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,640
header

491
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,919
you plan to use local localhost type

492
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:35,840
address or what exactly was the decision

493
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,000
uh sorry do you mean destination

494
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,760
ip address yes

495
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,159
so for which encapsulation uh do you

496
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,440
mean the bfto

497
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,720
isn't that over genevieve yes

498
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,880
uh destination ip i i think uh

499
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,120
for ipv4 we use the

500
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,440
uh the range we will choose the ip

501
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,480
address from the

502
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,080
range y from one to seven slash

503
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,399
eight so for ipv6

504
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,840
uh in this version in this

505
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,039
zero by version we use

506
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,399
the column current one

507
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,000
slash one two eight

508
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,480
so uh the uh destination

509
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,520
host or nve whichever is processing

510
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,039
these bfd

511
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,159
frames needs to open a udp socket

512
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,360
for 127 address is that right

513
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,199
yeah i think so

514
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,678
interesting

515
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,080
is it done similarly for other uh

516
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,480
vxlan as well or is it purely for geneve

517
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,960
uh because as i said

518
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,240
uh in rc uh

519
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,640
89 50 71

520
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,080
the bfd for the extent solution is for

521
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,679
management vni so uh

522
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,799
it's a yeah there's

523
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,000
some difference in this job

524
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,279
we uh provides the we provide the

525
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,520
solutions for uh non-management bni

526
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,720
so uh yeah there's some difference

527
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,360
between

528
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,158
these two jobs

529
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,639
uh greg you can speak

530
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,000
um it's very interesting

531
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,120
question so um when we

532
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,200
uh discussed the deal with vxlan

533
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,320
so it was pointed out that

534
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,000
um ipv4 uh

535
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,520
loopback addresses mapped in ipv6

536
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,080
they don't have a special meaning so the

537
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,520
only loopback

538
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,880
ip address that exists in ipv6 is

539
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,880
uh 1 28.

540
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,399
so functionally

541
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,480
for ipv6 if we use a loopback address

542
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,320
range for ipv4 addresses

543
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,520
then in ipv6 we can use only single

544
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,159
address

545
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,919
one slash 128 and that's what

546
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,080
recommended in um geneve oem

547
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,919
document that ip encapsulated control

548
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,960
packets

549
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,720
uh use um addresses

550
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,840
from ipv4 loopback range

551
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,559
or one slash 128 for ipv6

552
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,240
so in that regard uh bfd document

553
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,279
and uh genevam documents are consistent

554
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,200
i see so purely for v4 in this case

555
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,080
if you don't have ip on the source and

556
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,399
also ip on the destination

557
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,240
so you are planning to use 127 address

558
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,880
is that right

559
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,679
um if there is no uh

560
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,320
ip of

561
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
well

562
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,840
this this goes to um

563
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,959
nbe so which terminates geneve

564
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,240
so it doesn't go to the tenant i can

565
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,960
imagine that tenant doesn't have

566
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,880
ip but i would imagine that

567
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,080
in the e will have ip

568
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,279
uh wouldn't that be the case no i'm just

569
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,200
echoing the the issues at hand

570
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,640
in the slides where you mentioned no ips

571
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,399
i was little bit curious

572
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,200
so nvs do not have ip right so i'm not

573
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,240
talking about that

574
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
oh okay right uh again um

575
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,039
that's that's a little bit because

576
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:25,760
basically

577
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,000
uh the premise of this is that it

578
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,440
terminates on that

579
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,720
law because it wants to

580
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,760
test as much as possible of

581
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,039
um their

582
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,159
infrastructure right so

583
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,519
um yeah

584
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,519
um again that that's that's the case if

585
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,360
um that doesn't have ip

586
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,240
then uh i would imagine that ethernet

587
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,279
encapsulation

588
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,159
will be in place

589
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,039
okay anyway i'll take a look at it and

590
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,760
uh

591
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,799
yeah thank you uh yeah

592
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,840
yes uh

593
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,279
another is for the non-management of ai

594
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,600
so uh this job to only describes the

595
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,640
non-management of vmi solution

596
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,039
so for now management bi uh

597
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,279
we provide two encapsulations first is

598
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,640
ip over uh eft over ip

599
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,039
over geneve another is

600
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,120
isn't that a bfd over ethernet of a

601
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,559
geneve

602
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,679
so for the second one there's a

603
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,440
scenario that the

604
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,720
uh web vip of the

605
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,559
originating mae or the web

606
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,840
of the terminating me has no ip address

607
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,359
so for for this uh specific scenario

608
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,879
uh we provide resolution so there are

609
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,440
openings

610
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,399
one and obviously to adjust for this

611
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,199
specific

612
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,359
scenario i just mentioned

613
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
okay any other comments

614
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,639
okay um so with that that was our first

615
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,079
and last session presentation

616
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,599
um thank you for for joining um please

617
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,480
look out for

618
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,639
requests on the list for a review of the

619
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,639
various drafts that we need to complete

620
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,320
um and last call at some point in the

621
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,119
near future and with that

622
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,839
any other would anybody like to raise

623
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,119
any other issues with the working group

624
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,280
okay well i think that closes the

625
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,359
meeting thank you

626
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
and uh hopefully see you see you at the

627
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,119
next ietf wherever that might be online

628
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:23,520
or

629
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:31,839
or somewhere else thank you

630
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,880
it's
