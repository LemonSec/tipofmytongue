you watch

42
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,159
the session on youtube you don't really

43
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,400
know who's talking

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,440
okay so we got a note-taker uh we have a

45
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,000
document

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
update and we'll talk about acne

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
integrations

48
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,239
and the dtn node and next steps

49
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,360
before we get to the document updates uh

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,319
a little public service announcement

51
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
rich has decided to step down as

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,440
co-chair of acme so

53
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,760
we're also looking for a volunteer to

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,680
replace rich you can contact me

55
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,680
or the ids but not right now

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,440
let's do this after the meeting

57
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,519
okay so let's go with the

58
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,879
document updates

59
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,879
so um the email last mime is

60
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
already in the rfc pipeline star

61
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,480
delegation

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
is an itf last call

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,400
acme authority token is waiting for ist

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,200
review

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,680
so the token tn oauth list just

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,440
submitted an update waiting for ad

67
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,959
review

68
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,080
and we've got presentations here for

69
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,280
dtn node id integrations and subdomains

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,880
regarding regarding itf acme client

71
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
no recent update or discussions

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
so next slide

73
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
did they know the c presentation okay

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,479
let's see the presentation

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,280
all right brian you're up yes thank you

76
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,759
um so some of this content is duplicated

77
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,720
but left in for

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,360
background so you can go on to the next

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
slide

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
for those not familiar with dtn it is a

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
store and forward kind of a protocol

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
similar to

83
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,960
mime and the way that the email systems

84
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
work

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
and so the workflow of this validation

86
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,919
method

87
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
is really taken almost exactly as the

88
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,199
same as

89
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,639
the s mime validation next slide please

90
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
and the point of why this draft is being

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,800
proposed

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
we talked about this on the last ietf

93
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,000
but the idea here is that

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
acme has all of the infrastructure and

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,400
bookkeeping and all the necessary things

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
to do

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,039
p kicks validation and

98
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,639
there's a need in the dtn uh to be able

99
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,520
to do this kind of thing

100
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,759
when a new node comes onto the network

101
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
and needs to be

102
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
validated the same way that

103
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
a new email user might for an sbm

104
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,440
certificate

105
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,600
and next slide please

106
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
so so the the flow that is in the

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,639
email s9 draft is um

108
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,000
basically duplicated here uh with this

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,440
other encoding this other transport um

110
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,840
we're going to define an administrative

111
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,880
record for

112
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,160
for the bundle protocol and then the

113
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,319
acme server generates a part one a part

114
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,360
two

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
transport those two different paths and

116
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,479
then

117
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,080
the um dtn client that's doing the

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,440
validating of their identifier combines

119
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,880
them and sends back the response

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,080
next slide please

121
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,400
so uh the

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,800
because the blackout period for the the

123
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
internet draft updates

124
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,680
i wasn't able to update draft until

125
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,960
um just early this week but i did uh

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
submit a zero one version of the draft

127
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,560
that had some

128
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,759
clarification and updates uh this is

129
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,720
experimental

130
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,440
uh draft the idea is that this would not

131
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
be widely implemented

132
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
in acme but it is a way to use

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,560
the acting mechanism to do what we need

134
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,240
to do for

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
dtn id validation

136
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
and i believe this is the last slide

137
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,440
right

138
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,800
yes so at this point now um

139
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
the last changes to the draft were to to

140
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
clarify some encodings

141
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,520
some data encodings um to use native

142
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
uh byte strings instead of base 64 just

143
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,599
for slight efficiencies

144
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,680
but this the structure is really the

145
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,759
same and um

146
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,479
a lot of some supporting text was taken

147
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,759
in from

148
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,039
the changes to the s mime draft um so

149
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,840
this is more in alignment with the what

150
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
was approved for s mime

151
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,599
and at this point i have spent a little

152
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,720
bit of time

153
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,319
on a demonstration implementation

154
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,400
just as a proof of concept and that's

155
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
where things stand right now

156
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,919
okay so this already is a working group

157
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,360
raft

158
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,880
but what are you looking

159
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,640
good for do you think that's ready for

160
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,439
our last call

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,880
uh because of the simplicity and because

162
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,959
the alignment with the s mime

163
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,800
um i don't believe that there are any

164
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
further changes necessary yes so

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
oh and the other thing to mention is

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
that the

167
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
the bundled protocol drafts on which

168
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,279
this

169
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,720
were relying on for encoding and for for

170
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,519
transport

171
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
those have been moved to the the editor

172
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,880
queue

173
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,240
so those are now stabilized whereas in

174
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,040
the past they

175
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,320
really were still in slight flux

176
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,680
so there should be no need for

177
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,479
for further changes

178
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,519
the thing i'm worried about is if i now

179
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,040
do the uh

180
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,519
one of these audience polls the show of

181
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
hands

182
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
and ask how many people have read either

183
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
version of the draft

184
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,279
um do you think we're going to get more

185
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
than five

186
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
um i doubt that

187
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,040
right um so we could do the working

188
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
group last call

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,720
hopefully get

190
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,959
some uh replies about it soon

191
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,000
um let's ask a different way

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,440
anyone opposed to us having uh

193
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,640
having a working group last call i think

194
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,000
i saw roman there for a

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
moment yeah go ahead all right i was

196
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,079
just gonna jump in

197
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,920
uh you know as brian has kind of

198
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
indicated this is a bit of a

199
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
very narrowly focused kind of use case

200
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
we did decide to adopt it

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
so an approach we could try is to go to

202
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,519
work group last call

203
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,079
and if we get enough folks to have put

204
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,800
eyes on it

205
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,959
we and we work the results we can

206
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,640
proceed if we don't get enough

207
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
review then we can have another

208
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
conversation about how we can get more

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,360
review here

210
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,079
okay has the dtn community looked at

211
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,319
this

212
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,200
guessing this is an answer a question

213
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,519
for you

214
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,360
uh there has been some uh

215
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
looking at this from the dtn side that

216
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
the two things

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,240
that are new

218
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,560
here uh the one that's stated here is

219
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,680
that this does

220
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
create a new claim type for uris so

221
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,279
just making sure that the text in here

222
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
for uri claims

223
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,560
uri identifiers is reasonable and

224
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,279
complete

225
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,680
that's one of the i think focus areas

226
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
and

227
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,120
if anybody has implementation experience

228
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,640
or feedback from the

229
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,200
s mime draft because this is the same

230
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
effectively the same workflow as the s

231
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
mime draft

232
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,839
anybody who's familiar with the s

233
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,800
minecraft should be able to

234
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
at least understand the workflow here

235
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
and be able to give feedback

236
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,160
okay so i guess uh we have a plan for

237
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
how to proceed any

238
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,680
objections to this plan of just going to

239
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,200
working with platco and

240
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,120
hopefully getting enough reviews to

241
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,279
matter

242
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,079
we're going once going twice okay so

243
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,199
this is what we're going to do

244
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
so thank you brian and

245
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,839
next presentation is acme integrations

246
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,040
um we can go on to the next

247
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
an slide draft that describes how acme

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
can be integrated with multiple existing

249
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
clients and device certain enrollment

250
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,279
mechanisms without requiring any changes

251
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,760
so what's documented in this version of

252
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,120
the draft is est

253
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
risking risky cloud and tip integrations

254
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,760
and it doesn't change any of the

255
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,920
specifications for a usd risky

256
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,680
or type it just stitches them together

257
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,320
next slide

258
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
so there's been one change since the

259
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
previous draft in igf-109 and there was

260
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
one open item

261
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
which is how do we handle the risky

262
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,320
requirements

263
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,360
that uh the briskey

264
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,480
and then to research the brisket

265
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
registrar itself has an identity search

266
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,040
with an idkp cmc ra

267
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,959
um eku set um and

268
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,800
the conclusion that we've reached is

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
that um even if the briske ra is

270
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,279
is in the middle acting as um

271
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,040
essentially a proxy that lets a pledge

272
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
get a certificate from

273
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,120
acme the briskey area itself cannot get

274
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,600
a

275
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
certificate from an acme server that is

276
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,040
not willing to give it an idk pcmc array

277
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
so for example let's encrypt is not

278
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
going to wish you an identity search

279
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,320
with idkb cmc or asset

280
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,040
and so if the ra even though the ra may

281
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,680
be

282
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
getting acme certificates on behalf of

283
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
pledges

284
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
the ra itself may not be able to get an

285
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
acme certificate for itself

286
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
the acme server it's integrating with

287
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,839
is not willing to issue the ra an idkp

288
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,360
cmc

289
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,560
an idk pcmc or am eku

290
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,880
and which just means that the the risky

291
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,079
registrar itself

292
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,560
may have to get uh one identity

293
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,079
the change and that's been clarified on

294
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,120
multiple mailers

295
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,079
and that has been explicitly documented

296
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,480
in

297
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,399
draft04

298
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,880
and that's it next steps

299
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
right

300
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,720
next slide please and this is just

301
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
discussion and we were looking for

302
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,519
reviewers

303
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,800
and uh feedback and we believe that

304
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,920
we've no changes

305
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
to make on this and it's ready for last

306
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,199
call and but we would like some

307
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,920
reviewers please

308
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
oh and i have a question um

309
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,720
on the id kpcmcra that's in

310
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,760
extended key usage oid correct

311
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,040
correct yes do

312
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,639
certificates have multiple end

313
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
eku's in them in general

314
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,600
for briskee do

315
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,720
you have multiple ek well the circuit of

316
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,639
multiple different bits set for extended

317
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,680
key usage but the

318
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
the one that's important for brewski is

319
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
the

320
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
the brewski masa checks for that page in

321
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,519
the certainties from the risky area

322
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,440
gotcha but yeah

323
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,399
so no my question was for example in um

324
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
i'm drawing a blank on what it's called

325
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,399
you know the the secure ip stuff

326
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,120
um there's multiple eku's defined

327
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,480
but the rfc says

328
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
you can't tell you can't fail to

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,320
validate if they're not there

330
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,079
this is different from that and you're

331
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
acquiring one

332
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,759
and the users could have other eku's in

333
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,480
there which

334
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,160
are unaffected is that true the

335
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,440
the users there was the relying parties

336
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
the consumers of the service

337
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,639
they could have they could have all the

338
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,800
requests in there yet okay

339
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,120
thanks

340
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,440
but but the the one that the one that

341
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,519
was contentious is the

342
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,839
is this one because yeah the drafts all

343
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,120
but acting integrations we know that

344
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
let's encrypt

345
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,040
which is most isn't going to hand it out

346
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,759
um

347
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,480
so they're just that caveat that the

348
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,680
brisky ray itself

349
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,360
needs to search from a different city

350
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,240
than the pledges

351
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,120
thank you thank you any questions yes

352
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,839
russ

353
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,280
so it's my understanding that that

354
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,079
particular eku will only ever be used

355
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,799
with

356
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,000
cmp if you're an ra so um

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,359
it's really hard to see how it would

358
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,839
affect acme

359
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,880
um but it's it's it's for the brisket

360
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
integration use case russell when

361
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
when you're using so the brisk array

362
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,760
the pledge talks to briskera and

363
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,280
actually i don't have a picture of i

364
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,559
don't have a picture of the architecture

365
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:34,960
in this

366
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
presentation but the breeze the slides

367
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,240
will talk to the brisk array and the

368
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,679
risk array will have two backend

369
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,280
integrations once in a massive server

370
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,720
one to acme

371
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,160
um and the ra will go to

372
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,720
the oreo will go to the massive first to

373
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,160
get a voucher and this will issue a

374
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,600
voucher to the pledge

375
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
and it's for that interaction that the

376
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,880
master will check that the

377
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,919
um the bruce keys the brewski

378
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,160
ras and identity cert has that bit set

379
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
and then it's a completely independent

380
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
interaction between the

381
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,919
or a and acme to get a cert on behalf of

382
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:10,559
the

383
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,000
pledge and that bit doesn't play any

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,039
role in that interaction so that eku bit

385
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,000
is only needed for

386
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,039
getting for the ra to get a voucher

387
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,679
from the master server and that bit

388
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,400
isn't set

389
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,440
when the ra is getting a certificate

390
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
from acme to hand back their pledge

391
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,919
so that's all consistent with what i

392
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,919
with what i know

393
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,280
okay okay and we're just like we're just

394
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,000
we're explicitly calling out in the in

395
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
the document that the

396
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,000
ra itself can't get its own identity

397
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,960
cert itself

398
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,760
from acme because then the r isn't going

399
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
to be able to present that

400
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,039
and then to research to the mass in

401
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,799
order to get a voucher on behalf of

402
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
pledge

403
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,960
okay hendrick

404
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,240
so this is henrik um don't please

405
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,280
correct me if i'm

406
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,480
wrong i um understand this extended

407
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,000
usage as the indication that this is an

408
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,520
array and this is

409
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,600
required by est in the the

410
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,760
7030 drop it is was

411
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,960
initially introduced by cmc and

412
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,400
we also tend to reuse it

413
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,520
also for cmp so to have one

414
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,200
let's say unique extended key usage

415
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,240
identification

416
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,600
for an array and therefore you're

417
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,360
probably right

418
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,559
an acme server will not issue or

419
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,360
enroll a certificate with this key usage

420
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,919
and

421
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,320
i feel like it's a good idea not to do

422
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,960
that

423
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,240
completely automatically just based on a

424
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,600
domain validation

425
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,960
because it's a specific role this entity

426
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,919
has the ra role and this is indicated by

427
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,200
by this extended key usage so okay i

428
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
think it's okay

429
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,520
okay good

430
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,840
um yes then

431
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,760
i have to say allow twice what um so you

432
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
can hear me

433
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,840
yeah um so the brewski

434
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,158
end of things is all cmp based

435
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,760
not cnc based the brisky

436
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,000
side of things is just getting the

437
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,640
signed voucher which

438
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,200
whatever the json route performance uh i

439
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,000
need to i can't

440
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,720
recall the rfc off my head and but the

441
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,520
brewski flow

442
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,919
the brisket float where the ore is

443
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,600
interacting with the massive servers

444
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,120
just to get designed vouchers to hand

445
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,080
back their pledge

446
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,200
so that the pledge trusts the ra

447
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,360
right russ's comment was that you need

448
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,240
that for cmp

449
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,559
um can we let russ talk

450
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,480
yeah ruskin duck so brewski's est based

451
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,200
and that particular key usage

452
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,120
is needed if you're going to be

453
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,400
an r.a and all i think they're saying

454
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,919
is that you can't use acme to get an

455
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,039
ra certificate and that seems fine

456
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,360
yeah yeah i got that part right and that

457
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
makes complete sense and i am in

458
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,080
complete agreement that you don't want

459
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,240
acme issuing ra search because

460
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,039
that would be bad very bad my question

461
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:55,520
is

462
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,200
do you need the extension the eku

463
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,640
for cmp or cmc they're doing est

464
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,240
which is can be both right

465
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,440
so it's needed for cmc it

466
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,799
is being added to cmp and lamps right

467
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:13,679
now

468
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,640
and i think est uses it but sorry my

469
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,520
memory's not

470
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,799
that good i think he so

471
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,679
est uses like you can do some things in

472
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,080
cmc and some things in cmp

473
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
like it's a sort of a mixed bag as i

474
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,720
recall

475
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,110
i'm asking because i'm debating on

476
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,400
[Music]

477
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,120
agreeing to review the draft

478
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
and i don't know much about cmp so if

479
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
it's all cmp stuff i'm not going to

480
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,159
volunteer

481
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,200
because i don't really know anything

482
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,000
about cmp

483
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,200
i need to go back and i need to go back

484
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,880
and read the read these to draft in

485
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,679
detail again

486
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,880
to answer that question deb right but

487
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,159
your draft is not

488
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,919
it's my question is whether your draft

489
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
is like cmp ish

490
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,520
or whether i can read the draft not

491
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,520
knowing much about cmp

492
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,600
you can read the draft you can read the

493
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,679
draft without not much about cmp

494
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,600
okay so i can read the draft it looks

495
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,360
like it's short it's like it's 17 pages

496
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,120
long it sounds like

497
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,880
it short and there's quite a few figures

498
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,880
in there

499
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,159
oh good pictures are better

500
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,919
so i can review if you would like great

501
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,440
thank you

502
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
and it does not go into too many details

503
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,880
in cmb or cmc

504
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
um okay so um

505
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
if no one else is in the queue uh do you

506
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,320
uh when do you think that uh this is uh

507
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,159
ready for working with last call we

508
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,039
will get the reviewers there i think so

509
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,559
yeah once we get to reviewers yeah i

510
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
think we're we're good to go with it

511
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,159
i don't mind anyways so obvious question

512
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:58,480
uh

513
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
anybody opposed to going to working

514
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,840
group last call

515
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
good i like this silence okay so we'll

516
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,240
start to working with last calls

517
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,400
um after well next week

518
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
okay so i think when you're also doing

519
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,919
the

520
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,360
uh last thing the subdomain so

521
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,039
which can you put on those slides

522
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
oh there they are okay so

523
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,520
quantum next slide please

524
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,880
so i can be allowed not a server to

525
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,520
issue search for given identifier

526
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,919
um without requiring a challenge to be

527
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,279
supposed to be fulfilled against that

528
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,480
identifier

529
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,559
and like for example an acme cert can

530
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,720
issue a search

531
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
for food that part of the example.com

532
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
where the client has only

533
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,919
fulfilled a challenge against one of the

534
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,840
parents authorized domain names part of

535
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,960
example the comrades

536
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,799
um on a server creation search for

537
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,840
multiple

538
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,159
for a number of um some of them inserts

539
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,520
that only require a single challenge to

540
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,279
be filled against the parent domain that

541
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,640
that's really nice when you want to

542
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,320
scale to use acme to issue certs

543
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,640
and automatically for a large number of

544
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,240
identity search for devices here

545
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
internet

546
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,720
cases um we do an authorization once for

547
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,279
a

548
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,919
top level domain or our apparent domain

549
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,120
and then we could use acme to

550
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,840
automatically

551
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,480
search for for hundreds or thousands of

552
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,960
uh

553
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,720
and density devices um

554
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,200
next slide

555
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,440
so changes and we've recorded the

556
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,960
submitter feedback

557
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,480
immediately one online we've

558
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,080
incorporated

559
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
and one of the strong piece of feedback

560
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,520
was to restrict the challenge type to

561
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,760
dns01 specifically for the subdomain use

562
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,960
case

563
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,480
so what that means is that um a dns of

564
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,919
one challenge must be fulfilled against

565
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,360
a parent authorized domain name and

566
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,760
author

567
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
in order to issue certs for a sub-domain

568
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,960
identifier

569
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
um we've also included and text in

570
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,520
the latest draft to address the two open

571
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,279
items that were raised

572
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,799
on the mailer and discussed briefly at

573
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,880
the last itf109

574
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
next slide

575
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,120
this is the first of the open items and

576
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
the open items does the client

577
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,080
need a mechanism to indicate to the

578
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
server that they're

579
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,080
willing and enabled capable of

580
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,000
fulfilling challenges against parent

581
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,240
domains so for example for the food

582
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,880
appear

583
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,000
that example the calm identifier should

584
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,799
the challenge

585
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,159
should the client be able to explicitly

586
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,240
tell the server that it's it actually

587
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
has like the dns keys or whatever it

588
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
needs to fill a challenge against prior

589
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,679
to example.com or example.com

590
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,039
and one of the things that was raised on

591
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,960
the mailer during discussions was that

592
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,240
we want to avoid

593
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,720
the scenario where a server could issue

594
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,159
a challenge against a parent

595
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,080
identifier that the client is not

596
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,919
authorized to fulfill a challenge

597
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,880
against

598
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
for example a client

599
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,000
issues an order for food a pirate

600
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,080
example.com a server issues a challenge

601
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
for example account but the client

602
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,039
doesn't have the dns keys for publishing

603
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,799
tax records to fill that challenge

604
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,240
against the parent domain we want to

605
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,399
avoid that scenario

606
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,440
um so what so what i propose and this

607
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,440
hasn't been reviewed in detail yet so

608
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,760
this is what i proposed is um and this

609
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,559
is based on

610
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,000
inferring some comments that ryan and

611
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
philippe and a few people have made on

612
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,720
demanders as well

613
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,799
is we could include an optional and

614
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,120
boolean flag

615
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,600
um associated with an identifier in the

616
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
new order new whatsapp request

617
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,440
and that optional flag indicates whether

618
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
the client has control over all parent

619
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
at the ends or not

620
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,919
and because i believe typically for for

621
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:52,720
cas

622
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,559
um they'll base your logic off the

623
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,960
top level domain example.com not off

624
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,279
things like birth example.com

625
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,080
um so if this flag is true then the

626
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,279
server may issue

627
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,279
if the client includes this flag and the

628
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,880
flag is through then the server

629
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,240
knows it can issue a challenge against

630
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,640
any of the parent um edn's

631
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,919
and the client will be capable of

632
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,000
fulfilling a challenge against them if

633
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,880
the client sets this flag as false

634
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
then the client is telling the server i

635
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,840
can't fulfill the challenge against any

636
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,120
parent domain the only thing i'm

637
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,480
authorized to fill the challenge against

638
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,159
is the explicit um

639
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,399
the explicit mfqdn that i'm requesting

640
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,600
so that's the only thing i want to

641
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,039
challenge for

642
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,880
um well this slide looks a little

643
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,559
smaller apologies but

644
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,679
uh i just cut and pasted some uh

645
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,640
text from the draft which shows what the

646
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,559
parent-to-main authorization looks like

647
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,320
it's just an extra brilliant flag that

648
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,600
is optionally associated with the

649
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,039
identifier

650
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,159
um and i think well we can debate we

651
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,000
should actually debate what the

652
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,159
logic should be if that isn't included

653
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,440
and i think if

654
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,960
the flag isn't included it should

655
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,279
default to true probably

656
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,760
and because that's the behavior that and

657
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,279
baseline acme

658
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,600
has baseline acme doesn't make any

659
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,120
assumptions about this at all so it's

660
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,360
left entirely of the server policy

661
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,440
um but so i've one follow-on question

662
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
for this proposal if you go onto the

663
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,679
next slide

664
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,159
so next slide please and the question i

665
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,399
have is that sufficiently granular

666
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,880
like um is there any need for a client

667
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,799
to be able to specify a subset of parent

668
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,200
ada into this control over for example

669
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,720
the client wants to search for food that

670
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,640
pair the example.org

671
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,720
and i it can control the power of the

672
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,399
example that are but not the top level

673
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,440
domain

674
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,760
and do we need that level of flexibility

675
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,600
and um i don't think we do

676
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,000
but i'd like to discuss that and other

677
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,840
documented interact for

678
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,200
is that we don't need that level of

679
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,799
flexibility and just a simple boolean

680
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,559
flag is efficient

681
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,919
and so what's shown on the right-hand

682
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,320
side again this

683
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
the rendering isn't that big in this

684
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
page but it shows

685
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,520
um underneath the identifier

686
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,360
is an array of videos that the client is

687
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,799
actually authorized to

688
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,880
fulfill a challenge against yeah that's

689
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,000
better so you scroll

690
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,880
over to this yeah you can see that the

691
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
client has issued a

692
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,720
an order for the food that part of

693
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,799
example.org identifier

694
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,120
and i've just included illustratively

695
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,960
the client could also optionally include

696
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
um a list of edn's

697
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,320
saying well i can confirm the challenge

698
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,399
against food that bar that example

699
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,279
org i can fulfill a challenge inspiring

700
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,799
example at all but i'm not authorized

701
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,279
with village challenges example.org

702
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,559
now i don't think we need that

703
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,919
flexibility but i'm just asking a

704
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,480
question here

705
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,240
okay and next on the next slide we can

706
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,600
go on to open item number two

707
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,919
and this is just from the server side

708
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,520
does the server need a mechanism to

709
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,039
provide a choice of identifiers

710
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,679
to the client and let the client choose

711
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,760
which challenge to fulfill

712
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,360
and there's some discussion on this on

713
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
the mailer as well we believe that this

714
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,799
is not needed and if this would make the

715
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,840
server state machine and tracking fairly

716
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,960
complicated and it's sufficient for the

717
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,480
clients to be able to signal

718
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,440
to the server whether it's capable of

719
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,320
fulfilling

720
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,519
challenges against parent adns or not

721
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,039
and so the proposal is there's no

722
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,559
provision to do this in the draft and

723
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,919
i've added clarifying statements in the

724
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,880
draft

725
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,600
that if the client indicates that the

726
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
parent domain authorization is true

727
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,440
then server policy controls which

728
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,039
identifier that the server can use to

729
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,440
which we challenge against

730
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,080
but all the client is indicating with

731
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,799
this flag

732
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,960
is that it's up to you now server i've

733
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,399
told you i can authorize against or

734
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,840
fulfill challenges against all of the

735
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,880
domains

736
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
you decide which one you want to issue a

737
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,480
challenge against and that aligns with

738
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,120
the baseline acme spec as well

739
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,559
um next slide please i think they're the

740
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,440
only two open items

741
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,919
yeah there you go there that you want to

742
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,080
open items um the draft has just been

743
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,320
published with those two open items

744
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,159
and closed and documented um

745
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,240
so i'd like to get some feedback on

746
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,080
those two proposals for the open items

747
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
and it is based on what was discussed in

748
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,399
demanders

749
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,519
a couple of months back um and then we'd

750
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:12,399
look for a final

751
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,320
review of draft zero four without any

752
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,840
feedback and i know ross you you

753
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,559
reviewed

754
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,399
version two i believe we've incorporated

755
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,279
all that feedback already

756
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,519
yeah you're in the queue

757
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,240
so um i'm thinking the single bit is not

758
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,480
granular enough because

759
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,279
it in different parts of the dns tree

760
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,039
you don't know

761
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,720
um exactly where to stop so in your

762
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,640
example food.bar.example.org

763
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,000
you're pretty sure that you can't put

764
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,519
the challenge in dot org but

765
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,679
you know in other parts

766
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,279
where especially in cctlds it's not

767
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,360
exactly clear where the

768
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,120
where the top of a particular

769
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,600
registrance control begins

770
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,480
so i think you're you're hey i can deal

771
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,600
with challenges in

772
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,360
in any of these places is safest

773
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
okay

774
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,200
anyone else

775
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,240
yeah this is rich um as an individual

776
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,679
i think we should adopt this as

777
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,120
um a chair uh

778
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,159
i think we should um you know send this

779
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,600
over to dnsop and get their feedback

780
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,510
once we've adopted

781
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:59,519
[Music]

782
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,519
so the obvious question is how many

783
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,960
peoples have read how many people have

784
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,679
read it

785
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,840
and perfectly willing to

786
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:21,839
do the show of hands let's try it

787
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
right

788
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,839
please don't raise your hand if you are

789
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,839
an author

790
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,200
okay this seems to be converging on

791
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,520
about two people

792
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,760
having read it and six people having

793
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,200
explicitly not read it

794
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
okay another one

795
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,160
um so yeah we can do an adoption call

796
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,560
i'd

797
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,400
rather not do it well immediately now

798
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,720
but

799
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,960
uh after we've done the other working

800
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,200
group last calls

801
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
not to burden people with too many

802
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,200
things at the same time

803
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,119
um but yeah i think we can do the

804
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,440
adoption call and then

805
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,839
okay thanks for that okay

806
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,720
so uh so i guess the next step is the

807
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,760
adoption column which means we're almost

808
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,599
done with the agenda and we got to the

809
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,000
open

810
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,800
mic part

811
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
going once

812
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,800
twice okay so

813
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,320
uh you're getting back a lot of your

814
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,800
time and i just want to

815
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
thank rich for all the years of being a

816
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,760
chair of acme

817
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
feel free to like and say thank you

818
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,760
awesome yeah i was going to say thanks

819
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,119
rich i don't know how to flip my camera

820
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,000
everyone's looking at my

821
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
monitor uh for those that might be

822
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
interested in

823
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,240
being a co-chair please do drop me a

824
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,480
note and to me and ben and we can sort

825
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,280
that out

826
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
additionally what would be helpful for

827
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,960
the working group is if we chartered a

828
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
little more specificity into what the

829
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
future work is

830
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,359
uh for example we have a we have some

831
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,960
drafts we're talking about we have some

832
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,880
drafts adopted we don't have necessarily

833
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,000
milestones

834
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,440
i see that there's some drafts that uh

835
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,200
that are related and we don't even have

836
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,720
on the agenda to talk about so if we

837
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,760
just had some dates

838
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,440
for when we think we're going to be done

839
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,520
and we have some notion of when we will

840
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,200
be done and what classes of extensions

841
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:17,839
we want to

842
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,680
we want to cover so it's basically a

843
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,359
matter of do we just need to finish

844
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,280
what we have or is there a new scope

845
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,720
that we expect to be talking about in

846
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,359
the working room

847
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,160
now's a good time to throw that out

848
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,599
metaphorically on the mailing list not
