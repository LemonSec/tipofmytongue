1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,679
convoluted you know

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,880
convoluted aliens i don't know yeah yeah

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,000
i know this they

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,160
you pick a a plot motivator like that

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,840
that can do anything and suddenly the

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,119
the plot really has it's just loses

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,480
structure it just kind of gets out of

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,880
control

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
again that already

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,800
all right we are just a minute after

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,480
right now what's our head count look

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,520
like oh it's actually

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,559
looking really big all right since we

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,160
are tight and i think they probably chop

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
us off they might give us some overlap

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
but we've been chopped in the past

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,840
and we can be long-winded let's get

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,120
rolling

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320

but i'm not in preview mode or uh

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,679
all looks good

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
that was slideshow mode that's the one

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,360

87
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
stage the discussion but it looks like

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,280
the queue so thick we're gonna start

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,720

slideshow

125
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,759

126
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
okay my apologies um again i'm not

127
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
sure i'm not sure uh if this is right or

128
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,240
not

129
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
can you guys hear me yes hello can you

130
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,919

131
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
i hear both of you now let's have one go

132
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
at a time i think that's human right

133
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,520
yes it is okay it's a stick you want to

134
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,240
go first

135
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,680
my apologies i didn't mean to travel

136
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,039
okay so in that case i keep talking i

137
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
think

138
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,560
is the one in the queue uh i'm not sure

139
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,039
about

140
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,280
mld i think that's what the stick was

141
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,759
trying to bring in the

142
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,840
yeah so this is right uh

143
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,880
i don't think that's the right drafter

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
right it's a draft itf

145
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,919
beer pim signaling that is in the

146
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,319
yeah this ieee right this one is uh i

147
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,759
think what she's referring to is an

148
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
actual pim draft knight gmp that's in

149
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
there that

150
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
uh i guess his dependency in the beer

151
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,479
mld

152
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,840
oh okay yes understood okay

153
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,160
uh bls extension we have um

154
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
again we're looking for that to be

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
revved

156
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,520
and php looks like it's last call

157
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,039
and move on it's one that's in the queue

158
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
that we got response from i think we

159
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,759
have a shepherd for

160
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,919
and i just was staging them out so we'll

161
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,440
start pushing those on through as they

162
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,479
go

163
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,160
uh same thing with evpn possibly next

164
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
call

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
and we definitely need shepherds for it

166
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,039
as we move

167
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,400
we're waiting for a shepherd review of

168
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
beer ping um

169
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,319

shepherd

171
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,880
and v3 needs a shepherd now i've asked

172
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,000
for shepherds after each one of the

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
meetings i usually get two or three and

174
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,720
it moves us forward

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,039
so here's my pitch once again i want to

176
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,560
participate you want to get your hands

177
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
dirty involved in the process

178
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
this is a great way to simply follow

179
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,919
instructions

180
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
there's a draft or a rfc that goes

181
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,759
through the process

182
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,759
just to confirm the document has gone

183
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,680
through all the necessary procedures in

184
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,440
the itf working group before it's moved

185
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,879
on to the isdq

186
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,319
and this document then you know it's

187
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
just your document you author

188
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
confirming all those questions and

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
giving any comments on the status of the

190
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,759
doc and that moves forward with the

191
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,479
queue

192
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,479
uh for the all i have to review before

193
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,879
getting uh ratified and published

194
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,639
so please i'll i'll jump on the list

195
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,080
again i'll go through the the

196
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,479
number of docs and which ones some

197
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,919
people just say i'll take anything some

198
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,360
people have some passion i want to grab

199
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,919
one

200
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,000
that's great either way whatever works

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
we'll make it work

202
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,039
so there's my pitch and look for an

203
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
email after this and probably after my

204
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,279
nap and then i'll send some email out

205
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,360
uh greg to thank so um okay i see you're

206
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
putting that up i i'll be presenting

207
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
tomorrow in best

208
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,000
so i will call maybe someone in best

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
because those guys have dpdp and

210
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,519
knowledge will volunteer to shepherd

211
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
actually the evp and extensions because

212
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,519
it's no hugely vpn specific

213
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,760
i don't foresee any surprises but you

214
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,440
know it would be good to maybe get them

215
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
involved you by far this one here at the

216
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,839
top

217
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,519
yeah yeah okay got it all right

218
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,360
idr extension has actually expired kind

219
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,800
of waiting around we need authors to

220
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
update this thing and then we can

221
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
uh again jump on a shepherd and move

222
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
uh looks like lsr extension just needs

223
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,360
an update i don't know what the status

224
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,000
is off the

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,440
digging that to see but they're

226
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,800
definitely uh most likely connected

227
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,720
any other questions dot gaps

228
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
yeah the lsr ether will really need an

229
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
update if the authors don't step up i

230
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,120
think

231
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,640
you know we give it another meeting or

232
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,399
so and then we start to look for another

233
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,920
set of authors to actually direct the

234
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,519
stuff forward we need that yeah

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,120
oh gotcha so the authors that were

236
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,640
actually engaged in it have just kind of

237
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
moved on

238
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,959
i don't know right

239
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,959
we don't get traction we have to move on

240
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
all right fair enough

241
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,120
all right next up on the agenda

242
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,760
this is kind of interesting oh i already

243
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
have it down so it's not going to help

244
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,680
i'll

245
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
bring it here okay

246
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
wait a minute that's the implementation

247
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
and we're going to start actually with

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,880
jeffrey so the docs are not in correct

249
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,000
order but i'll straighten

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,680
that out and that's the beard tether

251
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,200
dock

252
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,240
so beer tether is there

253
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,880
tether is there all right

254
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,079
i lost your screen you may need to

255
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,000
reshare well no i

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,200
have to i closed the dock i was sharing

257
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
and then that kills it not to open the

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,320
next dock

259
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,040
make sure i'm on the right one and i

260
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
will share it

261
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,920
so can you guys hear me okay yes jeffrey

262
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,040
sounds great

263
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
you read fun

264
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,959
all right you see it yes

265
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,399
excellent all right

266
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,640
next slide um yeah

267
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
so um uh

268
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,560
in this zero one version i have uh uh

269
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,079
updates um

270
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,360
uh to add uh my egress protection um

271
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,200
so today i'm just going to give you the

272
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,560
quicker

273
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,000
uh quick review of this uh

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
uh egress egress protection

275
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,079
first a quick overview of a tethering

276
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,839
idea itself

277
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
basically a router that does not

278
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,120
supporting beer which we call a non-bfr

279
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
it may have one or more designated

280
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
helper

281
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
tether to it um typically it's right

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,720
next to it

283
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,920
with a short a fat short pipe

284
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,959
it could be about a tonneau as well the

285
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:01,680
helper

286
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,480
advertises that it is the helper of a

287
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,200
helped

288
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,880
node and helps node its chipman

289
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,120
typically right yeah

290
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,519
and then we uh the section 6.9 procedure

291
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,279
in the architecture

292
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,880
rfc um which is for post

293
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,079
spf handling of non-bfrs

294
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,440
we update that so that

295
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
instead of replacing a non-bfr with its

296
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
children that supports bfr we replace it

297
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,800
with the helper um if we know that

298
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,160
that would not introduce loop um

299
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,800
after that the tunnel will be the

300
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,639
traffic will be tunneled to the helper

301
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,240
who then tunnel to the downstream bfrs

302
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,880
that's the basic idea of tethering and

303
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,560
in the zero line revision

304
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,639
we will introduce egress protection

305
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,680
based using the

306
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,480
tethering algorithm way to do the egress

307
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,440
protection

308
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,839
next slide please

309
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,720
so at the bottom of this screen uh this

310
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,160
slides we have

311
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,560
example a topology um bfer1 and bfbr2

312
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,639
c1 is connected to both bf er1 and bfbr2

313
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
c2 is not only connected to bfbr2

314
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,600
so bf er2 is the

315
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
designated helper for bfer1 or

316
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,760
uh texting a protector for the bfe r1

317
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,680
um now when the bfbr one fails

318
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
in this case it could be either the real

319
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,720
node fail

320
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
failure or just the link the only link

321
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
to it is it's down so in that case

322
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,519
we can actually consider it as a non-bfr

323
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,480
um uh so

324
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,360
and then there ace protector bfer 2 will

325
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,240
be considered

326
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,920
as the helper so

327
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,519
with that we actually don't need

328
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,279
additional signaling besides

329
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
existing tethering signaling the bfier2

330
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
will just announce that it's the helper

331
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
of bfer1 and the other routers will see

332
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,399
that and

333
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,199
they realize that bfer1 itself actually

334
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,399
advertiser it is capable of beer

335
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,880
then they know that okay this this

336
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
helper is for eager

337
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:44,160
protection only next slide please

338
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
did you see that uh yes yeah okay

339
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,839
so here the bfr1 is the point of local

340
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,440
repair

341
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,839
um so typically or in the workings

342
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,160
intuition

343
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,880
bfr1 send the package to um

344
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,040
that has the bid for bfvr1 on was

345
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,839
the bfr1 was in the packet to bf er1

346
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,959
directly and

347
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,320
that is you can see that

348
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,760
at the lower left corner

349
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,519
which has the bift for the bf

350
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,360
r1 in that it has an entry

351
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,800
for bfbr1 that entry has a primary pass

352
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,560
basically it says send it to bfer1

353
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
and the backup pass says that since to

354
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,480
bf er

355
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,040
too i should say tunnel is to be a br2

356
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,279
here

357
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,160
so that backup path is calculated uh

358
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,440
ahead of time

359
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,199
um based on that uh advertising on

360
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,839
from bfer2 saying that it is the helper

361
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,399
of the bfb r1

362
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,720
now when that when bfr1 detects that

363
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,839
the bfo er1 failed

364
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,000
any in-flight traffic that bfr1 receives

365
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
with the bfdr one bfvr one bit on

366
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,040
will be tunneled to the bfe r2

367
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,079
now bfo er

368
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,199
two has its own um beef table

369
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,800
in in that table there is a bfb r1

370
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,160
entry and

371
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,279
for that entry the next hop has a

372
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,920
primary pass and backup pass

373
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,959
the primary pass is to send the packet

374
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,319
to bfr1 here

375
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,000
because when when bfer1 does work we do

376
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,120
want the package uh

377
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,279
go to bfer1 um and through the bfr1

378
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,600
now the backup pass is that um to decap

379
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,839
decapsulate the package and send it to

380
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,400
ce1

381
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,599
that's because that bfbr2 knows that it

382
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,240
is the

383
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,400
designated helper or destiny the

384
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,839
protector

385
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,199
for this egress protection

386
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
next slide please

387
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,439
um it's um

388
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,039
it's worth to note that to notice that

389
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,919
uh

390
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,919
both ce1 and c2 if if they

391
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,880
both need to receive the traffic now

392
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,200
when

393
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,039
when the when there be a a

394
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,320
package is fired fastly routed to to

395
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,919
bfer2

396
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,720
and that if that packet only has bfer1

397
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
bit set

398
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,520
then the the bfdr2

399
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
will only send one ascended to c1

400
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,480
after decapsulated it must not

401
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,400
send the the capacitor packet to ce2

402
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
that's why in this uh

403
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,000
scheme the prr the point of local

404
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,799
repair will not flip the bits

405
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,919
that is they would set for bfer1

406
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,960
you will not flip that b2br2 bit

407
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
and that's what what was done on another

408
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,880
uh

409
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,520
egress protection method

410
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,960
now also um

411
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,400
in the bf er tools now if we

412
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
can we go back to the uh earlier slide

413
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
right here yeah so

414
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,760
in the beer table for bfbr2

415
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,000
um whether it's primary paths or backup

416
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,360
pass i did not draw a forwarding bitmask

417
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,400
there

418
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
um i want to point out that um

419
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,960
for that backup pass which has a

420
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,880
decapsulation um

421
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
action there each bit

422
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,000
fbm must only have one bit set

423
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,360
for the bfbr one itself

424
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,600
um

425
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,520
and that is actually uh the general uh

426
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,000
rule

427
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,480
uh that's any encapsulation and and

428
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,520
branch must only have your own bits

429
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,440
that one particular bit set that um

430
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,160
well i should um i shouldn't say that

431
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,919
it's a general rule that is already

432
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,520
it is explicitly spelled out

433
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,080
but at least that's my understanding

434
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,440
next um next slide please

435
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
two slides or this one yeah just this

436
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,240
one yeah

437
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,919
um the third the third notes here

438
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,840
um actually i i need to go back to the

439
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,120
earlier slide

440
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,719
again um

441
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,520
yes i want to point out here that

442
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,559
notice steps in the table for bfdr2

443
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,679
in the entry for bfbr1 here

444
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,559
the primary path is to go to go through

445
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,880
bfr1

446
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,159
because when the pfvr1 is working

447
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,960
we we may want to go uh go that way

448
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,120
now if somehow bfr1

449
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,400
detects the failure of bfer1 earlier

450
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,200
than bfbr2 does

451
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
then we will have a transient loop here

452
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,840
bfr1 send it to bfer2 and bfbr2

453
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,200
follow the primary path bfbr1 and send

454
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,960
it back to

455
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,960
bfr1 so that transition loop

456
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,440
uh can be avoided if we

457
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
don't use that primary path here uh we

458
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,400
as long as bfbr one gets the package

459
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,520
with the

460
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,640
one bit set then you will always just uh

461
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,200
do the decapsulation and send it to the

462
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,960
uh

463
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,440
downstream uh receivers in the over in

464
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,280
the overlay

465
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,799
um that's to avoid that

466
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
that's to avoid that transition loop um

467
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,120
i think that's basically the my

468
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
presentation here

469
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,960
um it's just updates uh to include the

470
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,840
egress protection

471
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,600
comments

472
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,799
all right thanks jeffrey no there are

473
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:53,679
comments why mo

474
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,760
please on the mic got him okay thank you

475
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,360
can you hear me

476
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,640
yes yes yes yeah i have some

477
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,320
questions so uh last year we post the

478
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,039
equal equals protection draft as an

479
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,360
individual draft

480
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,520
under this draft so

481
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,000
jeffrey proposed a new protection

482
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
eagle production so this new proposal

483
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,520
is added into a working group and

484
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
document

485
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,159
so it claims that either we use the

486
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,039
helper

487
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,760
but the organ group document that define

488
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
the helper

489
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,280
the helper is different from the

490
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,840
protector right

491
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,440
so in the eagles protection

492
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,559
so the help in fact is the protector so

493
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,280
it's a different

494
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,520
concept it is just

495
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,559
easy is better to explicitly use

496
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,880
different time for example use protector

497
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,320
whatever

498
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,039
because if you use a helper is something

499
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,280
is confusing

500
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,320
well if you need a helper it's a

501
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,000
good solution if you don't need the

502
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,840
helper i mean you are presenting your

503
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,520
stuff today right which is the direct

504
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,280
ingress protection so both has

505
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,120
merit and we should talk about both

506
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,799
so yeah this isn't that because it is

507
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,400
this new proposal

508
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,080
is about equals production is a

509
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,200
different topic so yes

510
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,799
i think this should be removed

511
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,159
and then placing as separate individual

512
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,600
draft right

513
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,720
because this view purpose even this

514
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
technically technically this new

515
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,159
proposal have

516
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,360
some issues so i will submit those

517
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
issues in at least i would because i

518
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
don't have time enough time to discuss

519
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,720
those

520
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
those are issues even though

521
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,279
so so my main question is that should

522
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,880
we should the author remove

523
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,679
that eagles protection part from a

524
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,080
working group document and then place

525
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,919
it in to a separate individual draft

526
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,799
your point is very criminal and i think

527
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,640
if we could actually find a common

528
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,480
framework to have one single document

529
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,919
with all the ideas for the euros

530
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:22,960
protection

531
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,799
and then work on that that will be the

532
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,080
best outcome

533
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,600
so we don't have multiple documents

534
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
flying for special cases

535
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,799
yeah definitely if we're talking about

536
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,480
capability messages right we'd like

537
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,080
something consistent if possible

538
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,640
um and consistency as well in terms of

539
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,799
where the network are being protected so

540
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,679
we have a a integrated set of tools

541
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,640
instead of an overlapping set of tools

542
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,080
um so procedure wise if we

543
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,640
uh want to separate this out to an

544
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,760
individual draft or

545
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,360
merge with another draft uh

546
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,000
procedure-wise i am fine

547
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,480
but i do want to point out this

548
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,440
is very well integrated with the uh uh

549
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
with the um

550
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,039
tethering solution because uh in the

551
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,240
tethering solution

552
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,000
a helper which is uh beer capable

553
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,919
uh that helps a non-vfr

554
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,320
and when it is used in the egress

555
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,520
protection

556
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,240
the helper becomes a protector and it

557
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,440
protects the

558
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,840
uh the protected uh

559
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
bfer and in fact

560
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,480
uh when we did uh uh we determine when

561
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,880
to

562
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,159
time to tana or not to tunnel that

563
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,679
is basically treating as

564
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,720
uh as if that's uh that helps

565
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,919
uh the protected bfvr is

566
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,120
bfr is beer incapable um

567
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,520
as a non-bfr that's how we decide when

568
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,919
to tunnel when not a tunnel

569
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,039
so it is indeed extending

570
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,120
and the beer tethering procedure

571
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,559
to the egress protection so from

572
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,400
that point of view i don't think we

573
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,360
need or want to separate it out but

574
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,559
that's just my view and i'm

575
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,159
if the working would decide that they

576
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,159
should be separated out

577
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,640
first and we can have more discussion on

578
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,240
the email yes correct i think we should

579
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,880
thank you

580
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
but i think who i know makes a good

581
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,799
point egress protection being basically

582
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,679
its own working

583
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,440
item for all the different cases as one

584
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,279
document may be actually a very good

585
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,840
idea

586
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,400
yep all right sticky the list

587
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,360
good feedback thank you

588
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,080
note taking is running with us we up to

589
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,679
date

590
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,640
jeffrey because you were presenting so

591
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,480
please catch up on this all those notes

592
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,679
thanks

593
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,919
oh um yeah so uh i i didn't realize i

594
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,039
i i i i suppose

595
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,200
the one reason i i'm going first today

596
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,919
is because i need to take off early

597
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,320
oh yeah

598
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,039
all right so can you find another

599
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,240
notetaker put it in your lap

600
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,000
who can jump up here jeffrey's got to

601
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,600
take off is why it went early

602
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,360
um someone

603
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
i think meat echo needs a new app where

604
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,480
we randomly select

605
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
a participant and they become the

606
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
notetaker yeah

607
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,880
dice throw throwing ice yes uh

608
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,240
gentlemen we need no taking

609
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,880
this is you know refusing to perform

610
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,679
okay greg

611

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,720
prepared

613
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,840

635
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,679
my mind

636
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,799
and i'm going to give implementation

637
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,000
wow all right

638
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,960
who's the presenter on the

641
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,919

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,840
thank you so

658
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
let's start and thank you for for

659
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,240
letting us present our um

660
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
for our letting us the chance to present

661
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,760
our work here

662
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,000
um

663
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,520
the presentation is quite it's quite

664
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,120
simple it represents you

665
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,919
there are free router br implementation

666
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
we did so far

667
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,600
since 2017. so

668
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,720
the good news is that we have a this

669
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,840
beer implementation

670
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,320
on free data plane and i'm not sure if

671
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,399
you are familiar with p4 but

672
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,720
we are using p4v and v2 virtual switch

673
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,840
data plane

674
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,039
in order to to to learn to to do our

675
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
homework and then we transpose the work

676
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,000
all to all the whole work we did with

677
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,120
the tofino

678
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,799
switch uh which which came from um

679
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,399
initially barefoot now called intel uh

680
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,399
and we also progress with zpdk that are

681
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,600
playing so we are

682
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,240
i will be co-presenting this this this

683
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,440
20 minutes with

684
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
shabba mate which is the rata lead car

685
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,799
developer

686
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,000
and i'm just the the the r project uh

687
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,880
working for

688
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,240
for about kimball forgero on behalf of

689
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,559
and i'm the technical leader of the the

690
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,600
project

691
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,120
so a real brief agenda we

692
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,159
really quickly present um the project uh

693
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,279
brsc draft implementation and the the

694
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,080
experience

695
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,399
the experience the br implementation

696
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,840
experience we

697
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,279
we we lived since 2017

698
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,480
um a little a word about interworking

699
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,320
and one focus on loop enrolling

700
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,159
uh topic with a beer application

701
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,159
and a very small conclusion so um

702
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,640
the haar project r stands for router for

703
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
academia research and education and

704
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,240
started in 2019

705
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,880
and the group request was to simply try

706
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,159
to couple

707
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,159
a control plane with a multiple data

708
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,440
plane and uh

709
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,799
by and by interfacing the two uh we

710
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,559
can have a fully functional uh router

711
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,640
working at different data plane rate

712
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,200
but basically it will leverage the the

713
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,919
hardware

714
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,720
capacity in order to provide some

715
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,159
interesting

716
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,039
some feature that are that that are

717
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,919
specialized

718
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,200
per use case so the idea is to re

719
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,480
the the real idea behind a rare free

720
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,120
router

721
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,559
is that it's a one familiar platform

722
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,960
that can be used to create multiple

723
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,159
solutions and each solution will address

724
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,279
multiple use cases in the research and

725
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,080
education

726
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,000
of course it's not only about research

727
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,279
education it can also

728
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,399
fit your own use case as soon as it is

729
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,600
compatible

730
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,679
when i'm talking about use case it's

731
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,360
simply uh because

732
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,679
um we are using one control plane but

733
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,120
multiple data planes

734
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
and depending the use case you would

735
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,320
like to address

736
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,799
the data plane will be different whether

737
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,159
you would like to have a

738
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,799
to use a pure label switch router level

739
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,679
switch router

740
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,840
as a p router with mpls you will

741
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,039
go use a hardware that is able to switch

742
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,799
that is capable to switch one hand at

743
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,720
one at a terabyte

744
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,919
terabits sorry traffic rate

745
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,240
but if you are using a small office home

746
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,720
office router you will enjoy

747
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,159
the the data the gpdk data plan flavor

748
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,919
that we can provide

749
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,080
um so um in this in this situation we

750
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,440
we have recently the team has recently

751
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,080
implemented

752
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,080
beer and beer and this is the the

753
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,360
what we plan to present you uh today

754
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,279
so not too uh not just to give you some

755
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,240
idea about what we we did with the the

756
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
the

757
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,720
the doppler plane we support now is p rp

758
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,640
for uh vmv2 uh tofino switch

759
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,880
we are studying the possibility also to

760
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,679
to run

761
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,200
our code on fpgas we have a

762
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,639
p formulation already

763
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,879
in in in the in our git

764
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,239
lab and this

765
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,320
emulation target are implemented using

766
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,399
the picap and dpdk

767
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,399
we are in the discussion we brought

768
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,079
chrome in our directory to see

769
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,199
how we can leverage npl

770
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,960
to to to apply our code to a hardware

771
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,760
like

772
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,320
trial and for and jericho ii

773
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,879
we are very this is the the p4 lab we

774
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,679
are running

775
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,199
uh in europe uh since yesterday we

776
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,119
are connected to uh chicago

777
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,679
in the us and from there you have we

778
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,399
have already

779
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,399
we have the possibility to reach the

780
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,960
whole research and education

781
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,160
u.s area

782
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,280
so we are working with 10 tech tennessee

783
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,640
university uh northern

784
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,839
university and caltech also in order to

785
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,119
to provide to provide this uh live

786
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,320
live p4 lab

787
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,359
we are using this lab to uh to test

788
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,400
uh the beer implementation where for

789
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,040
example

790
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,200
some nodes are hosting some bare metal

791
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,119
server that produce a

792
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,480
source multicast source

793
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,760
sorry and uh we are we we can also pre

794
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,119
prevent um we can also connect a

795
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:37,839
receiver

796
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,000
on top of this um visa green box

797
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,240
you have a question you just mentioned

798
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,200
chicago

799
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
um that's star tap right is it still

800
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,400
called star tap

801
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,720
starlight starlight now but that's

802
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,520
that's the uh

803
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,920
like university research education

804
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,359
peering point

805
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,359
yes exactly yes okay excellent so

806
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,200
actually you've accessed the entire i2

807
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,000
infrastructure

808
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,880
but those are the universes that

809
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,160
collectively working actually

810
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,800
exactly this is the this is the idea

811
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,520
please go ahead and

812
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,800
nothing forget about the yes sorry my

813
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,200
bad

814
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,720
my slides so yes

815
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,079
the bigger implementation we have is

816
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,560
at the moment focusing on the mpls and

817
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,760
observation

818
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,560
i i know about the others but currently

819
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,640
as far as i know

820
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,400
at least for us the mpls encompassion is

821
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,680
the target

822
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,280
and this is what uh free router have

823
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,599
since beer became rfc

824
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,480
uh in software that plane that is when

825
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,280
free router

826
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,560
itself handles all the packets itself

827
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,000
in in the java control plane and

828
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,280
and do the the um

829
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,640
the forwarding itself uh this data plane

830
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,839
supports uh

831
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,119
all the b strings uh written in the in

832
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,320
the beer and

833
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,440
mpls cerasi and moreover

834
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,720
it supports uh the

835
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,000
the b string domain so i mean

836
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,800
when you have two uh two gear domains uh

837
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,599
one running

838
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,960
on on a on the b string lengths uh a

839
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,079
and other on the b string ranks b

840
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,520
and the domain border router

841
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,800
have two igps and and and have to

842
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,880
uh deconstruct and if it goes from the

843
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,240
bigger to the lower

844
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,079
missing length then it have to emit two

845
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,320
pockets with two different

846
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,760
s eyes on on the lower side

847
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,359
and and the same on the backward

848
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,960
direction but obviously it won't

849
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
duplicate the packets

850
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,839
this is in software in hardware we only

851
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,079
support recommended b strings ranks

852
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,800
in order data planes we do that list

853
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
dpdk at

854
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,800
oceanogram and fully for educational b

855
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,560
bmv too

856
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,119
regarding the the control plan features

857
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:07,839
we

858
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,880
have also from the beginning

859
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,720
is the isis implementation it

860
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,440
it has no inter interoperability tests

861
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
at the moment

862
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,480
but via shrek nowadays decodes uh isis

863
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,240
lsps with bigger extensions very well so

864
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,119
uh i am pretty sure that if one of you

865
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:29,440
have

866
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,079
something then it would be interesting

867
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:32,960
to see how it

868
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,119
interworks uh regarding west pf

869
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,400
um we already had an interrupt

870
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,040
interoperability testing which went

871
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,920
quite well and

872
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,680
thanks guys tony and uh sorry i cannot

873
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,200
pronounce the name

874
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,760
but i had to so thanks to ripper guys

875
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,400
for for uh letting this happen

876
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,599
i mean the ospf interrupt regarding the

877
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,040
idea i mean bgp with

878
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,760
with the beer attributes attached to a

879
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,640
prefix

880
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,599
from a different domain or from the same

881
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,240
i mean

882
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,359
as or the same as uh we

883
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,079
already have it obviously the the

884
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,520
attribute type is

885
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,920
is a has random value from the reserved

886
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,720
part

887
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,920
but uh the

888
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,680
population of the data plane and the

889
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,079
computation is already there so when the

890
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,000
two bids get populated uh it will be the

891
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,960
final version from our side and more

892
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,839
interestingly uh

893
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,680
so our primary target is to provide uh

894
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,079
an iptv like experiment

895
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,440
in the field finally in our enron in

896
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,160
hungary

897
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,920
so we went for basically for the

898
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,599
pim beer draft that is

899
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,000
i'm not only concentrating on beer

900
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,880
because uh

901
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,480
we will go with the with the cps but

902
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,760
they will be ps in this case so

903
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,800
obviously i test with pin but but also

904
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,599
the same

905
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,440
is true from this from this point uh

906
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,160
when i mentioned beam it is the same for

907
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
for igmp that is uh

908
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,880
from freewriter's point of view it's

909
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,319
unimportant if the

910
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,440
join or or the report came from pmore

911
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,800
igmp

912
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,920
frederick excited please

913
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,920
frederick next site please thanks expire

914
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,319
and

915
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,400
experiment so uh two quick questions

916
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,400
um louie um two quick questions so one

917
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,520
uh pausing i assume he you are attaching

918
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,839
poland to psnc right

919
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,440
yes a super and all the

920
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,240
p4 routers and jams are now running beer

921
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
actually your implementation

922
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,599
um yes

923
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,720
so the thing is that we will

924
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,440
came out soon with uh with the public

925
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,520
only order image

926
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,040
and the data plane torsional binary that

927
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,200
basically did the forwarding code of the

928
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,240
asic is

929
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,920
is just a 50 kilobyte debian package

930
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,560
that you can

931
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,200
that you can field replace uh not

932
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,359
everything is packed to the same

933
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,280
i mean not every feature is packed to

934
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,720
the same

935
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,680
only image because we have too many

936
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,560
features to fit

937
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,640
the asic so so you have to to

938
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,880
to choose between the between the

939
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,560
features but uh but

940
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,480
we already built the uh beer feature set

941
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,160
that is uh an mpls features that choose

942
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,680
the beer forwarding and the igmp and the

943
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,000
and the pim interworking from the data

944
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,119
plane part

945
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,680
uh the software i mean the control plane

946
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,200
part is animated so

947
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,760
it is the same free router regardless

948
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,000
which data plane you are using

949
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,319
okay yeah super so that is a call to all

950
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,920
the vendors here on this call

951
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,839
this may be the next interrupt lab for

952
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,440
where you can cheaply interrupt beer

953
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,960
with a lot of different stuff

954
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,480
excellent i think we lost the screen

955
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
share greg uh

956
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,160
answering to your question explicitly

957
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,480
yes we have we have a specific side

958
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,720
where i would like to ask what vendors

959
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,480
here that please please uh

960
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,680
find us or or let us find you and let's

961
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,359
do the interrupt

962
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,680
okay i granted the screen again yeah so

963
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,280
let's continue

964
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,079
time is precious

965
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,640
okay so basically how how it could

966
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,200
happen

967
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,839
um when when you came out with with the

968
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,160
draft i started to study it and i

969
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,760
started to implement it on my home

970
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,480
network

971
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,960
all the underlying words and links are

972
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,599
clicked

973
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,680
here you will see that it is it is a

974
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,839
small home network but

975
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,599
about 10 or more routing nodes and all

976
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,359
have virtual routers within in in some

977
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,240
basically a 30 to 50 nodes depending on

978
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,520
which day is it

979
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,680
on the week basically and but it's an es

980
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,880
esp like set up here that is i run to

981
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,800
two route reflectors and

982
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,000
and these uh mpls vpns both layer 2 and

983
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,359
layer 3 and

984
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,440
so on so so people with a very small one

985
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,200
uh in in a in a small household

986
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,560
and uh obviously have my own needs like

987
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,119
uh to

988
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,160
to have a two zone uh music here and

989
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,440
it quickly turned out that only perfect

990
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,160
solution

991
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,560
uh on over internet is is a real

992
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,640
broadcast so i started studying

993
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,440
initially

994
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,720
mldp sorry initially pinned an mldp

995
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,920
and nowadays beer obviously when when

996
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,400
when i

997
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,560
didn't had a data plane i run it in

998
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,079
software switching and

999
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,760
i and i saw uh my cpus matting but

1000
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,400
now they with the with the dpdk it's

1001
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,240
gone

1002
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,119
free next night please i don't know

1003
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,800
please don't uh please are back

1004
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,920
please back and yes uh

1005
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,240
thanks again for the juniper guys who

1006
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,200
let it happen

1007
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,800
uh recently we had a real the first real

1008
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,200
interrupt test over ospf

1009
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,599
and i think it was just my bad that i

1010
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,359
didn't proceed

1011
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,319
toward the thing is that it really

1012
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,599
interworked

1013
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,200
i i you will see hopefully in the next

1014
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,079
slides

1015
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,800
i've got an access to to an intermediate

1016
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,680
image

1017
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,040
i i had some screen shots from it

1018
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,720
um the the i tanks

1019
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,599
it is it is not one but but but uh

1020
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,560
somewhere else about it

1021
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,880
uh it is it is a test uh it is a test

1022
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,920
but uh if you heard about

1023
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,240
dm42.net it is um it is a community

1024
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,280
uh it is a community movement to let

1025
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,960
young people experiment with bgp and

1026
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,560
i joined it so early and uh the thing is

1027
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,280
that

1028
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,560
anyone can peer to anybody over here and

1029
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,240
my own public df-42

1030
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,240
test bed got an a beer

1031
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,359
draft idea that is a bgp

1032
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,160
uh so what uh got this feature about uh

1033
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,000
two years ago when i implemented

1034
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,680
the the bgp part for the for the beer

1035
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,400
since then anybody who who joins the

1036
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,440
tr-42

1037
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,160
on on my notes or or pierce to be over a

1038
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,400
gre or anything it's public

1039
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,800
and and anonymous you can you can

1040
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,480
interrupt test

1041
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,920
basically zero to 24 hours for reckoning

1042
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,560
snipers

1043
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,480
and yes it is the first screenshot

1044
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,880
of the juniper interrupt test on the

1045
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,760
upper half

1046
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,640
and please can uh can repair guys unmute

1047
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,359
you

1048
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,440
probably you will have better better

1049
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,119
comments than me

1050
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,480
so the upper half on the screen you can

1051
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,839
see how

1052
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,520
how the vmx decoded

1053
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,440
decoded the ospf lsas that i

1054
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,800
i sent to him basically the vmix as you

1055
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,359
can see on the bottom of the screen

1056
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,880
was surrounded by by two free router

1057
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,240
vrfs in this case from the left and from

1058
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,880
the right

1059
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,400
i will i will name that

1060
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,960
i record them in this name on the

1061
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,680
proceedings

1062
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,960
frederick next night please

1063
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,079
uh so the

1064
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,200
beer forwarding table uh from the julia

1065
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,079
burst point of

1066
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,359
view remember the left and right

1067
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,359
were on the g001 and g002

1068
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,960
and from the left which is the one

1069
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,910
and the vmix here the 222.111

1070
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:09,280
[Music]

1071
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,920
and uh it picked up the prefixes

1072
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,720
perfectly

1073
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,680
immediately without any hacking on it

1074
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
and on the next slide

1075
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,640
you can see that the bf id

1076
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,280
embedded i mean attached to the

1077
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,400
preferred please back

1078
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,520
okay no okay okay perfect so

1079
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,920
uh on on the bottom of the screen you

1080
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,760
can see that how via mix

1081
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,800
attached bfr ids

1082
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,319
from the prefixes

1083
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,920
to the next hops basically but uh

1084
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,760
yes i think it is it is attached to the

1085
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,599
next host from my from

1086
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,960
free router's terminology but uh i think

1087
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,200
juniper have a different terminology for

1088
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,480
it

1089
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,119
never mind and the other thing you note

1090
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:57,839
that

1091
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:00,319
my implementation advertises random

1092
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,160
labels every time and juniper

1093
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,280
picked it perfectly from the start

1094
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,839
and every time i reloaded my side it

1095
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,800
worked fine and

1096
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,599
repopulated the tables and on the middle

1097
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,359
of the screen the one two three

1098
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,000
the slash 60 is the juniper's own

1099
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,240
loopback address in this domain

1100
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,000
obviously he didn't allocate it for uh

1101
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,800
himself a low back label or i don't know

1102
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,920
how to cut it

1103
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,680
for a week next year next night please

1104
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,359
yes detailing the the forwarding i mean

1105
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,599
the beer forwarding table with the next

1106
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,400
hopes from the juniper's point of view

1107
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,200
um this is the b string on the wire

1108
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,960
basically dumped you in

1109
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,839
binary it is a very very useful thing

1110
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,240
because when you open the packet capture

1111
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,359
uh and you convert back the binary to

1112
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,440
eggs it is the same what you can

1113
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,359
see in the after the beer

1114
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,640
header i mean in the baseline part

1115
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,839
and again the next hope associated to it

1116
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,920
and the outgoing interface

1117
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,040
feel like next time please

1118
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,440
this screenshot is my buggy sorry

1119
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,079
so the ospf from the left and the last

1120
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,680
pair from the right

1121
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,880
um basically nothing interesting

1122
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,720
i uh i used the 1.11.2

1123
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,200
i enabled beer on the area and the

1124
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,559
traffic engineering

1125
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,079
i'm not sure if if julia checks for it

1126
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,280
or or not

1127
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,559
i nobody just for sure because

1128
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,160
because i actually didn't want to check

1129
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,800
for

1130
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,160
it later i i did anyway it's just

1131
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,280
when the screenshot was taken yes and

1132
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,960
look back from the left of the juniper

1133
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,240
and how i attached the beer index to

1134
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,599
that

1135
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,599
graphics felix next type is

1136
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,720
federic next like this and yes

1137
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,079
it is uh it is with the with the set the

1138
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,880
filter from the juniper's right side but

1139
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:17,359
still

1140
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,240
from free router basically what you can

1141
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,200
spot here

1142
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,559
is uh is two channels uh it's it's a

1143
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,200
free radar specific thing to be able to

1144
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,480
quickly test

1145
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,400
the idea here is the same when

1146
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,800
similar when what what you think what

1147
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,599
you do

1148
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,520
when it comes to point to multi-point or

1149
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,960
svpt and

1150
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,960
basically you set a dummy destination

1151
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,720
with the free router international don't

1152
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,599
care about it

1153
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,839
but on the domain name part you can list

1154
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:46,640
more

1155
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,960
eyepiece and freerupter will go for the

1156
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,920
bf

1157
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,119
ids and populate the header with with

1158
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:53,440
them

1159
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,839
i mean the bits set with them so

1160
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:56,640
basically i

1161
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,680
i can do

1162
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,640
a static multicast threading if i want

1163
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,520
in this way

1164
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,920
it is it is here for just for this or

1165
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,960
two testing

1166
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,800
in this case with the beer junipero

1167
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,119
interoperability

1168
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,599
i only set one bit from the juniper's

1169
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,599
left and right and i assigned an

1170
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,800
unicos type as you can see 3c3

1171
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,760
and for the next trip please

1172
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,319
and basically i did nothing but pink

1173
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,200
through

1174
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,720
no it's it's not the slide so uh it's

1175
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,440
this slide is about uh how free wrather

1176
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,559
saw from

1177
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,559
juniper advertisement from left and

1178
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,839
right and more

1179
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,760
interestingly on the left and right

1180
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,680
i heard clearly the other side i mean

1181
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,960
on the left side i i can see 2 2 2 that

1182
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,880
one two three which is truly pairs on uh

1183
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,960
loopback address and the advertised

1184
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,720
table one two three which i configured

1185
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,599
to it

1186
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,119
and uh which which i wanted to see here

1187
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,800
is the two two two that two two two

1188
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,240
which is the juniper's

1189
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,839
right side so juniper advertised

1190
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:11,839
i mean flooded the lsa's through itself

1191
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:14,160
to the left which is which is basically

1192
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,359
normal but

1193
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,720
i i wanted to see it and finally the

1194
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,800
forwarding table from free router's

1195
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,200
point of view on left and right uh

1196
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,400
vrs uh no unfortunately i added the

1197
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,960
mystic and the left the visual vf

1198
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,520
for the next site please

1199
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,720
yes so how a specific label looks like

1200
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,559
in freewater's point of view basically

1201
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,599
is the same what

1202
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,000
what you what you have so already on on

1203
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,280
the beers uh

1204
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,720
now on jupiter's beer forwarding table

1205
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,440
when

1206
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,520
juniper populated its uh its b string

1207
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,079
and uh us assigned it to an s op and an

1208
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:56,000
interface and so on but it's from the

1209
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,520
free routers

1210
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,559
i think it's from the left but i can

1211
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,079
spot it right now

1212
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,559
yes it's from the left it's in the four

1213
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,319
bar the left

1214
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,400
column four frederick next slide please

1215
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,559
yes then i cleared the counters and sent

1216
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,480
some pockets through

1217
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,680
and then i checked the counters juniper

1218
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,160
was connected i mean juniper's

1219
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,880
[Music]

1220
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,680
g001g002

1221
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,040
was connected to pv at l1 and 2

1222
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,160
and the thing is that i sent 70

1223
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,000
kilobytes and i received

1224
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,079
70 kilobytes and the backward direction

1225
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,760
is the same that is i i saw no a single

1226
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,160
bit

1227
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,160
uh additional deletion from the pocket

1228
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,000
that is the forwarding happened

1229
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,920
perfectly from my point of view later

1230
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,359
obviously i did some

1231
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,760
other testing and then captures on the

1232
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,040
interface and

1233
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,240
i spot nothing really nothing

1234
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,439
floric next time please

1235
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,000
yes so finally the last sign

1236
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,880
the last light from my part is uh it's a

1237
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,520
bit

1238
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,640
uh a bit of uh poor man's uh

1239
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,680
poor man's beer forwarding because uh we

1240
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,559
went uh

1241
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,680
now with uh with p for data plane

1242
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,680
and here i had two decision

1243
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,480
to be honest i didn't like uh nor of

1244
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,319
them

1245
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:33,359
the the fourth decision from my point of

1246
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:34,319
view

1247
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,359
if i make the the real ending

1248
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,240
of the b string with the calculated uh

1249
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,520
with the calculated

1250
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,119
b string then i send out the pocket if

1251
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,319
any bit remained one and i

1252
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,000
i do a note end on the pocket and

1253
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,119
recirculate

1254
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:56,240
the pocket if any bit remained one

1255
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,280
but this thing uh would you

1256
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,880
like a rest circulation which

1257
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,799
if i had to recirculate to three piers

1258
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,040
i i mean if i had to recirculate three

1259
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,000
times for

1260
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,440
three very different peers then it would

1261
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,720
divide the the beer performance instead

1262
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,920
of this i decided to unroll that

1263
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,559
forwarding group for the asic

1264
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,960
because this extra calculation in the

1265
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,559
spf

1266
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,559
i was able to use the built-in flooding

1267
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,200
mechanism of the p4 language which is

1268
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,599
basically optimized for their to

1269
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,960
flooding and the thing what i

1270
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,400
described here is basically this

1271
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,240
i don't want to explain two more

1272
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,880
or only if you are very interested in it

1273
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,079
the thing is that

1274
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,880
i think you will see some run basics in

1275
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,160
the future

1276
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,920
that uh would uh decide if they go with

1277
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:00,400
the r

1278
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,240
welding or or circulation

1279
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,720
if you have any clever mathematics over

1280
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,839
there

1281
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,040
i would like to see a draft and the

1282
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,520
proof

1283
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,599
that how can this rolling be

1284
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,760
done well i mean i tried uh

1285
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,640
some things and finally i have now an

1286
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,880
idea that uh

1287
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,920
that if i if i fully disable

1288
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,280
uh equals multi-passing uh

1289
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,480
calculations for beer i mean uh the the

1290
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,040
prefixes that have a bfr id

1291
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,720
and i need to do the b the beer

1292
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,400
calculation because the operator

1293
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,040
neighborhood

1294
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,680
etcetera etcetera and then i do a second

1295
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,000
calculation we don't need uh

1296
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,240
only the first uh possibilities

1297
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,359
populated and

1298
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,240
and with this uh solution which is far

1299
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,559
from

1300
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,920
perfect obviously i reached

1301
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,119
the state that uh the last hope

1302
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,119
do the pocket division i mean

1303
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,319
in this case i i usually saw

1304
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,319
erwan doing replication and the two

1305
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,760
replicas proceeded

1306
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,160
on air 1 r2 f4 and r1 s3 r5

1307
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,720
with with the tricks i tried finally i

1308
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,240
reached the point that

1309
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,040
r1 does not duplicate duplicate the

1310
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:23,920
pocket

1311
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,280
but it basically four bars with f2

1312
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,400
with two bits set and air to uh

1313
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,960
basically duplicates the pockets to air

1314
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,880
four and there five

1315
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,760
but uh it's it's again a poor man's

1316
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,880
solution

1317
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,319
for uh just to to

1318
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:46,640
overcame the the forwarding limitations

1319
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,319
yes question um

1320
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,799
yeah yeah tony i think we had a chat you

1321
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:53,359
know

1322
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,599
uh uh out of band on private email about

1323
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:56,720
the whole thing

1324
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,200
um there's a lot of traders right the

1325
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,880
beer forwarding pad allows you to

1326
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,799
paralyze or recirculate or whatever

1327
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:03,920
there's a lot of implementation

1328
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,920
depending you know what you optimize for

1329
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,400
cost

1330
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,680
speed uh fan out you can do all kind of

1331
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,480
trade-offs

1332
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,760
for the ecmp um i mean i'm not

1333
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,839
saying too much but architecturally what

1334
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,680
we did we really have an

1335
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,839
igp next stop or whatever provides the

1336
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:20,880
next stop underneath

1337
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,760
beer so we do not try to do the next

1338
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,440
pcmp in beer we actually

1339
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,359
fall back on the igp next stop and you

1340
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,280
see that also when you look at our rips

1341
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,480
in the cli

1342
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,960
that we really use igp we use protection

1343
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,280
we use ecmp and so on architecturally

1344
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,280
but also of course it's an indirection

1345
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,880
that you have to provide

1346
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,960
and yes yes you are absolutely right

1347
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,160
and this problem

1348
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,799
i think can can can be uh

1349
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:54,079
can can cannot put without ac ecmp

1350
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,280
easily

1351
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,960
i personally spot it on an ecmp

1352
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,760
topology and that's why i came up with

1353
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,640
this side

1354
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,520
and this drawing because that's what i i

1355
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,079
use

1356
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,880
in my home network basically that i have

1357
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,599
two p

1358
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,799
p routers and two p routers attached to

1359
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,480
the loudspeakers

1360
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,680
uh i agree with that

1361
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,160
the the forwarding solution we are using

1362
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,599
uh can result

1363
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,160
sub-optimal uh duplication points

1364
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,319
without ac mpl so

1365
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,920
uh it's it's absolutely true but uh

1366
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,240
from my point of view what i am planning

1367
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,119
to

1368
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,640
i mean the the forwarding

1369
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,920
ac code is tuned to at the moment

1370
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,040
is to avoid

1371
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,720
as much as possible recirculation

1372
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,280
and it's and it's and it's true so we

1373
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,760
really

1374
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,400
do not recirculate for beer replication

1375
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,200
but

1376
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,160
then i had to add all that's it yeah of

1377
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:56,559
course

1378
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,640
yes i mean recirculation we both know is

1379
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,720
very very costly ac wise but you know

1380
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,559
it's also very costly

1381
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,559
to carry a lot of packet descriptors to

1382
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,839
the chip so

1383
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,119
no free lunch yes yes yes absolutely

1384
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,520
absolutely absolutely

1385
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,559
and the only thing that

1386
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,680
i am aware of and we need to document

1387
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,200
with this thing is uh

1388
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,319
here in my test bed i i run it over

1389
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,520
uh so basically old nodes

1390
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,640
have a four or five or eight maximum

1391
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,040
gigabit connections to a common layer

1392
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,000
two and uh

1393
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,440
the routing nodes here are uh

1394
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,040
rooted on the stick configuration and

1395
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,240
in uh when it comes to the hardware

1396
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,359
and then i have to replicate

1397
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,040
two pockets to the same uh port

1398
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,160
then it obviously will overload it so

1399
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,040
that's that's the only thing we spotted

1400
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,359
but

1401
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,839
since then we had the threat we have the

1402
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:00,640
chance to

1403
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,500
to to measure it i mean

1404
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,319
[Music]

1405
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,440
not fully because we have some we have

1406
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,319
some limitations with the visual

1407
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:14,880
and so on but i saw it performing at 50

1408
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,599
gigabits already

1409
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,960
which is not bad after a while

1410
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,359
well europe is living now in beer

1411
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,359
because the first hard rock music has

1412
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,760
been piped over beer network in europe

1413
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,160
excellent congratulations thanks

1414
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:39,839
please continue

1415
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:44,720
frederick we don't hear you

1416
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,160
sorry can you hear me now yes yes sorry

1417
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,790
uh key takeover slide uh

1418
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,640
[Music]

1419
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,440
well everything everyone is is doing it

1420
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,000
but

1421
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,160
we just wanted to to to mention that we

1422
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,280
are also

1423
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,000
automating all the testing related to

1424
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,799
all the features

1425
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,480
and beer is included uh you can fill the

1426
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,559
the whole list of tests in the project

1427
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,480
page um

1428
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,039
essentially it's roughly 2000 tests that

1429
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,240
are a daily

1430
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,640
uh no not daily but automatically

1431
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,160
triggered each time

1432
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,119
the new code is committed into the the

1433
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,880
git

1434
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,319
in the end uh you have a freshly image

1435
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,760
like a junos install or

1436
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,559
cisco or whatever firmware install and

1437
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,400
wineline installer that will let you

1438
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,720
handle the network that lets you

1439
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,400
transform your

1440
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,039
p4 router or your p4 switch into a

1441
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,200
full-fledged router having

1442
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,839
instruments

1443
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:54,559
see almost and uh

1444
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,079
one thing that is important is that we

1445
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,599
have a prior aspirant

1446
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,039
that help us to where you are using rfc

1447
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,640
conformance test

1448
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,039
next step is to provide profile p for

1449
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:06,720
profile calibration that

1450
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,200
example mentioned which means that each

1451
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,200
image will have a profile

1452
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,160
one maybe may will be dedicated to a

1453
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:14,880
beer

1454
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,960
one can be pure mpls the other one can

1455
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,319
be srv6

1456
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,559
only uh and um

1457
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,160
dpd we have a p4dpdk uh that applies

1458
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,920
that is in operation they are already

1459
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,440
used in in spain

1460
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,480
and by university of murcia and soon

1461
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,960
university there'll be paris basketballs

1462
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,680
in in bilbao

1463
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,000
and we would love to to have your

1464
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,200
feedback if some

1465
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,240
if any one of you is interested

1466
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,880
so um that being said this is you can

1467
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,200
find the useful some useful link

1468
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,240
which are the the project page

1469
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,400
halfwayrouter.net

1470
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,480
we have a blog where you can find a lot

1471
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,440
of articles interesting article that we

1472
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,480
that will help you uh install your home

1473
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,880
router with our product which is what

1474
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,559
are you i'm using right now where

1475
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,839
during this vc um and we have also docs

1476
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,200
that freewater.net

1477
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,720
where we are trying to provide a a

1478
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,520
control plane documentation

1479
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,000
related to that if you want to reach us

1480
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,440
uh you have

1481
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,160
our user mailing list if you want to

1482
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,119
contribute

1483
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,240
and add your own um yeah your bits and

1484
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:28,960
bytes into

1485
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,480
into the control plane and also the

1486
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,400
before that application where you are

1487
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:37,119
very welcome to to contact us and um

1488
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,319
an iits specific thing here is uh if

1489
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:43,200
any one of you have something that works

1490
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,319
or badly works

1491
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:46,640
please contact us and we are more than

1492
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,079
happy to make some interrupts

1493
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:53,920
yes thank you and uh we you can follow

1494
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,400
us on

1495

you you we are pushing

1497
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,799
uh uh frequently uh new uh new progress

1498
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:06,839
uh articles and an experiment

1499
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,839
uh and special thanks to all of this

1500
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,119
uh uh our organization

1501
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,280
we uh which make everything possible

1502
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,559
because uh we just

1503
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,280
we really did not reinvent the wheel but

1504
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,319
we assembled a lot of existing

1505
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,720
working technologies coming from the the

1506
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,520
whole

1507
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,680
this whole organization and sub project

1508
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,559
so

1509
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:36,319
thanks any question

1510
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,240
no questions on the mic you've

1511
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,200
dumbfounded the room

1512
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,440
yeah so i think a more clear call to

1513
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,960
action cannot be given

1514
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,640
we know there is a bunch of vendors out

1515
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,079
there implementations this

1516
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,960
is a free pretty sizable test bed

1517
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,000
obviously the p4 stuff is available

1518
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,800
so there's barely excuse not to run beer

1519
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,400
[Laughter]

1520
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,079
all right ken thank you that was

1521
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,760

um does anyone know i mean i forgot the

1528
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:21,599
name of it but

1529
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,319
you know isn't there also an equally

1530
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:25,200
large

1531
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,559
test bed in the u.s is are you folks i

1532
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:29,760
mean

1533
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,160
i'm not aware much of what goes on in on

1534
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,160
research there but

1535
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,559
have you folks from giant heard anything

1536
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,640
from from the u.s side

1537
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,319
yes we were contacted or we contacted

1538
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,520
the economic

1539
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,640
history perfectly so i

1540
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,760
usually uh made a guy

1541
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,160
from esnet and he gave me an access to

1542
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,520
um the bastion server where from

1543
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,480
he told me that i have an access to a p4

1544
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,559
switcher somewhere in the states in

1545
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,839
a university campus and that uh

1546
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,400
that site as far as i know uh somehow

1547
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,079
connected to our test but

1548
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,440
that is i if you are really interested

1549
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,079
please drop

1550
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,119
uh look via mia and i will find a guy

1551
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,000
uh and i will contact connect you with

1552
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,319
him

1553
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,440
and at this point uh we will be oh they

1554
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,119
they don't talk to me so that's that's

1555
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,839
why i'm asking here

1556
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,160
oh no they they're not allowed to to to

1557
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,920
talk to us because of uh

1558
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,039
the the government ah i see i see at

1559
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:37,680
this point

1560
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,200
i will make the communication or or

1561
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,359
if you have if you have a virtual image

1562
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,559
done then i can run it

1563
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:46,400
obviously and i can make the interrupt

1564
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,240
or we can have a gre

1565
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,359
or anything i really want to

1566
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,359
i was just curious whether you know the

1567
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,480
us folks

1568
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,400
in in research are also picking up the

1569
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,440
ball yes

1570
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:01,599
i already know one guy from the estate

1571
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:03,119
and the other from the from the

1572
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,240
university

1573
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,319
i hope you know do you know the

1574
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,160
university guy you are allowed to talk

1575
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,839
to

1576
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:12,960
don't you no they they

1577
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,880
they don't want to talk to us or else

1578
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,319
they are losing funding when they talk

1579
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,719
to somebody

1580
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:25,359
okay but but i know that uh

1581
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,759
there is a p4 switch that is surrounded

1582
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:28,640
by uh

1583
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,158
by juniper and uh cisco boxes

1584
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,399
and probably probably others i saw them

1585
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:35,439
in ldp

1586
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:39,040
and if you can somehow provide the image

1587
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:39,679
to them

1588
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,960
at this point he can perform a very good

1589
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,439
uh

1590
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,238
experiment because uh from uw-site we

1591
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,238
regularly can inject

1592
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,439
real i mean broadcast from my house

1593
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:53,120
that if you if you saw on the

1594
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,640
presentations link i

1595
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,960
i did a demonstration where i i had the

1596
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,198
music broadcast into two rooms but it is

1597
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,279
available in all the pops in the test

1598
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:02,000
but

1599
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,399
i think it's the same for for the states

1600
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,439
so basically when i

1601
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,319
press the play button here uh you hear

1602
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,799
the same at the states

1603
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:13,759
thank you through beer

1604
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,158
just be more factual we we we

1605
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,238
have a respect to u.s uh area

1606
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,359
they have a before test bed and we which

1607
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,319
and we plan to connect to this testbed

1608
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,960
via chicago

1609
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,920
fantastic yes it is it is another uh yes

1610
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,479
and

1611
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,920
the third one uh that i heard about um

1612
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,158
the essence guys are cooking something

1613
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:43,198
on top of uh smartnix

1614
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,479
but i i didn't uh went too far to

1615
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:48,319
to ask them what they are planning to do

1616
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,719
with that

1617
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,000
all right we are crunched uh time wise

1618
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,520
uh i wanted to give you guys all that

1619
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,120
for certain some of these connections

1620
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,880
and uh you know getting connected and

1621
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,080
understanding the links that's all there

1622
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,760
in the presentation

1623
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,679
you can download take it to the list and

1624
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:04,960
we can hopefully get more people

1625
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,840
connected

1626
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:09,600
any other questions or comments about it

1627
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,880
we're there excellent thank you guys

1628
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,000

1641
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,800
we hear you i someone is telling me that

1642
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,440
you can

1643
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,360
hear me it's just that i can't hear

1644
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,120
anything for some reason while i'm

1645
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,560
talking

1646
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,480
correct i'll just go ahead

1647
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,120
all right you can tell me whether you

1648
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,840
can hear me okay

1649
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,239
okay so i'll just go ahead

1650
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:31,760
yeah please um go to the next slide

1651
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,840
please

1652
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,120
okay so um uh

1653
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,040
yeah this slide talks about the the cur

1654
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,280
it says currently the source address is

1655
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,280
assumed to be a beer prefix but that's

1656
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,800
actually the previous version story

1657
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,239
about that so

1658
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,239
so we used to get the beer prefix by

1659
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,480
looking at the source ip address

1660
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,719
and then somehow knowing the subdomain

1661
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,000
so that we can

1662
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,440
figure out which b friday that refers to

1663
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,800
but that's kind of a hack and

1664
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,280
we figure later that well we could get

1665
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,120
this info from the beer header but

1666
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:07,520
that's

1667
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,120
difficult when we have

1668
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,480
basically something operating at layer 3

1669
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,920
or at low layer 3. so we wanted to do

1670
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,640
the same as

1671
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,800
in the pin draft to explicitly specified

1672
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,920
e4db prefix and subdomain

1673
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,280
id in the message itself

1674
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,640
so we got this generic

1675
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,360
rgmp mlg extension mechanism now defined

1676
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,839
in pim

1677
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,400
and that is something that we are using

1678
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,560
now in this draft

1679
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,440
so the pin working group draft past

1680
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,320
working group

1681
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,840
last call and publication has been

1682
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,480
requested

1683
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,880
so hopefully that will move on next

1684
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,520
slide please

1685
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,679
okay this is just from that pin drop

1686
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,000
that shows how the generic mechanism

1687
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,520
works so um

1688
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,440
there is a restored bit indicating that

1689
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,159
this mechanism is being used

1690
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,679
and then what is defined as the um

1691
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,280
auxiliary data section in

1692
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,960
in igmp version 3 and mld version 2 rfcs

1693
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,159
is being used to contain this extension

1694
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:24,719
so in this report message you see here

1695
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,000
there is

1696
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,120
this extension part at the end of the

1697
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,840
usual report next slide please

1698
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,360
and this is what the extension looks

1699
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,320
like it's basically a list of tlvs

1700
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,320
and then it's up to other documents like

1701
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,840
our document to define the types that we

1702
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,880
need

1703
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,520
next slide

1704
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,600
so this is the proposed extension in in

1705
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,480
this draft

1706
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,400
so we need an extension type from

1707
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,000
ayanna there is a length that will be

1708
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:04,560
either

1709
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,920
7 or 19 depending on the address family

1710
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,760
and then it's the subdomain beef ready

1711
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,760
and beer prefix

1712
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,239
so one thing here is the there is no

1713
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:16,879
alignment

1714
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,840
you can fix that if you like but in

1715
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,159
general with these tlvs there's no

1716
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,280
no attempt at

1717
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,480
aligning so even if this one was aligned

1718
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,719
it would be a problem if the previous

1719
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,199
tlv was not

1720
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:35,360
aligned like the length would not be a

1721
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,000
multiple of four perhaps

1722
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,920
but i don't see a reason to be aligned

1723
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,840
here next slide please

1724
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,719
so um yeah it's a little bit difficult i

1725
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,560
can't hear anything while i'm talking

1726
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,360
but i'm gonna

1727
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,840
turn off my microphone here now but at

1728
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,760
least as far as i know this document

1729
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,320
should be

1730
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,560
ready for last call i don't have

1731
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,199
anything else at least that i

1732
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:03,759
my variable that should be added thanks

1733
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,880
so let's just take a stab at the room i

1734
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,640
think where's that tool here if i can

1735
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,040
find it there's a voting tool here

1736
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,199
oh here we go on top countdown okay

1737
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,400
i'm implementing uh sorry implemented

1738
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,400
you have hands tool there we go

1739
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,000
yeah so this is just uh

1740
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,120
we are uh this is the beer mld dock okay

1741
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:39,280
that's what i'll call it

1742
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,199
all right i just started a session see

1743
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:43,120
who can just get to see the room here

1744
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:43,679
and we'll take

1745
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:45,520
the list later who thinks this doc is

1746
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:53,840
ready for last call

1747
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,560
so what do we do we raise hand how do we

1748
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,560
do this

1749
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,560
there we go here they come all the

1750
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,920
voting button should

1751
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,679
have some funky color and there is a

1752
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,239
race and do not race under the top

1753
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:08,080
got it see the raised hand at the top

1754
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,880
now all right

1755
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,599
we got seven and growing

1756
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,600
eight

1757
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,000
all right i think it's we've got a good

1758
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,280
sense of the room we'll take it to the

1759
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:25,760
list

1760
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,159
and uh hopefully move this thing along

1761
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,159
thank you steve appreciate it

1762
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:32,239
i'm going to end the count it's in the

1763
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:33,360
notes

1764
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:37,440
there we go all right all right

1765
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,440
did you say next slide

1766
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,120
i think tether already went we are

1767
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:53,519
at mldp signaling over beer human

1768
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,760
uh just like can you guys hear me yeah

1769
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,880
we can hear you

1770
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,320
and i'm bringing up the deck here

1771
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,320
and i can hear you guys so that's a good

1772
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,760
sign yep

1773
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,679
i'm also right going the right direction

1774
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,920
huh

1775
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,480
so you will hear the jokes we crack

1776
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,959
about you

1777
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,199
and wow all right perfect

1778
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,679
so this is just a refresher of of this

1779
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,960
draft

1780
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:32,719
first thing first i want to give a

1781
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:36,560
high five kudo whatever to sandy

1782
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,480
she actually had a look at this draft

1783
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,560
and caught couple of

1784
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,000
mistakes my brain is kind of fried with

1785
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,239
this covered stuff in north america but

1786
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:47,920
anyway thank you very much sandy i

1787
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,440
appreciate that next

1788
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,000
slide please

1789
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,880
next slide number two please

1790
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,760
what's it do it it says goes one to four

1791
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,600
so what do you see i see a slide number

1792
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,400
one

1793
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,480
okay thank you very much so just a

1794
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,960
little background why this draft

1795
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,440
we are seeing uh some of the operators

1796
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,199
they want to

1797
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:22,000
upgrade their network to a beer

1798
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,199
infrastructure

1799
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,600
uh they usually start with upgrading the

1800
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,920
core to the beer infrastructure or part

1801
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,199
of their network

1802
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:32,880
and basically this draft exactly like

1803
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,199
pim signaling over beer brings a

1804
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:36,960
mechanism that they can grab

1805
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:40,640
a part of the network and replace it

1806
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,760
with beer

1807
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,800
without doing any upgrade on the

1808
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,880
other part of the network which is

1809
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,400
running the mldp

1810
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,040
point to multi-point tunnels it's a very

1811
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,040
simple way of grabbing your network and

1812
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,800
upgrading it to a beer in different

1813
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,840
segments of the

1814
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,320
of the network slide number three please

1815
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,679
can you see it feels like this is taking

1816
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,040
more time

1817
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,320
oh yeah i think there's a lag okay so

1818
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,560
basically the draft is very simple it

1819
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,880
uses the rfc 7060

1820
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,320
that rfc has been used to tunnel uh

1821
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,440
mldp over other type of

1822
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,880
domains including rsvpt domain etc etc

1823
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,199
so we are using the same track here

1824
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,560
uh basically the tldp is

1825
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:31,600
stitching if you will the two

1826
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,840
access mldp domains

1827
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,480
together we need to find the

1828
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,600
ebbr and ibbr

1829
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,800
just a refresher for the folks out there

1830
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,480
the bbrs are the beer boundary routers

1831
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,000
so the ebbr is the router closest to the

1832
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,040
source

1833
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,800
the ibbr the ingress pbr is the router

1834
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,000
that is closest

1835
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,600
to the host if you will or to the leaf

1836
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,320
and this is exactly the same as the pim

1837
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,159
signaling draft

1838
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:09,600
so the mechanism to find the ebbr

1839
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,360
again exactly the same as the pim

1840
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,679
signaling draft there are multiple

1841
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:18,159
mechanism that can find that ebbr

1842
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:21,360
router when the ebbr router is

1843
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,719
found on the ibbr

1844
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,760
you could actually set up your tldp

1845
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:28,719
session

1846
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:32,080
to the ebbr either manually

1847
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,960
or via automatic mechanism that is

1848
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,719
beyond

1849
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:39,760
this draft when the session

1850
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,320
is set up the tldp session is set up as

1851
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:43,520
i mentioned previously

1852
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,040
it just stitches the two mldp

1853
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,800
domain over the beer domain

1854
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,080
slide number four please

1855
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,120
so while it's loading i'm just gonna go

1856
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,040
ahead uh so from the datapath

1857
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,159
perspective

1858
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:03,920
the egress boundary b router uh tracks

1859
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,360
all the effects uh mldp fix and it

1860
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,480
actually

1861
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,840
uh builds a table if you will

1862
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:16,000
of all the ibbr routers the

1863
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
routers that are beer boundary routers

1864
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,480
that are closest to the leaf

1865
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,600
that are interested in that fake and it

1866
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:24,480
will actually

1867
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,679
grab that signaling information and send

1868
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,000
it

1869
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,840
up stream to the root router

1870
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,600
and when the traffic comes back the ebbr

1871
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,760
actually uh encapsulates the traffic the

1872
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:40,560
mldp

1873
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,920
the the mpls traffic uh

1874
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,199
over a beer and sets all the bits

1875
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,600
in the beer header appropriately based

1876
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,400
on the

1877
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,040
downstream beer boundary routers that

1878
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:54,239
are interested

1879
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:57,360
and it shoots out the

1880
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:02,080
the traffic over the actually i think uh

1881
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:03,760
sorry i think you need to go to number

1882
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,280
four uh

1883
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,800
they're all labeled four okay so c5

1884
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,960
my

1885
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,760
this is the last four the third or

1886
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,840
fourth four

1887
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,840
if i go back to the full view we can

1888
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,800
only have five sl

1889
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,480
yeah the slide that says that about

1890
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,639
traffic flow that's the good aspect

1891
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:31,360
thank you

1892
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,840
thank you very much um so that's the

1893
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:34,560
slide i just

1894
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,360
explained uh when the traffic comes back

1895
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,560
from the route

1896
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,120
it gets encapsulated into the beer

1897
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:41,760
header

1898
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,800
and it goes to all the

1899
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,320
egress beer forwarding routers

1900
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,000
over beer and the egress routers

1901
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
remove the beer header and just swap the

1902
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,120
ldp label and just shoot it to the

1903
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,239
leaf routers if you will

1904
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,840
last slide please

1905
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,560
it's just the adoption call well

1906
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,600
no uh and that's the part that it was

1907
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,719
that's why yeah so

1908
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:20,960
we are not asking for adaptation

1909
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,840
basically it's

1910
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,760
already been adopted thank you very much

1911
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,960
working group uh

1912
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,440
yes what you're asking for is uh if

1913
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,280
there's any comments and we are hoping

1914
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:29,600
for

1915
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,440
alaska yeah this is the wrong

1916
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,639
version uh my apologies uh sandy

1917
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,440
has actually uploaded the right version

1918
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,480
of the deck

1919
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,159
or the yes the deck uh there is a

1920
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:48,560
newer version that uh

1921
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,000
i just pulled it off the tools did

1922
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,679
should i grab another deck somewhere or

1923
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,159
are we cool

1924
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,000
i mean i i did my explanation i don't

1925
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,080
think we can we need to waste any more

1926
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,199
times uh

1927
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:00,960
the only difference is that i mean if

1928
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,639
you think if you think this is ready

1929
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,000
let's just get a sense of the room i

1930
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,679
mean i hope people have

1931
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:11,360
read it but uh at least so mld signaling

1932
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,840
sandy's on the mic sandy please take the

1933
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,040

1936
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,800

1940
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:32,960
see

1941
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,159
let's just get a sense of the room to

1942
01:24:34,159 --> 01:24:36,880
see where we are uh people think this is

1943
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,480
ready for last call and we can take to

1944
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,920
the list

1945
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,679
votes people are voting we have to

1946
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:44,480
pronounce

1947
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,880
deep appreciation to sandy as secretary

1948
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,520
she was saving our bacon all the time

1949
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:54,960
always uploading making agenda

1950
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,239
everything

1951
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:13,839
all right we got votes coming in

1952
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,920
all right slowing down we got five got a

1953
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,600
handful i think it's

1954
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,280
definitely a sense of who's read and

1955
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,280
replied no reject we'll take this as a

1956
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,679
list and start moving stuff along

1957
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,639
maybe i was cool right

1958
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,400
yeah we're running out of time no i have

1959
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,280
fun either way we'll

1960
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,880
be back on the list okay all right

1961
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,600
uh next i'm not going to save that

1962
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,719
i think it will be high

1963
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,159
next is oam

1964
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:56,480
yep

1965
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,840
and

1966
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,840
presenting

1967
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,320
excellent thank you um

1968
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,840
okay we can go to the next slide right

1969
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,840
away

1970
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,920
okay uh so um

1971
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,239
the ones uh document that is missing

1972
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:33,280
from this list

1973
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:37,360
is the recently a work group adopted

1974
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:42,320
a document on bfd and

1975
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,560
i really appreciate the support from the

1976
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,320
group by adopting this work

1977
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,600
and it's

1978
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,040
progressing what i wanted to bring up uh

1979
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,159
to the discussion

1980
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:57,760
and get your feedback uh are these four

1981
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,199
documents

1982
01:26:59,199 --> 01:27:02,080
uh it started a little bit backward we

1983
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,440
started working on

1984
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,520
uh performance measurement using

1985
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,679
alternate marking method

1986
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,960
and uh thanks to alvaro for his review

1987
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,120
comments

1988
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,719
we worked on addressing and documents

1989
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,800
posted the version

1990
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,600
and really appreciate the feedback uh if

1991
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,000
we

1992
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,080
address the comments but what's

1993
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,080
important that uh was pointed in the

1994
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:26,880
review

1995
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,000
that uh the document

1996
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,639
um refers to the requirements document

1997
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:37,679
and uh it doesn't seem

1998
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,760
very logical to advance the solution

1999
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,840
uh before the requirements being

2000
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,159
advanced

2001
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:50,159
and uh we believe that oem requirements

2002
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:50,880
document

2003
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,000
uh has a value uh

2004
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,040
it might have well some consider it to

2005
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:57,760
be only

2006
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,159
uh just as a historical value

2007
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,880
and uh if it's informational uh

2008
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,040
reference it would not

2009
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,159
affect uh progress of a

2010
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:13,520
standard track to my understanding

2011
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,800
so there is a uh this way forward just

2012
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,159
to leave this document

2013
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:21,600
oem requirements uh in its current form

2014
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:25,199
or work on it if there are any comments

2015
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,960
recommendations to improve it

2016
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,320
and then in the meantime progress the

2017
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,199
solutions

2018
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:36,239
uh to publication uh

2019
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,960
the other way around is to complete the

2020
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,520
work on oem requirements the publish as

2021
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,199
informational document and

2022
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:49,600
then as it progresses

2023
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,000
move forward with their solution

2024
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:52,800
documents

2025
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,159
such as listed here performance

2026
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,040
measurement using

2027
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,360
alternate marking method uh which is a

2028
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,480
hybrid uh

2029
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:05,280
measurement method according to rfc7799

2030
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,840
uh path mtu discovery i know that we

2031
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,480
have

2032
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:12,239
um another solution and we discussed it

2033
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:13,040
and we

2034
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:16,639
i believe uh agreed to have

2035
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,239
documents separate not to merge them

2036
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:25,520
and then uh beer ping uh

2037
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,120
this is currently in expired state but

2038
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,159
we are discussing working on update

2039
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,800
and it should be published in a

2040
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,880
reasonable time

2041
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,560
so with all that said um

2042
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,199
i looked and i believe that uh

2043
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:45,679
requirements

2044
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,080
in performance management and ping they

2045
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:49,040
do have

2046
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:53,360
volunteers uh who agreed to be

2047
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,719
shepherd and uh really thank you guys

2048
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,600
um bath until you discover is still

2049
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,159
looking

2050
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:03,840
for shepherd and if somebody volunteers

2051
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,719
i promise i will owe you one more

2052
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,800
shepherd document

2053
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:12,320
so with that

2054
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:16,400
open to your comments questions

2055
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:21,840
and suggestions

2056
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,639
got one chat

2057
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,600
oh that's just a boat no i think we're

2058
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,320
clean

2059
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,199
any other comments

2060
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,199
some more requests for shepherds

2061
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:38,320
all right thanks greg yes and uh

2062
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,560
actually you know just the direction so

2063
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,440
what we uh

2064
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,159
we'll do uh with the documents how we'll

2065
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,840
progress them

2066
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,600
perfect yeah

2067
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,639
okay i i can't separate that i'll i'll

2068
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,400
have a look at it yeah

2069
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,120
let's move we got 30 minutes left i'll

2070
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,600
write you all you one

2071
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,600
sorry i was in another chat the

2072
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,520
agreement is to shepherd witchdraft

2073
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,920
woman

2074
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,320
king that was just

2075
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,360
no no i i believe the thing has we i

2076
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,480
believe i'm looking for birding uh

2077
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,360
mtv discovery

2078
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:31,840
hi everyone can you hear me yes we can

2079
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,280
so today i'm going to present the enemy

2080
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,000
of us

2081
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,639
like slice

2082
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,960
kumano greg please

2083
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,000
this draft will provide a faster

2084
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,600
production for

2085
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,360
brte so basically faster protection for

2086
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,840
transit node in in bht domain

2087
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:02,159
so this protection will not have a

2088
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:03,440
performance state in the

2089
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,879
in the light of the core like slice

2090
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,280
so for the blte uh we have two

2091
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,639
types of b bit positions one type of p

2092
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:18,719
position is for equals node

2093
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,760
so they call the local d cap b

2094
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,800
position another type of bit position is

2095
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,639
for adjacencies for forward

2096
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:32,080
connected adjacencies so here

2097
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:35,120
we use a number plus a prime to

2098
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,120
represent these kind of

2099
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,800
bit positions

2100
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,480
so for any pft

2101
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,159
bfr there is a forwarding table

2102
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,000
so this fourier table will have 40

2103
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,520
entries for all

2104
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,600
its adjacency b positions

2105
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,679
for example for the fourteen table on

2106
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:02,880
node b they will have four

2107
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,400
entries because b have a four

2108
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,840
of adjacencies y is from b to

2109
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,199
e which is in indicated by

2110
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:15,600
two prime and then and otherwise from b

2111
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,639
to c

2112
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:19,840
is integrated by four prime and so on so

2113
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,840
in order to

2114
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,679
provide faster protection

2115
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:27,360
for any transit node so we just

2116
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:30,960
extend each entry

2117
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,080
in the normal forwarding table with

2118
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,920
a fr entry so this fr entry

2119
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,280
contains a flight we call the fopa

2120
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,600
which is sort of for fr protection

2121
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,560
active

2122
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,760
and then the

2123
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,239
number of bicarbon pass so this backup

2124
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:51,040
path

2125
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:54,560
is for the when

2126
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,840
the one one maxwell fails the backup

2127
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,880
pass

2128
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:02,639
will be from this local node to

2129
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,480
the fairness of the legacy like hope

2130
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,960
so in normal operation the normal

2131
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,560
forwarding behavior will be

2132
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,080
applied so when one node has a transient

2133
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,440
node fails

2134
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:19,360
so the fr entry

2135
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:22,400
will be used to use

2136
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,440
bike up paths to send the package get a

2137
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,639
rounded affiliate point

2138
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:32,719
to the next select top so next page

2139
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,600
so here we have a more details through

2140
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:36,960
example

2141
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,080
so here we have a path from a to

2142
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,199
destination

2143
01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:44,320
d and h so the path

2144
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:47,199
is identified with the green so we have

2145
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:48,159
two branches

2146
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:51,040
in this path one part one branch is from

2147
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:51,840
a to g

2148
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,719
to h so another branch is from a to b to

2149
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:55,600
c

2150
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,040
and to d so your normal operation

2151
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,400
so that any package with this path

2152
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,760
will send it to these two branches

2153
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,800
so that means from uh along the

2154
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,800
upper branch from a to g to h and then

2155
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,360
the practice was also similar to along

2156
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:15,840
the

2157
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,480
second branch which is from a to b to c

2158
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,760
m to d

2159
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:22,239
that's normal operation so when we have

2160
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:23,520
a failure

2161
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:26,400
of a transient node for example when c

2162
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,520
fails

2163
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,159
in this case so the package will

2164
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,239
continue send along the upper branch

2165
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:35,920
which is from a to g and to h

2166
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,520
but for the second branch

2167
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,639
so when node b detect the failure of

2168
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,840
c the flag

2169
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,280
for c entry fr entry

2170
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,480
will be set to 1. so in this case

2171
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,600
the fr entry will be used to forward

2172
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,400
packages

2173
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:00,080
to around the phaser load c using backup

2174
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,639
paths

2175
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:03,840
from b to d so here by composites from b

2176
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,119
to g to h and to d

2177
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:10,239
before sending the path

2178
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:13,920
using backup paths the node b

2179
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,159
will remove egress

2180
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:21,920
bit point four which is for for h

2181
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,199
because these four is on the back of

2182
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:26,560
path

2183
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:29,920
but this four is loud on any branch

2184
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,800
plus branch starting from b so we need

2185
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:33,840
to remove this

2186
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:37,679
uh dispute position four and then we add

2187
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,560
backup bit position for biker bus so

2188
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,239
with this modified

2189
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:45,360
bit string so the package will

2190
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:49,199
be delivered along the back of us to d

2191
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:53,760
so next page

2192
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,520
so this is the updated forwarding

2193
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,880
procedure for

2194
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,000
uh support uh

2195
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,920
f b t f r so for

2196
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,440
microsoft node n if this node n has a

2197
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:10,560
transient node of a path so

2198
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,639
the procedure will check whether this

2199
01:37:12,639 --> 01:37:14,400
node n is failed

2200
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:17,920
if node n is failed so the

2201
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:21,440
node b for example b will

2202
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,480
will remove b position for the adjacency

2203
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:24,960
to

2204
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,239
to node n and then it will remove those

2205
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:29,440
kind of uh

2206
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,320
eagle speed positions if that bit

2207
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,040
position

2208
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,800
is on a biker path and then also but not

2209
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,040
on any branches from from plr

2210
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:43,840
so after removing those uh uh beat

2211
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,440
position for each node

2212
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:49,199
and then the prr will

2213
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,960
send the package along the backer path

2214
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,760
to the right leg scope on the pass

2215
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,080
so this is through clean the appeal

2216
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,440
position for the jc

2217
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:00,719
from n to n slack hop and then add

2218
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:03,119
the beta's positions for the biker pass

2219
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:03,840
then we

2220
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,840
the normal procedure will be used to

2221
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:07,520
forward the package along the back of

2222
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:07,920
path

2223
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,320
to the leg stackers hope next page

2224
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,199
so this uh this pursuit code

2225
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:20,239
uh give more details about the app

2226
01:38:20,239 --> 01:38:22,320
upgrades so basically the highlighted

2227
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:23,360
part

2228
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,280
is the part for supporting

2229
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:31,440
the bftfrs

2230
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,080
next page

2231
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,920
so we just welcome a

2232
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:41,280
comment for this draft

2233
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:46,080
uh so first question why uh i understand

2234
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,040
correctly this is

2235
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,560
updating only the brte path

2236
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:54,560
right 40 pounds yes

2237
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:57,920
so my comment is yeah well sold out and

2238
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,000
since we have to study the architecture

2239
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,480
probably necessary tolus is probably the

2240
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:03,440
best judge of that

2241
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:08,239
thanks for the work thank you

2242
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,920
excellent thank you all right moving on

2243
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,199
the next deck

2244
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:17,199
it is t egress protect

2245
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,119
same presenter oh you've got a stack

2246
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:20,719
right here perfect i'll just queue them

2247
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,400
up here for you

2248
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:27,839
uh to egress patek

2249
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,159
now it still makes me start and stop

2250
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,159
sorry

2251
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,638
all right

2252
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,639
got it yes uh this is about a

2253
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:46,719
bat eagles production next page

2254
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:50,080
this will provide a fast protection for

2255
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:51,040
egress nodes

2256
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,280
in the badt domain so this production

2257
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,320
also

2258
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,119
not have any per flow space in the core

2259
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:00,159
of the network next page

2260
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,840
so basic idea is that first we need to

2261
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,000
configure

2262
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,199
the bike up egress

2263
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:16,239
for protect egress so after this

2264
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:19,440
configuration so the information about

2265
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,199
which one protector which one will be

2266
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:22,800
distributed to

2267
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,239
the director adjacent node so those

2268
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:29,840
adjacent node will extend the forwarding

2269
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:30,560
table

2270
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,199
before the table so with the bicarb

2271
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:33,679
entry

2272
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:36,880
to protect primary evos node using

2273
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,000
backup

2274
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,639
equals node and then in the normal

2275
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:41,840
operation

2276
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,119
the package will delivered along the

2277
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,639
normal path so as soon as

2278
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:51,840
a pr detect the failure of its lifestock

2279
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,679
as an eagles node

2280
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:57,600
so that plr will use extended

2281
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,719
bicarbonate entry to for the package

2282
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:03,280
along the back of pass to the bike up

2283
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,400
equals node

2284
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:07,040
next page

2285
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,040
so this gives more details about the uh

2286
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,760
extension to the beautiful ordering

2287
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:14,480
table

2288
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:18,239
or equals protection so basically

2289
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,600
for a node x so

2290
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,800
for each of equals node connected to the

2291
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,520
x

2292
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:29,040
so we just extend that entry with

2293
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,639
a record by this bike happens you will

2294
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:35,600
have a flag epa which is standable

2295
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:36,400
equals

2296
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:39,760
production active and then the backup

2297
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,560
path

2298
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,679
which is from local node to

2299
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,600
the backup equals node

2300
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:52,080
so for example here we have

2301
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,320
the extended table folding table on node

2302
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:57,520
c

2303
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,000
so node c we have e was not d

2304
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,440
so d is protected by h so

2305
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,679
for the forward entry with lights over d

2306
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:09,199
as the equals node

2307
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:12,480
so we will have a byte path from

2308
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,239
c to this bike up

2309
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:19,360
uh eagles node h so backup position

2310
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:23,360
is here is is there so similarly for

2311
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,760
node f if load f is the use node and

2312
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,040
then we have a

2313
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,000
protective node for node f for example

2314
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,040
is the e

2315
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,239
and then we have a backup path from c to

2316
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:35,440
e

2317
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,440
so your normal operation so the normal

2318
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,560
part of this

2319
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,960
forward table is used for the package so

2320
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,080
when note

2321
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,960
onenote as the equals of the fails then

2322
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,920
the prr

2323
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,320
will use the backup untree to forward

2324
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,040
the package

2325
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,119
along the backup path to the by copper

2326
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:56,080
equals node so next page

2327
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,600
this uh give more details uh using

2328
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:02,159
example for example we have paths from

2329
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:05,760
from a to equals d and and f

2330
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,480
so your normal operation so the package

2331
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,280
will be divided

2332
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:12,159
from a to b and then to c and c will

2333
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:13,840
deliver package to

2334
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,960
to d and that and f so

2335
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,000
when he was not a b yes

2336
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,320
so note c will detect this failure and

2337
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,880
then the flag epa

2338
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,440
for for for the entry d will be set to

2339
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,159
one

2340
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:31,760
so in this case c will use bicarbonate

2341
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,800
entry to for the

2342
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,639
package to d through uh the bike up pass

2343
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:41,440
the bypass is from c to h and then

2344
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,159
the package will send it from c to h and

2345
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:44,800
then

2346
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,320
h will deliver the particle to the

2347
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,840
destination ce

2348
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:53,199
so next page so this gives more details

2349
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:53,840
about the

2350
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,960
uh procedure updated for supported

2351
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:00,000
equals protection so basically for

2352
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,520
a node n as a equals node in the package

2353
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,080
so the procedure will check whether this

2354
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:06,800
node n

2355
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,840
failed if this node n failed and then we

2356
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:12,639
will remove the old path from the bit

2357
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:13,360
string

2358
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,400
to the that equals node and then

2359
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,760
we will also check whether this by half

2360
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:22,159
equals note is already in in some part

2361
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,040
in the past

2362
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,880
so if it is already in the past we don't

2363
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,520
do anything if you fight over use those

2364
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,040
beauty positions for backup you know

2365
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,639
it's not in the past and

2366
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:33,920
so we just send the package along the

2367
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,239
biker path to this backup equals node

2368
01:44:36,239 --> 01:44:38,799
next page

2369
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,119
so this pursuit code will give more

2370
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:44,480
details about

2371
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,159
the updated procedure which is the

2372
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:47,520
highlight part

2373
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:52,239
for support batee eagles protections

2374
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:55,040
the next page

2375
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,840
so we would like a welcome any comments

2376
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,960
for this draft thank you

2377
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,280
any comments

2378
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:13,760
all right thanks for next to the next

2379
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,320
one which is uh fr

2380
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,559
yes

2381
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,119
oh it's right it's not going to show it

2382
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:31,839
i gotta quit and start over sorry

2383
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,800
you're on so this is about the

2384
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:42,239
pf uh faster route nice page

2385
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:45,840
so i would like to uh thank you for

2386
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:46,719
those people

2387
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:48,239
for their valuable comments and

2388
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:50,400
suggestions jeff

2389
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:52,400
and the daniel and the shirsung for

2390
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,239
their video comments and then i

2391
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:56,719
addressed those comments and i made the

2392
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:57,360
updates

2393
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:00,239
uh for the for the draft so the main

2394
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:00,719
updates

2395
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:04,639
is that we change the status of a draft

2396
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:08,239
to experimental and then in the draft we

2397
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:09,679
describe it

2398
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,480
in details about the difference between

2399
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:14,719
the existing existing draft and our

2400
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:15,600
draft

2401
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:19,840
and then we add some text talking about

2402
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,600
compressing the fr forwarding table

2403
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,840
next page

2404
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,639
so the difference uh between the

2405
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:32,960
existing one and the our draft

2406
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,760
so the existing draft the the idea is

2407
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:36,239
that

2408
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:40,000
the quotation based uh fr so basically

2409
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,199
for when knight's hope fails so

2410
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,080
the prr will tunnel the package to the

2411
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,320
leg stack is hulk

2412
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,119
that's the basic idea so in more details

2413
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:51,679
the

2414
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:55,840
vf14 table will have two for the entries

2415
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,280
for each equals note that called primary

2416
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:00,560
forward entry

2417
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,560
with the primary next hop and the

2418
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,440
primary beta mask

2419
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:08,239
i have a bi-cover for a bike hub for the

2420
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:09,280
entry

2421
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:13,040
with the bike up max hop and the biker

2422
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,040
mask bit mask so when

2423
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,159
one node fails

2424
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:22,800
so this node will be considered as a a

2425
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,840
primer

2426
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:27,600
nice hop so any package

2427
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,840
which is to be sent to the primary

2428
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:31,199
laptop this special

2429
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:34,080
primary laptop will be forwarded using

2430
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:36,000
the bicarbonate tree

2431
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,760
so with icub microscope and the bicarb

2432
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,360
must be the mask but for all the other

2433
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:45,440
packages

2434
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,119
those packages will be forwarded using

2435
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:52,320
primary voltages

2436
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,520
so the issue is that because all those

2437
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,280
primary interests the primary microscope

2438
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,159
and the primary

2439
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:03,199
beta mask are computed

2440
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,719
using the topology before the failure

2441
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:11,119
so after this failure all those

2442
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:14,320
private desktop and primary bitmask

2443
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:17,760
need to be recomputed and updated

2444
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:21,840
so before this new computation or

2445
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,440
recomputation

2446
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:26,480
so the all the other package some of all

2447
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:27,119
the aspect

2448
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,840
packages maybe get lost because of those

2449
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,000
kind of inconsistency

2450
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,239
so our draft resolved these issues

2451
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:39,679
so the idea of our java is that we

2452
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,719
based on the our lf fees

2453
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:46,080
so when next fails we use

2454
01:48:46,080 --> 01:48:48,880
the rfa by carbonite's hope in addition

2455
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,000
to that

2456
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,800
we use multiple 14 tables we call that

2457
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,840
fr

2458
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,119
14 tables so each fr

2459
01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:00,800
4d table is for one max hop

2460
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,920
so in this fr for the table it will

2461
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,520
already consider

2462
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,400
the failures for all the beta mask and

2463
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,040
the

2464
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:13,040
next parts so when one max hopper fails

2465
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,239
so the fr for the table for this special

2466
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:17,040
laptop is

2467
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,400
used to fold all the packages so next

2468
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,638
page

2469
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:27,599
so we're also talking about compressing

2470
01:49:27,599 --> 01:49:31,520
the for 40 table so before confirmation

2471
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,280
the size of the table is the lambo for

2472
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:38,080
b equals equals nodes so after the

2473
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,040
comparison

2474
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:42,080
the size of a table will be the number

2475
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:42,800
of

2476
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,360
labels minus one so after the

2477
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,400
compilation

2478
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:50,000
so the two uh proposals

2479
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,960
regarding to the memory use will be in

2480
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,760
the same level

2481
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,080
so some sometimes this one will use more

2482
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,360
and then sometimes

2483
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:02,000
another one is more so next page

2484
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:06,080
so any query comments are welcome and

2485
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,679
then we would also consider maybe

2486
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:08,320
adoption

2487
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:11,840
any ideas

2488
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:17,679
no comments uh

2489
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:20,800
so as a workgroup participant no chair

2490
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:22,960
uh well i originally think much of the

2491
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:24,000
whole idea because

2492
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,040
no pretty much igp protecting the fr

2493
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:29,760
but i see the value of that i mean so

2494
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:31,760
your drop is pretty much formalizing

2495
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,119
what igp is doing

2496
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:36,320
but it goes natively into beer and yes

2497
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,679
yes

2498
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,560
value if you for example don't i mean

2499
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:42,000
the compression is neat

2500
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,320
but i don't even know if it's necessary

2501
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,679
but sure

2502
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:48,000
but i think to put it natively into beer

2503
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,080
has the value because

2504
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,719
if people start to program biffs over

2505
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:55,199
controllers or not use igp or anything

2506
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,560
like that this is of course a very

2507
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:57,920
useful technology

2508
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,000
so you know i kind of changed my opinion

2509
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,480
i think it has a certain value it it

2510
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,639
it explains really much what igp is

2511
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:05,599
doing anyway

2512
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:08,000
i think you know in you know in a more

2513
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,280
obvious way but

2514
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,080
uh it you know it's not a bad thing

2515
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,400
actually

2516
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,639
excellent thanks tony yeah i agree

2517
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:21,920
that's the environment where

2518
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,280
you're doing controller programming you

2519
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,239
still need the functions that you don't

2520
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:26,719
get with igp makes lots of sense

2521
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:29,920
yeah all right so what's next just went

2522
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,920
was it an adoption call what was the

2523
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:32,960
last

2524
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:36,639
slide why more

2525
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:40,400
you you translate

2526
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,280
no do you seek just comments or do you

2527
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,920
seek adoption

2528
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,440
as a composer

2529
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,360
okay and then we can go uh because this

2530
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,760
is disappointing

2531
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,920
i think we should have a vote can you

2532
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,280
start let's do a vote then

2533
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:00,400
all right uh let's turn that off

2534
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:03,440
i'm going to start a

2535
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:05,199
sort of session there it is all right

2536
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:17,839
and this was

2537
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:24,080
i added a g sorry about that typing

2538
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:25,280
quickly

2539
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,239
so there's a fr draft adoption call

2540
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:31,839
thinks this is

2541
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:42,840
thanks tony we have couple of object

2542
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,239
objections okay so objections please on

2543
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:47,679
the mic we also because we have to

2544
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:51,040
understand why the objections

2545
01:52:52,080 --> 01:52:56,840
so we have 42 okay please comment on the

2546
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,320
mind

2547
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,400
uh people have two hands and i think

2548
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:01,360
they're confused is that

2549
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:04,400
no you cannot push both buttons okay

2550
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:08,159
um can i go yeah go for it

2551
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:11,440
yeah uh my understanding is that beer

2552
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,360
that one of the idea of beer is that

2553
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:15,920
does not create a state in a transit

2554
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:16,880
node

2555
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,960
uh fr requires a state in a transit node

2556
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,040
so no no no no

2557
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:28,080
no because we don't have any per

2558
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:31,119
state per flow state

2559
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:34,159
in the transit node no

2560
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:38,080
no because you cannot protect

2561
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:41,760
uh without knowing your next hop

2562
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,920
so you're protecting for the specific

2563
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:44,960
flows

2564
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:49,199
that are controlled from the uh dfir

2565
01:53:49,199 --> 01:53:53,199
and uh yeah we have uh

2566
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:54,960
can extended forwarding table we call

2567
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:56,880
the fr folding table

2568
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,560
we only have these four new tables it's

2569
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:00,320
a limited size

2570
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,480
and then we don't have a performance

2571
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,360
space

2572
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,480
but that's that's exactly what is that's

2573
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,560
exactly what is a state

2574
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,679
in a transit node yeah but we already

2575
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:13,199
have i mean we have bits

2576
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:15,199
this is just a bigger bit this is not

2577
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:16,719
the per flow

2578
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:20,960
or a tree right and how much

2579
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,400
that's right let's minimize is size the

2580
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,960
size is limited

2581
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:29,119
no not flu states that's the difference

2582
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,880
if we run igp and protect we have

2583
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,400
exactly the same state just in a

2584
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,199
different form

2585
01:54:35,199 --> 01:54:37,199
depending on the element to be honest

2586
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:38,320
you know this is this

2587
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,800
is what igp is doing anyway it is just

2588
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,400
folded into pieces

2589
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,880
okay so let's have a discussion that's a

2590
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,199
good one

2591
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,840
yes

2592
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:04,159
yes please

2593
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:06,239
can i just ask a quick question here uh

2594
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:07,199
just to ensure that

2595
01:55:07,199 --> 01:55:10,639
the uh i'm in sync my understanding um

2596
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:11,440
so

2597
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:13,520
i just want to understand you the

2598
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:14,639
proposal here is

2599
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:18,719
just to use the igp uh won't reroute

2600
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:20,239
nothing else right so

2601
01:55:20,239 --> 01:55:22,639
all we are doing here is that if it

2602
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,960
gives you a protection next up

2603
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,639
you're using that protection next up

2604
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,480
whether it's the

2605
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:32,400
act of next lab or lfa or remodel fa or

2606
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,000
or whatever it is

2607
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,679
is that it or are you guys actually

2608
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:37,280
creating a

2609
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,280
second beer table for the fast rear

2610
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,840
yes we you see we have a fr forging

2611
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:44,639
table

2612
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:48,159
for each lex hop because uh

2613
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:52,000
f of ipfr using ipr

2614
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,280
ip folding table here use

2615
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,159
beer folding table so that's in

2616
01:55:58,159 --> 01:55:59,040
different

2617
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,000
different folding tables so for beer we

2618
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,920
need a special

2619
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,520
enhancement for the bf40 table

2620
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:15,840
to provide faster protections

2621
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,440
and i probably should say something but

2622
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:25,280
it's productive tall as you get to it

2623
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,239
i think the uh the beer taste check is

2624
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:28,639
uh

2625
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:31,920
kind of the the stateless uh check

2626
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,920
right that something does does something

2627
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:36,159
really smell like beer is uh

2628
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:39,119
does the state in the transit hop

2629
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:40,080
changes

2630
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,000
when a sender becomes active goes

2631
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,679
offline or receivers

2632
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:46,239
appear or go away right does that change

2633
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:47,280
the state

2634
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,679
on the transit hops and i think uh when

2635
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:50,480
it does not

2636
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,960
then it tastes and smells like beer and

2637
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,840
that's why this tastes and smells like

2638
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:56,639
beer

2639
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,960
yeah i mean i i like beer smell

2640
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,080
otherwise but yeah i

2641
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:02,400
i agree that's that's that's a good one

2642
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:03,760
um so who won

2643
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,920
did you clarify that otherwise please

2644
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,400
take the mic

2645
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:12,480
yes somewhat like i i think my point is

2646
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:12,960
that

2647
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:15,840
the beer next hop that the bift is built

2648
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:16,719
from igp

2649
01:57:16,719 --> 01:57:18,880
anyway right i mean you you grab the igp

2650
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,800
information well the architecture does

2651
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:22,159
not tie us to igp

2652
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:24,000
that's what we grab and it's one type of

2653
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,360
signaling but the architecture is

2654
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:26,960
independent there are people doing the

2655
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:27,440
whole diff

2656
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,159
stuff over controllers or cli and we

2657
01:57:30,159 --> 01:57:33,040
don't preclude that

2658
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:34,960
so i agree on that but then we're going

2659
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,560
to have multiple

2660
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,480
type of fast reroutes right one fast

2661
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:40,400
reroute is going to be just igp is going

2662
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,760
to give you a protection next hub

2663
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,679
whatever that protection next up

2664
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:45,920
is going to use i think it's up to the

2665
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:47,520
draft to explain

2666
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,639
right what happens if you run igp

2667
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:54,239
right when do you use technology

2668
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:56,400
and and i'm i'm good with all the uh my

2669
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:57,920
entire point here is that

2670
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,719
it would be beneficial if you agree on

2671
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:01,520
one

2672
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,400
type of fast reroute protection right so

2673
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:04,960
i mean

2674
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,840
in igp or any type of other technology

2675
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,199
you have ecmp

2676
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:11,599
as one type of protection and then you

2677
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:12,719
have uh

2678
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:15,040
bypass or fast rer that's another type

2679
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:16,159
of protection

2680
01:58:16,159 --> 01:58:18,639
having multiple ways of skinning this

2681
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:19,360
cat

2682
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:21,199
would create issues of interrupt

2683
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:22,800
etcetera etcetera that that's all my

2684
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:23,440
point

2685
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:25,760
yes you definitely need a drop must be

2686
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,440
very explicit about this style so when

2687
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,360
you run igps signaling these droppers

2688
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,280
will probably say do not use that but if

2689
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,480
you don't have an igp

2690
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,159
and you need protection here's the

2691
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:36,320
solution and i think it fits fine into

2692
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,080
the architecture but it just might

2693
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,599
take right

2694
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:45,760
so i don't see them adding state i don't

2695
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,199
see them breaking architecture

2696
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:50,880
actually i see them in a sense the draft

2697
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,159
to filling in a possible

2698
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:56,719
gap in in the architecture if somebody

2699
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:00,080
wants to use it without igp

2700
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,840
more people on the mic

2701
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,560
all right so i'm trying to add the next

2702
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:11,040
deck and it's not letting me share i get

2703
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,719
this error over and over it's like it

2704
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:14,320
starts and stops

2705
01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,560
so i don't know someone could try to use

2706
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,320
that

2707
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:21,040
maybe i can grab it himself i see that

2708
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:21,679
the beer

2709
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:24,080
for our adoption was eight to one at the

2710
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,040
end

2711
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:28,639
so pretty clear we take it to the list

2712
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,280
and basically start an adoption call i

2713
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:32,800
say a discussion about a possible

2714
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:33,599
adoption call

2715
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,159
okay thank you

2716
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:39,360
all right can uh chen can you grab this

2717
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:41,119
deck yourself like i can't seem to bring

2718
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:43,360
it up now macheco is giving me an error

2719
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,199
request is not allowed by the user agent

2720
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:46,560
or in the platform in the current

2721
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:47,760
context

2722
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,280
so i don't know what state i'm in but

2723
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:59,840
it's not letting me share a document now

2724
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:05,360
anyone tony can you hear me

2725
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,960
wow no one can hear me now

2726
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:14,560
okay gotcha so chad i'm trying to bring

2727
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,280
up the next

2728
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:18,560
uh egress protect draft

2729
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:20,320
uh your presentation and it's not

2730
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,159
letting me share it

2731
02:00:22,159 --> 02:00:24,080
so if you can grab it yourself from the

2732
02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:25,920
tool or if tony can bring it up that we

2733
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:26,560
can get

2734
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,679
this next deck going

2735
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,159
picking notes just give send me the

2736
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:36,000
screen cindy can you project please

2737
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:40,320
and should i share a screen

2738
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:43,360
for more

2739
02:00:43,360 --> 02:00:45,280
yes if you can get the last two

2740
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,480
presentations up

2741
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,320
and then do a share screen and run

2742
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,000
through them i i'm i i'd have to

2743
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,440
disconnect and try again because i'm

2744
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:51,920
getting an

2745
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,679
error every time i try to uh share a

2746
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,119
screen

2747
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:58,080
okay let me try

2748
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:08,239
yep you're granted there you go wow

2749
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:09,679
it lets me grant you but i can't share

2750
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,080
my own

2751
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:16,400
oh i hate the lager to choose

2752
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:18,879
okay

2753
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,679
yeah you may be having some bandwidth

2754
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:23,920
issues oh here comes

2755
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:29,040
all right great thank you eventually

2756
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,119
so basically this is about ba equals

2757
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:37,040
protection next page

2758
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:40,000
so we uh made some updates to the

2759
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,040
previous version

2760
02:01:41,040 --> 02:01:43,679
so uh

2761
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,280
so we just uh more details about

2762
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:48,400
differences

2763
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:50,639
from the existing one and some identical

2764
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:51,840
changes

2765
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:54,639
so next page

2766
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,360
so here the difference that uh our draft

2767
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,719
just uh for

2768
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:04,719
provider equals production we just use

2769
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:06,000
one pass to

2770
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,639
from source to eagle's node but for

2771
02:02:08,639 --> 02:02:09,760
existing

2772
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,960
mofr that use two

2773
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,000
disjoint paths

2774
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,800
from source to each of the eagles note

2775
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,360
and then

2776
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,320
the eagles node will select one of the

2777
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,040
traffic

2778
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:26,480
because two same traffic to from

2779
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,480
source to the same destination so the

2780
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,920
destination will select

2781
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:33,119
one of them so in this sense so

2782
02:02:33,119 --> 02:02:34,880
our equal protection will use less

2783
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,719
network resource

2784
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:42,239
than the existing one so next page

2785
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,400
so for this one i think uh we will uh

2786
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,920
welcome more comments

2787
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,480
because adoption because we'll have more

2788
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,199
options

2789
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:54,400
for example jeffrey proposed another

2790
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,000
solutions for equal protection and then

2791
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,159
we need more discussions

2792
02:02:58,159 --> 02:03:00,960
maybe merge or whatever next step thank

2793
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,199
you

2794
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:07,840
yeah from my side uh sure i think you

2795
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,360
should have it together with jeffrey and

2796
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:10,480
you guys should

2797
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,400
talk it out whether you want one single

2798
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,599
draft and then

2799
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:15,199
explaining rest protection for in all

2800
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:16,880
the different cases like helper

2801
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:18,560
and this case you know and whatever you

2802
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:20,560
have and possibly even for

2803
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:23,040
pe protection egress protection into the

2804
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,599
same token

2805
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:53,040
sorry there's something wrong

2806
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,839
no actually starting

2807
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:04,239
okay can you see it yeah

2808
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:07,520
okay okay okay and

2809
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:10,239
because the time limit i will do a very

2810
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:11,199
quick

2811
02:04:11,199 --> 02:04:14,480
uh update and hello everyone

2812
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:17,199
i'm sand from zte this presentation is

2813
02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:18,079
for the update

2814
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:21,280
of beer redundant ingress road traffic

2815
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:24,000
overdraft we have caused a great trend

2816
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,520
and the issue from china mobile

2817
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:34,239
and the update of this version

2818
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:37,360
is that the title of this draft

2819
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:40,000
has changed from beer source protection

2820
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,199
to be a redundant

2821
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:44,159
ingress router fair over because the new

2822
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:44,560
name

2823
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,840
is more accurate and suitable and in the

2824
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:49,440
new version we added

2825
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,280
the reference to the draft which

2826
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:52,639
discusses the

2827
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:56,079
redundant ingress router failover

2828
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:59,599
issue in mbd working group this draft

2829
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:02,400
analysis the issue in bureau domain

2830
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:05,520
and in this version modi's description

2831
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:06,719
is added

2832
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:10,079
and such as the issue analysis the node

2833
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:11,520
failure detection

2834
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:14,800
the working path failure technician

2835
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,760
the following has pages has been

2836
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:18,480
presented

2837
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:22,639
in several meetings such as

2838
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:25,920
1 0 8 meeting so i will skip

2839
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:29,119
them very quickly

2840
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:33,360
if you have some question you can ask me

2841
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:35,840
to answer it

2842
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:42,000
maybe just skip them to the last page

2843
02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:45,920
so this draft has been printed

2844
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,400
in several meetings so and it's an

2845
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:52,480
informational draft we think this draft

2846
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:53,920
can give some guidance

2847
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,199
for beer deployment if working group

2848
02:05:57,199 --> 02:05:59,520
approves we'd like to request the

2849
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:02,239
working group for adoption

2850
02:06:02,239 --> 02:06:06,959
thanks any comments

2851
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:14,639
hello yeah we're here

2852
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:17,520
greg you started a call who i was on the

2853
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,159
mic

2854
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:21,119
yeah i'll start a vote on this uh

2855
02:06:21,119 --> 02:06:22,000
where'd it go

2856
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:31,840
yeah there we go

2857
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,440
get one more goal please go ahead

2858
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,560
you wonder uh in the draft you mentioned

2859
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:38,960
that

2860
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,480
you have a pfd for the titan failure of

2861
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:46,159
the node inside the via domain

2862
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:47,679
why do you need that for english

2863
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,159
production

2864
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:54,400
sorry and you mentioned watch the

2865
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:58,320
in the draft in the

2866
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,800
uh you describe a lot of things for

2867
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,960
detecting the failure

2868
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:07,360
inside the via domain

2869
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:10,719
so this is not a

2870
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:14,800
not directly related to the redundancy

2871
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,719
english level or english protection

2872
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:18,639
something like that

2873
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:23,199
and now and because

2874
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,119
sunday yes yes

2875
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:30,159
um so because uh there is a

2876
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:33,599
redundancy in uh bfir

2877
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:36,800
so uh point to multipoint bfd can be

2878
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:37,719
used by

2879
02:07:37,719 --> 02:07:42,239
bfers to detect uh the failure of their

2880
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:46,320
active source and then change it

2881
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:49,679
so uh if you can uh suggest any

2882
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:52,239
other way to detect the failure there

2883
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:54,000
will be uh

2884
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,199
much appreciated but

2885
02:07:57,199 --> 02:08:00,800
we don't have any other itf standard

2886
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,679
uh mechanism to detect the failure in a

2887
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:05,360
multicast rather than point to

2888
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:09,520
multi-point bfd

2889
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:11,280
so i think in the draft you also

2890
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,679
describe the detection the failure

2891
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:16,000
for example a transient node in the

2892
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,960
network

2893
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,040
uh for the power it's the same it's the

2894
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,079
same because

2895
02:08:20,079 --> 02:08:23,159
for the bfer uh the failure is

2896
02:08:23,159 --> 02:08:24,560
indistinguishable

2897
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:28,159
what the bfr detects is uh

2898
02:08:28,159 --> 02:08:32,000
the segment of the uh multicast

2899
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,440
distribution tree

2900
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:36,800
is not uh working so because

2901
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:40,560
uh how point to multipoint bfd works is

2902
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:44,800
that uh the root sense periodically

2903
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:48,719
control packets so that uh the leaf

2904
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:51,920
or tell in terms of point-to-month to

2905
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:54,560
point b of d

2906
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:57,679
knows from the previously received

2907
02:08:57,679 --> 02:08:58,560
packet

2908
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:01,360
and calculates their failure detection

2909
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:02,400
interval

2910
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:04,719
so if there is no control packets

2911
02:09:04,719 --> 02:09:06,400
received with the control packets

2912
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:07,920
received within this

2913
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:10,960
interval uh the lead declares

2914
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:14,400
uh the network failure

2915
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:17,840
and that uh equally applies either to

2916
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:20,719
failure of their

2917
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,400
root or the failure of their

2918
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:25,840
distribution path

2919
02:09:25,840 --> 02:09:30,639
so there is no need for their

2920
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:34,000
egress to differentiate

2921
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,840
two types because if there is no repair

2922
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:41,599
because in this use case

2923
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:46,480
uh there is alternative

2924
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:50,719
source of their uh data traffic

2925
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:52,960
so for the leaf it's a simple to switch

2926
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:54,320
to uh

2927
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:57,360
the alternative source

2928
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:00,639
does that answer a question no i i mean

2929
02:10:00,639 --> 02:10:02,480
you i think uh you have description

2930
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:04,639
about detect failure

2931
02:10:04,639 --> 02:10:07,199
of a node inside the be a domain i think

2932
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:09,280
that may be not unnecessary right

2933
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,560
you can determine the failure of a

2934
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,400
source and uh

2935
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:14,159
that's a that's for sure that's that's

2936
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:16,159
good but you need to need to detect the

2937
02:10:16,159 --> 02:10:17,199
failure of

2938
02:10:17,199 --> 02:10:19,360
a transient node inside be a domain

2939
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:20,320
right

2940
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:22,800
why if it's a transit node essential to

2941
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:23,840
distributing

2942
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:27,360
particular flow uh we're detecting it

2943
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,599
and we are not differentiating again i

2944
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:30,719
want to stress

2945
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:33,040
we are not differentiating the failure

2946
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:34,239
of

2947
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:39,519
uh the root

2948
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,880
uh the head of the multicast tree uh

2949
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,159
from the

2950
02:10:44,159 --> 02:10:47,440
failure of any segment or any transit

2951
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:49,440
node

2952
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:52,800
from the standpoint of bfr

2953
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,719
so there is no uh need to dis

2954
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:58,239
differentiate this uh

2955
02:10:58,239 --> 02:11:02,239
types of failures so what detection is

2956
02:11:02,239 --> 02:11:06,000
that it stopped uh receiving

2957
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,239
for certain interval vfd control packets

2958
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:12,800
and that's interpreted as a failure of

2959
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,159
their

2960
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:18,320
distribution tree and trigger some

2961
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:25,840
switch over action

2962
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:38,000
okay cool i see the pole being nine to

2963
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:38,800
zero

2964
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:42,079
so we'll take her to the list

2965
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:51,760
thank you thank you sandy

2966
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:53,679
all right that is all we have on the

2967
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:54,880
agenda we are

2968
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:56,880
already 12 minutes over and no one has

2969
02:11:56,880 --> 02:11:59,119
cut us off this is pretty exciting

2970
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:02,560
uh blue sheets don't exist because

2971
02:12:02,560 --> 02:12:04,639
you've already signed up it's been done

2972
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:07,760
we got jeffrey and then on to

2973
02:12:07,760 --> 02:12:09,199
tony i believe they finished up the

2974
02:12:09,199 --> 02:12:12,879
notes was it tony

2975
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,360
got it all right we'll see that in email

2976
02:12:15,360 --> 02:12:18,239
any other comments before we move on

2977
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:19,679
and you go off to your lovely day here

2978
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:22,159
in prague

2979
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:27,440
all right thank you very much productive

2980
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,840
meeting you guys have a great week here

2981
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:33,119
yeah thank you very much cheers yeah

2982
02:12:33,119 --> 02:12:34,560
thanks for participating that was a

2983
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,960
great one

2984
02:12:46,679 --> 02:12:49,679
later
