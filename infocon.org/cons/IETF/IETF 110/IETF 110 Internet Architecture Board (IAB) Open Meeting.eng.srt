1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
can see the mid echo and the slides but

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
then i recommend you to try to

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,600
hide all the other menus

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,360
uh i can share the full screen

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,039
because i all the technicals

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
to hide the possible frames

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
so in english there should be an upper

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
menu which is called view or something

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,199
like that

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,279
and then you usually can select which

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,840
kind of bars you want to see or not

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
yeah one of those

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,600
maybe unselect the one the two that you

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,320
have selected

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,479
yes and now unselect the other one as

16
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,840
well this one you just like newly opened

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
basically

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,360
i think the menu where you've been i'm

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,799
just guessing because i can't read

20
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,520
anymore

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,040
the menu where you've been there was

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
another another one ticked so if you

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,799
untick that one

24
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400
the lower one f9

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
i guess i don't know

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,240
this is the language the issue okay

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
so i kind of show the circling okay yeah

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,000
full screen is a better for oh you can

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,600
maybe just like actually probably can

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
take the sidebar and you just like

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
uh take the line and just move it to the

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,600
left

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
no just kidding okay i don't know

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,719
i can't help you okay but i guess we

35
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,240
should we should actually start very

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,759
soon

37
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,840
yeah okay

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
introduction about this

59
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,159
the ib open meeting so that's in fact

60
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
this is the third ib open meeting

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,799
so this meeting is a

62
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
ib organized session uh focus on the

63
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,360
technical and

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,560
architectural topics so this

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
objective is to increase the visibility

66
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,480
of the ib

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,159
work and also to collect feedback

68
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,519
and community input about ongoing and

69
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,319
the new

70
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,360
ib work so

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,640
besides this the ib open meeting

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
we have the several of these the main

73
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,239
list so

74
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,799
including this the architecture discuss

75
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,000
main list

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
for the architectural discussion and the

77
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,319
ib documents and the ib

78
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,840
at ib.org for comments and

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,200
concerns directly to the ib

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
and we also had this the program mainly

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
list

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,680
for direct comments on work of a

83
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
specific

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,400
program so this is the ibu

85
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,199
ib open meeting and the corresponding

86
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,479
main list

87
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,719
for the specific ib work

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
so this is the agenda for this ib

89
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
open meeting so this including the topic

90
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
first is the welcome and the stage

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
updates

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
and then this is the tommy will

93
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,440
introduce the edm program

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
so then this is the open macro phone

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,840
so this is the agenda do you have any

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,240
this

97
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,440
the uh my idea to bash the

98
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,039
agenda yeah i mean actually i want like

99
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
i would like to add something so if you

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
look at the meeting material

101
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
there's an additional presentation there

102
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,759
where we uh where yari actually

103
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,680
summarized nicely

104
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,919
um some of the previous discussions

105
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,199
around centralization

106
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
and previous work that happened around

107
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,560
centralization um

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
so that is something that he curated

109
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,039
based on the discussion we had yesterday

110
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,039
in the in the plenary

111
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,280
and so after tommy's talk we will take

112
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
his slides go quickly through that and

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,199
then

114
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
start a discussion there

115
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,000
okay so we will add this the

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,520
topic about the centralization from the

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,840
uh yari okay any other

118
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,239
idea for the batch agenda

119
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,560
okay so then we will go to the next

120
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
okay uh mira

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,560
that's your turn to introduce the

122
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
updates of the ib documents and the

123
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,919
programs

124
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,759
okay here okay thank you um yeah so as

125
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,440
usually we try to update you a little

126
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
bit on the technical work we're doing

127
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,160
um so since the last meeting we

128
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,800
published

129
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,440
one rfc um this one has been around for

130
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,960
a while but it's finally published and

131
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
has an rfc number and that's a report

132
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,280
for

133
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,680
the data workshop um but the more

134
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
interesting news is that we also have

135
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
now a draft for the kovit 19 workshop

136
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,280
which is workshop that happened last

137
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
november

138
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,680
um so that's kind of reasonably new but

139
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
it's already in very good shape

140
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,600
we got a bunch of video comments already

141
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,880
um it's a

142
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,199
research it's a workshop report which

143
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,720
means like i don't think i hope there's

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
not like a huge amount of discussion

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,919
about what needs to be in the document

146
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,440
it's really trying just to report what's

147
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
happening um i have the feeling that

148
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,240
this is

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,639
kind of ready so we will soon decide to

150
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,639
go for a final community feedback on

151
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,599
this draft

152
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,280
and then hopefully publish it very soon

153
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
src so

154
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
um if you haven't read this yet and you

155
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,319
want to read it it's a good time now but

156
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,919
we will also send out an official

157
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,280
community call

158
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,840
um yeah so yeah that's only workshop

159
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,199
reports this time the

160
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,440
um we might come up with new documents

161
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
soon

162
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,599
let's go to the next slide

163
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,039
yeah then um program updates um

164
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,599
last time in the iab open meeting we

165
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,440
reported a little bit that we looked at

166
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
our programs

167
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
and we also considered the structure of

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
the programs

169
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
a little bit and we discovered that we

170
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
have like two different kind of

171
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,720
programs one set of programs is really

172
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
focusing on technical work where we want

173
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
to engage with the community more

174
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,560
and then there's another set of program

175
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
which is usually a small focus groups of

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,440
experts

177
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
that help the iab to do their work to do

178
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,919
to work on their responsibilities

179
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,319
so that's why we we introduced this

180
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,520
restructuring

181
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,160
of programs and since then we've been

182
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,919
working on also reviewing all the

183
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,520
programs we have to make sure

184
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
and they are fit for purpose basically

185
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
they serve they surf

186
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
and support the iab in the way they are

187
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,319
supposed to be

188
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,039
and what we did is we looked at two of

189
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:11,360
the

190
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
programs which are more in the group of

191
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,199
admin support groups

192
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
um so not technical programs but i still

193
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,599
want to quickly mention this here

194
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,039
because that has been recent work even

195
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,319
so it's like not really

196
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
bringing the technical and architectural

197
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,240
discussion for concussion forward

198
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,520
so we have the ayanna program

199
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,240
which will now become the ietf iana

200
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
group

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,599
so the chatter of this program will be

202
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,799
updated

203
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,200
and what we do is we align a little bit

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
the activities and the

205
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
communication we have we had with diana

206
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
into this program matching up with

207
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
reality basically

208
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
you might have seen that there was

209
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,320
already a mail on this send out to the

210
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
architecture discuss list

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
so you had a chance to comment there you

212
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,680
can still comment but basically this is

213
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,040
ready and and

214
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
the iab is is ready to go ahead and make

215
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
this change

216
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,399
the other um support group or

217
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
previous program is the liaison

218
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,680
oversight program

219
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,600
and the iab decided to close this

220
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,040
program

221
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
and first of all we like to thank all

222
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,959
program members for their service

223
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,800
and this program has been dormant for

224
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
many years there was really no activity

225
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
and that's because this program wasn't

226
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,760
like even so the name

227
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,160
seems to suggest that wasn't um involved

228
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,000
in the actual oversight of the liaison

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,880
management

230
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,399
the program was very active in defining

231
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:32,800
how

232
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,959
liaison management works and defining

233
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,480
processes

234
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,640
and providing advice but the kind of

235
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
day-to-day oversight work was like taken

236
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,760
up by the iab directly for a long time

237
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,240
and we are currently working on also

238
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
improving this liaison management

239
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
and that's what you will see on the next

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,399
slide

241
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,880
um so this is what the iab is currently

242
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,120
doing we're in the process of

243
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
looking at our liaison management and

244
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
try to improve it

245
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
this is because we think it's really

246
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,440
important an important role

247
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
in the iab and we want to make sure it's

248
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,040
more clear

249
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,560
because there have been a lot of

250
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
confusions you know how who to contact

251
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,920
if you have a question like

252
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,760
when to send a liaison statement when to

253
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
have a lease on relationship and so on

254
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
so we really want to make this process

255
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,279
more clear and more transparent

256
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,040
and also improve the internal

257
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
communication and the view that the iab

258
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,519
has because sometimes it wasn't actually

259
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,839
easy to find out for the iab itself

260
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
um you know where activities are needed

261
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,680
or not needed

262
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,640
um another another point here is that we

263
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
also noticed

264
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
that we are at the point where we

265
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,600
actually have to work on knowledge

266
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,480
transfer

267
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,720
it is happening that people do retire

268
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
and we have to make sure

269
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,079
that we transfer this knowledge and that

270
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,720
we keep continuity of this knowledge

271
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,360
um for a bunch of experts in different

272
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
regions of the iab

273
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,640
itf um and

274
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
it's not enough to just like you know

275
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,519
have their email address put them on a

276
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
mailing list or whatever because those

277
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,800
people might actually go away at some

278
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
point so we have to be more active here

279
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
so one one thing that the ib already did

280
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,160
in this respect was we created a new

281
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
position within the iab which we call

282
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,040
the liaison coordinator position

283
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
so this position has the goal to be

284
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
really one clear contact point

285
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,640
for the lease or managers as well as for

286
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,320
the community

287
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,839
and therefore we have established an

288
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,440
email alias that you can

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,399
use to send us questions about liaisons

290
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
or lease on statement of course you can

291
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
still contact the

292
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,399
lease or managers you can still contact

293
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
the iab directly but also this

294
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,040
email alias is really for any um laser

295
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
related question a good first contact

296
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
point if you don't know who to ask

297
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,360
otherwise so this new position basically

298
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,279
replaces the current shepard structure

299
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,040
that we have the current structure was a

300
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,839
one-to-one

301
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,920
um structure where we had like one iab

302
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,160
shepard for each liaison manager

303
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
the liaison managers are stable

304
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,920
positions because that's where the

305
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,959
knowledge is about

306
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
the other sdo about like how to interact

307
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,160
with them

308
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,079
but then we had like a second person on

309
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,079
the iab who would be like the shepherd

310
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,519
and the contact point

311
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,519
and that was just like confusing because

312
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,519
we changed them on a yearly basis and it

313
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,200
was like many different people was hard

314
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,240
to find and so on

315
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,560
so like concentrating this on like one

316
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,360
position

317
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
which probably will be filled by two

318
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,639
people to have a backup um

319
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
should like make things more clear and

320
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,079
easier hopefully

321
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,320
but we're also still in the pro process

322
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,120
to define

323
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,959
this position a little more to figure

324
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,399
out if there are further tasks that

325
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:38,800
these

326
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
um people that fill the position can

327
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,160
take on and

328
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,839
we will provide you further information

329
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,720
hopefully very soon by email

330
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,320
but that's only really just the first

331
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,600
step there is more what we want to do

332
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,760
and because this is an important topic

333
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,680
and we also want to involve

334
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
community experts and lease our managers

335
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
to get feedback from them to understand

336
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,279
what needs to be done where improvements

337
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,360
are needed um

338
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
and i'm bringing this up here as part of

339
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,040
the

340
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,959
ibog meeting even so this is not on the

341
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,959
technical side it's really more

342
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,000
internal admin administrator but still

343
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
i think this is a good opportunity to

344
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,839
get you all the information as a

345
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,120
community that you need

346
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,639
especially that we now have this new

347
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,040
role but also to have a discussion

348
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,560
uh and have a forum for that and with

349
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,040
that i will make a pause

350
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,560
um i wasn't able to read the whole chat

351
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,639
but i will review it at some point but i

352
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,320
will give the people a community to

353
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
enter the queue and

354
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:49,839
comment if they want

355
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,800
so if you don't mind maria and robin

356
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,959
this is nice change is it public

357
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,240
somewhere beside this slide

358
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
um it's in the iab report again about

359
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,000
the liaison coordinator i will also

360
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,959
provide more detailed information soon

361
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:15,360
and

362
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,079
we are about to update the webpage i

363
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,440
thought we already did but maybe we

364
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,399
didn't

365
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,720
so it's like it's all fresh news and it

366
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,639
will all happen very soon

367
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,839
okay thank you

368
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,040
i just wanted to say that um

369
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
but i think this is definitely a step in

370
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,720
the right direction the uh

371
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,800
the situation lasts several years in

372
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,760
which there was

373
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,720
uh so much silence that if liaison

374
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,000
managers

375
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
needed help they couldn't figure out a

376
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,040
go-to was uh

377
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
was definitely a bad situation for all

378
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
concerned and uh

379
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,639
and i really appreciate that the iab is

380
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,199
uh is taking this seriously again

381
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,680
and uh and moving in some direction

382
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,399
which is

383
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,360
uh uh will keep both the liaison

384
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,680
managers and the ia be a little bit more

385
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
uh informed of what each other are doing

386
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,079
and coordinated so thank you

387
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,000
definitely that's the goal here i i got

388
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,440
a bunch of emails over the last year

389
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,600
where people just didn't know who to ask

390
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
um but it's also that like we have the

391
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
iap want to have um

392
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
a better view about what's happening and

393
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,800
to answer uh martin's

394
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,759
question from the chat so um this is not

395
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,360
an email list this is an alias that's

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
really just forwarded to the person who

397
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,440
are serving in this position

398
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,600
um and this this per the person who's

399
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
serving this position is usually the one

400
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
who can hopefully like some of the easy

401
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,199
questions just answer them directly if

402
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,959
it's more about you know process but in

403
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,680
other cases

404
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,440
it's also just like part of the role to

405
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
just forward those

406
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,480
questions the right people hopefully so

407
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,639
if it's for you will be forwarded to you

408
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,199
if you're a liaison manager um but we

409
00:15:59,199 --> 00:15:59,759
also

410
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,000
want to um add a function to the data

411
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,519
tracker that we can actually reach

412
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,120
easily all the leads or managers and

413
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,639
create a list for that because that also

414
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,320
doesn't exist right now so

415
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,839
many small things that we are looking at

416
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:23,839
at the moment

417
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,560
uh wait sorry i'm not looking at the

418
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
cube so charles you're

419
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,040
you're also in the cube

420
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,320
uh yeah hi um so um

421
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
one of the things i've been spending a

422
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,600
lot of time on and

423
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
especially recently is open source and

424
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,079
its relation to standards

425
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,880
and um you know there's a really nice uh

426
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,000
ongoing

427
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,279
set of sessions that uh open forum urum

428
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,839
open forum europe's putting on and

429
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,600
alyssa spoke there

430
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,920
um i also work closely with the linux

431
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,199
foundation

432
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,800
uh and i think they're they're talking

433
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
today i i think in general we need

434
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,199
uh i don't know if the liaison's the

435
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:07,919
right thing

436
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,240
but uh it doesn't work we have any

437
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,000
liaison with linux foundation or with

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,959
other open source

439
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,439
organizations and it's it's interesting

440
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,439
i think it's a bit of a problematic

441
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,760
when i've looked into it before the

442
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
what's come back is well you know you

443
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,000
don't have a

444
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,359
problem with uh open source

445
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,199
uh organizations and the liaisons

446
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,799
usually like

447
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,400
you know when we're when we're dealing

448
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
with problems but it just seems like

449
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
that liaison's a handy thing so that we

450
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
you know we pop up on their slides even

451
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
as an organization that

452
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,039
they're working with and that we have a

453
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
little bit more communication

454
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
as these worlds of open source and

455
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,440
standards continue to uh

456
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,919
um you know have more and more impact on

457
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,400
each other i'd say

458
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
yeah so this is two points here one is

459
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,760
um can you mute because it's echo

460
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,799
thanks so uh one point is that like

461
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,000
those cases where we

462
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
kind of had to establish a nissan

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,600
relationship it's often because the

464
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,799
other organization

465
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,720
requires us to have like this kind of

466
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,240
formal relationship to

467
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480
you know um get into the meetings access

468
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,919
their documents or whatever

469
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,280
and that's the case where we really need

470
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
a formula so in other cases it's

471
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,039
sufficient if like or it's usually

472
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,400
like just having the formal you saw

473
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,679
doesn't help that actually anything

474
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,640
would change

475
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,480
so it really is the people that have to

476
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,919
go there and work together and talk to

477
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,960
each other right and that doesn't

478
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
require a formal reason

479
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,640
but the other point really is here also

480
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
to figure out where we need to go and

481
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
who we need to talk to and so on and i

482
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
see that actually independent of like

483
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
the strict resource management itself

484
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,679
it's really about outreach it's really

485
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
about figuring out what other stos and

486
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,559
organizations are doing make sure we are

487
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,400
well aligned with them and that's

488
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,919
definitely a big field where we need to

489
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,520
do more work and i have this on my list

490
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,559
of to do's but i

491
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,919
to this put this a little bit in a

492
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,440
different bucket and it's definitely

493
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
something i want to drive forward and

494
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,160
discuss but it's also less

495
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,280
straightforward

496
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
because it's and you know it's sometimes

497
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,200
people go to other organizations and

498
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,039
they give a presentation at a conference

499
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
and whatever and that's always very

500
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
positive but like we don't have a task

501
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
force we don't have like a way to send

502
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,679
people somewhere

503
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,679
it's really kind of on like if they are

504
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,039
there if they have the possibility they

505
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,000
can do it

506
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,679
and but even for those occasions i think

507
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,039
we need better coordination and have a

508
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,600
better

509
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,280
visibility what's happening and who's

510
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
going where and telling what

511
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,919
so yeah i think that's more discussion

512
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,919
is needed

513
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,000
did that very quick thanks and sort of

514
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
your take on is how i feel too

515
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
it's like you know the people who are

516
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,880
involved everything's going well there's

517
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,240
not a problem there we're able to work

518
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,200
with open source

519
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
organizations very well it's just sort

520
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,240
of from uh

521
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,080
an optics point of view it almost looks

522
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
like we're not because we don't have

523
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,280
that liaison and

524
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,679
so i think and for some people who are

525
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,520
looking to get more involved in this or

526
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,000
don't know

527
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,440
what's already going on i think it'd be

528
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
very helpful as well

529
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
so okay that's a really good point so

530
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,080
maybe we should figure out how to make

531
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
this more visible on our web page and

532
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,039
wherever

533
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,919
yep yep if i can add to that really

534
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,799
quickly i think um

535
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,799
there's a lot of we the the important

536
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,799
thing to take into account is that all

537
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
technical you know discussions and stuff

538
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
should happen as

539
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,440
regardless of whether there's a liaison

540
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,360
ship and regardless of anything else

541
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,840
right

542
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,280
there's nothing stopping ietf

543
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
participants to engage in multiple other

544
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,039
communities

545
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,520
um the iab would definitely like to hear

546
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
of places where that's not working

547
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,760
right where where is a more formal

548
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,120
relationship as maria's you know

549
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,919
suggested

550
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,679
is actually necessary or where do we

551
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,039
actually need to

552
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,240
send sort of more official

553
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,799
correspondence um but

554
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,559
and i think you know we would love

555
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,799
feedback for what is working and what is

556
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,400
not working so that we can figure out

557
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
how to better you know update the

558
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,120
liaison management

559
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
roles in the first place and which ones

560
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
are working well which ones are not

561
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,280
um but don't let you know any of this

562
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,080
program stop

563
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,400
people from you know working in multiple

564
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
organizations and bringing work both

565
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,840
directions and correspondence both

566
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,559
directions

567
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,640
and i mean this is still not like a

568
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
structural approach but like if you have

569
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
information that you think it's like

570
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,360
about another seo but another

571
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
organization that you think is important

572
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,520
like

573
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
please send an email to the ib we are

574
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
always open for that and we're always uh

575
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,360
able to

576
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,880
are like keen to learn something so

577
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
i think we have more people on the queue

578
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,799
and bob

579
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,880
last year i got involved with ansi

580
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
on unmanned aircraft systems standards

581
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,919
works they're collecting who's doing

582
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,960
what

583
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
and i basically have to represent the

584
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,720
ietf

585
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,880
and what we are doing in our standards

586
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,080
which impact

587
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
uas um i did reach out to try to get any

588
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,320
lays under other official

589
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,520
um context i got only minimal support on

590
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,240
that

591
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,919
i think the final document coming out of

592
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
ansi was reasonably well

593
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,440
in including itf as an sdo uh

594
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,320
involved in uh unmanned aircraft systems

595
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,120
they

596
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,159
ansi then spill spooled up an effort on

597
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,120
satellite communication and i just did

598
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,960
not have the bandwidth or anything else

599
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,760
to

600
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,840
reach out to people to say hey ansi is

601
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,280
doing this satellite thing

602
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
and they've just published that document

603
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,799
and ietf is really not

604
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
mentioned at all in terms of satellite

605
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
communications

606
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
so just kind of saying that my

607
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,679
experience has been a little bit

608
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,840
on a struggle side particularly now i'm

609
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,039
dealing more and more

610
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,440
in more so we say closed sdos like

611
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,039
in aviation iko and working with

612
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,520
astm where they have some very

613
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,799
formal rules for liaisoning and it's

614
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,840
uh i'm just participating there as a

615
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,400
technical expert

616
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,120
but it's having more eye tip backing

617
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,919
may be of real value particularly if you

618
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,520
see

619
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,280
what's i've managed to get into the

620
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
the private network proposal for

621
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,320
aviation they call

622
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
grain and uh some of the uh

623
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
they do have um ik does have a liaison

624
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,039
with icann

625
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,000
but that's uh different in intent so i'm

626
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
just kind of uh

627
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,799
sharing with you that there is a um

628
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,080
other areas that we maybe would do

629
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
better and i don't know

630
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
if it should be i should be doing more

631
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,320
or how to proceed on this

632
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,159
yeah i mean i understand i understand

633
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
the point when you say you you would

634
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,840
appreciate more backing from the ietf

635
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
but on the other hand it wouldn't change

636
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,880
the situation that we still need

637
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,240
somebody like you who actually

638
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,440
participates in in

639
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
this organization and goes there and has

640
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,559
the time and the

641
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,320
bandwidth to actually contribute uh

642
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,600
where needed

643
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
and that's not necessarily always the

644
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,799
requirement we have for all the islam

645
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,240
managers it's really more like kind of

646
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
conflict handling when it comes up right

647
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,279
um so that's a much stronger commitment

648
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,360
uh that can may i ask you like who did

649
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
you reach out to when you did this

650
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440
last year um i'll have to look at the

651
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,720
emails and see

652
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
uh um and maybe maybe

653
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,840
lisa the ansi

654
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,440
um standards work um we did get an a

655
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,679
uh more or less an official right

656
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,720
wording

657
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,840
of uh i pulled together for what the

658
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,400
ietf is as an sdo

659
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,200
which they they wanted you know

660
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,080
officially

661
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,799
how do you define yourself as an sdo and

662
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,000
i and i

663
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,159
what did get pulled some wording

664
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,840
together to do that

665
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,120
uh and uh i'll afford you what i have on

666
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,440
that so you can see it

667
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,960
they were great thanks and then we have

668
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,159
braun i think uh

669
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,960
okay because of the reason of the time i

670
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,600
think we

671
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,480
have to cut the line i think the semen

672
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,919
is the last one

673
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,960
okay cool thanks

674
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,039
i was just going to say i'm i've kind of

675
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,080
wound up in an

676
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,159
unofficial liaison position a couple of

677
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,919
places have been invited as a technical

678
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,640
expert

679
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,240
to tc39s date time work that that we

680
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,520
talked about in dispatch earlier this

681
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:19,919
week

682
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,880
and also at the cal connect side i am

683
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,600
i'm

684
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,039
kind of unofficially at least the

685
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,799
liaison to iatf because i'm

686
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
a chair on the calendaring group over

687
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
here as well

688
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
is this something that that i mean i'm

689
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,960
sure there are plenty of other people

690
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,240
who are in similar positions

691
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,400
does this need to be officially tracked

692
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,919
or do we care if there's kind of

693
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,840
unofficial liaison stuff happening as

694
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,120
well

695
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,360
so it is there's no requirement to track

696
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,720
that uh i think it's it's

697
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,559
again generally a good thing if people

698
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,840
keep an eye out um

699
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
and promote ietf work in other

700
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,960
organizations um

701
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
i mean it's but i mean like you're also

702
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,240
not making any official

703
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,120
statements for the iatf in your position

704
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,559
right like you're if you're contributing

705
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,320
on a technical matter and you say

706
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,480
hey guys watch out there's some work in

707
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,240
the ietf that you should be aware of

708
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,640
that's

709
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,720
that's always a good thing if you if you

710
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
need some backing if you want some

711
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,679
support if you have a problem

712
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,520
that's really the point where you're

713
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
very welcome to reach out to the iab

714
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,440
uh or in general like we are always

715
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,880
interesting to learn what's going on

716
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,520
right

717
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,840
um and as i said like we we don't have a

718
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,679
good track record yet so it would be

719
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,679
helpful to learn more but we also don't

720
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,600
really know how to organize that in an

721
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,520
efficient way at this point

722
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
all right sounds good i will i will

723
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
write something up at some point

724
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,840
not right now thank you

725
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
yeah so martin let me just reply to that

726
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,279
one quickly martin mentioned that people

727
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,000
might

728
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,080
misrepresent work of the idf um

729
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,679
so that happens as well but like that

730
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,960
will always happen that's something we

731
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,400
don't have a control

732
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,440
of um the it's as i said like it's i

733
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,039
think there's a very

734
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,600
in very few cases the the need to talk

735
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,279
as the ietf

736
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,679
it's some sdo is required to have like

737
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,360
this official representations

738
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,679
but in a lot of cases i hope that we can

739
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,360
actually work together and do good

740
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,120
technical work by concentrating on the

741
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,480
technical matters

742
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,159
and and that's what what we all want

743
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,000
um yeah seaman

744
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
thank you um i'm i'm simon hickson

745
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
from i would note that i'm from vice

746
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,840
chair of the etsy board so i'm making an

747
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,120
observation from that perspective

748
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,640
although i'm not speaking officially on

749
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,440
behalf

750
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,200
on behalf of it's young i'm actually i

751
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,480
am from a uk government

752
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,080
government employee um it it's

753
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
it works quite awkwardly in the reverse

754
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,200
direction as well

755
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,520
when as etsy we want to talk to our etf

756
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
it's very difficult to work out

757
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,240
who to talk to unless we happen to have

758
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,799
individuals who are taking part in

759
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,000
in particular um from iatf from

760
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
groups within the room and i think

761
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,000
that's where

762
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,080
something like etsy with quite a strong

763
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,600
central secretariat

764
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,360
struggles against some something like

765
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,000
iatf with quite a small secretariat

766
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,039
um so i i

767
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,240
i don't really see any answer the

768
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,760
problem apart from sort of could we

769
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,679
strengthen the secretariat in some way

770
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,440
to do this which i appreciate is a cost

771
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,200
issue etc etc

772
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,520
and is there and is there and is there

773
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,039
and is therefore not easy

774
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,919
but i think sort of ietf would would

775
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,080
benefit in the overall

776
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,360
um sdo ecosystem

777
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,600
if there if there was some sort of

778
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,279
central contact point

779
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,279
that could do some of this interfacing

780
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,960
and again i appreciate that's not a role

781
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,600
that

782
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,679
the secretary of united curry takes it's

783
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,799
it's very much more of

784
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,880
an organizational thing but i think you

785
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,720
know as we as we get a more

786
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
integrated global system you know and

787
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
something like 6g demands that

788
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,320
standards interface all over the place

789
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,600
in ways in which they haven't done

790
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,480
before you know

791
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,600
we're going to need more sdo contact and

792
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,039
you know if if we can't get the sdo

793
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,360
ecosystem talking to each other better

794
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,520
and understanding each other better

795
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,640
um then we are going to

796
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,799
become more and more awkward and um

797
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,039
which i think will just fragment our the

798
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
overall seo system even

799
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
even even even more badly than arguably

800
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
at the moment you know and sort of how

801
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,279
do how do we do standards

802
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,720
et cetera et cetera so the the official

803
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,360
point here

804
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,679
contact point here is the iab and i hope

805
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,120
having a separate uh

806
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,039
email alias here that is like more key

807
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,480
to that it helps a little bit

808
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,240
and we will put the information on the

809
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,000
website in the right places hopefully

810
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
um even so the website might also not be

811
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,760
super clear and easy to find

812
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,960
um so i'm not sure maybe it's just like

813
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,919
a missing information to other seos like

814
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,440
that the iab is the right

815
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,760
point to talk to but to be honest if you

816
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,960
if you you know if you

817
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,120
um use any of the other email addresses

818
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,559
that you find on our website most of

819
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,159
them go to the secretariat and they know

820
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,840
how to forward this to the iap

821
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,559
so um it shouldn't be that hard to reach

822
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,640
as it's probably just like unclear

823
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,279
how to do it

824
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,279
okay do you think this like um a siemens

825
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,399
already gone right

826
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,760
do you think this like email address

827
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,000
will help or is there more kind of

828
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,039
advertisement needed

829
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,520
i would i would just an email address

830
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,279
would do does help

831
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,039
but it's actually being able to engage

832
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,520
in a two-way conversation with a person

833
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,600
who understands your system and can be a

834
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,520
central contact point of system

835
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,440
and in a way in which sdos with a larger

836
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
secretariat can and do

837
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,039
you know and i appreciate their they're

838
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,880
probably rather more formal than

839
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
we are in ihf you know but i think you

840
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,240
know as we get this

841
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,760
greater level of interfacing that i

842
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
think we need in in technology as a

843
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,640
whole

844
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,600
you know um i think all sdos have to

845
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,960
have to move with the times and then

846
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,360
we've

847
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,519
we've seen more and more sort of central

848
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,200
coordination in iitf as the years have

849
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,480
gone by

850
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,919
and i think as we move forward um

851
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,840
we we need a greater degree of central

852
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,120
coordination here

853
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,480
in the sense of people you can actually

854
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,240
engage in a conversation with

855
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,440
rather than just a a mailbox you can

856
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,080
i mean you can send an email to okay

857
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,039
that looks good

858
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,080
i think that's a yeah probably a

859
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,519
slightly separate problem because we do

860
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,039
have for example leadership meetings

861
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,320
with other seo sites

862
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,720
like i triple e and so on um so that's

863
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,000
probably more in this category but

864
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,679
it's a good input thank you

865
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,399
okay so next topic

866
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,919
is the edm uh for the latest progress

867
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
from the tommy okay

868
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
okay

869
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,960
all right slides up

870
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,320
okay thank you okay hello everyone um

871
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
i'll be giving a quick update on one of

872
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,760
our technical programs

873
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
which is one of the newer ones we have

874
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,960
um

875
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,679
this is the program that's on talking

876
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,200
about evolvability of protocols

877
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,120
deployability and maintainability

878
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,720
um and in a lot of ways it's carrying on

879
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,679
work that the iab had done in the past

880
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,240
um

881
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,360
but trying to build on that

882
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,240
um and find ways that we can come to

883
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,120
more

884
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
technical recommendations to the ietf

885
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,559
for how we

886
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,840
ensure that the protocols we're

887
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,720
developing um

888
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,399
have good properties around these

889
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,000
aspects um and

890
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,559
one administrative change here is that

891
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,120
uh david scanazzi is now

892
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,799
going to be a co-lead of this program so

893
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,159
hopefully that will

894
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,200
allow us to have still better output and

895
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,440
uh more energy in this so david do you

896
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,760
want to introduce yourself

897
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,399
absolutely so hi everyone i'm david

898
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,399
scanazzi and i'm very excited to be

899
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,080
working on electronic dance music here

900
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,279
with the iab

901
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,720
back to you tommy

902
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,399
i love it all right next slide please

903
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,320
um so just some details here

904
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
we do have a github where um you can see

905
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,600
some of the issues we're

906
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,519
thinking about it's at that link and

907
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,960
the document that we're currently

908
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,480
talking most about is actually one that

909
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,120
existed

910
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,240
prior to this program being created

911
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,559
but we think is a very important work

912
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,000
item that we want to progress

913
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,799
that martin thompson began it's the

914
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,200
draft use it or lose it

915
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
and we've met now twice we had our last

916
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,720
call in december

917
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,799
and we're going to plan a new call for

918
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,000
sometime in april

919
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,399
um right now so far we've gone on a

920
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,679
cadence of

921
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,320
you know roughly as often as the ietf

922
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,039
meetings

923
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,200
um they're just slightly delayed next

924
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,679
slide please

925
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
so at the last meeting one of the major

926
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,360
topics we covered was

927
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,679
just looking at what are the mechanisms

928
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,159
that we're doing for protocol extensions

929
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,599
and are there things that

930
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,440
we could add as notes to the user elucid

931
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,639
draft and one of the

932
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,199
topics here was looking at the relative

933
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:21,918
success

934
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,719
and um

935
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,639
how ossified we see things when we're

936
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,679
using something that's like a proper

937
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,800
version negotiation

938
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,280
versus just extending a protocol one of

939
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,399
the

940
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,159
observations in the document is that you

941
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,280
want to be able to use

942
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,879
an extension point often and

943
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,320
that is the best way to ensure it does

944
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,639
not ossify but

945
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,879
version negotiation specifically is

946
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,839
something that

947
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,280
can get used very infrequently

948
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,040
and especially is not being used when

949
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,399
you first deploy

950
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,040
a new protocol and so we were noting

951
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,920
that

952
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,839
actually some of the most successful

953
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,320
cases of this is when a protocol

954
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
has this version negotiation in some

955
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,320
other protocols

956
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,680
extension point for example http using

957
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,560
um the alpn which is just a tls

958
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,200
extension which is a very well

959
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,520
greased and well understood extension

960
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,359
point

961
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,400
um we also discussed some anti-patterns

962
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,240
like how we see that the iip itself

963
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,599
has a version field that really is often

964
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,000
not used and you need to have

965
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,119
some encapsulating protocol like the

966
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,240
ether type

967
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,560
actually determine what is the protocol

968
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,400
version so we have a lot of redundant

969
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,760
version indicators in that case so we

970
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,200
have some initial

971
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,760
text that was added to the document

972
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,200
based on this but we're going to

973
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,560
continue to refine that and go further

974
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,839
next slide please

975
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,359
and there's also areas that we noted

976
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,440
that you know we are still

977
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,760
uh learning about there are ongoing

978
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,839
essentially experiments

979
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,320
particularly in what quick is doing and

980
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,079
the experience we're having in tls and

981
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,440
http

982
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,680
quick is one of the kind of first

983
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,040
protocols like this that's really

984
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,680
defining

985
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,079
a strong notion of invariance that will

986
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,839
last across multiple versions going to

987
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,880
the future

988
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
we haven't deployed those other versions

989
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
yet so we're going to have to see how

990
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
that works out

991
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
[Music]

992
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,040
greasing is also something that's done a

993
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,560
lot already in tls

994
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,839
it's something that we can do in quick

995
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,200
and we're talking about doing more in

996
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,880
http

997
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,680
and this is an area again where we'd

998
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,320
like to have

999
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,800
advice on this but we're also still

1000
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,640
gathering information

1001
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,920
and particularly one of the interesting

1002
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,560
areas for greasing is

1003
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,920
talking about how we can coordinate this

1004
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,760
um a lot of the discussion we had

1005
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,440
indicates that

1006
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,720
really the strength that we have from

1007
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,760
trying to exercise code points is not

1008
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,720
just in doing

1009
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,040
random things um through completely

1010
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,480
random greasing but really

1011
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,000
coordinating an effort between different

1012
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,599
implementations

1013
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,040
um so that's something that we want to

1014
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,440
further explore in our next meeting

1015
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,800
so if these are interesting topics to

1016
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,640
you please join in

1017
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,160
anyone can join the list and anyone can

1018
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,920
join the meetings

1019
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,359
next slide i think that

1020
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,760
yep so here's the mailing list you can

1021
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,800
join

1022
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,280
um we'll be scheduling a call very soon

1023
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,880
and you can send your thoughts through

1024
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,040
email or github

1025
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,440
elliot

1026
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,040
you are

1027
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,720
great muted problem uh correction uh

1028
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
thanks for the opportunity to comment uh

1029
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
just one quick comment

1030
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
which is i think there's a difference in

1031
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,320
a qualitative difference between

1032
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,599
protocols

1033
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,640
and formats and so

1034
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,839
uh when you look at uh

1035
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,560
each right a protocol you can negotiate

1036
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,079
you can fail fast

1037
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,680
there are all sorts of things you can do

1038
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,720
in a protocol with a

1039
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,839
an object format you have less

1040
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,800
opportunity

1041
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,760
to fail and so you have to look at the

1042
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,599
problem a little differently

1043
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,760
um which is to say uh how do you handle

1044
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,000
backward compatibility and this has

1045
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,800
uh i think plagued uh some of the

1046
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,920
systems that we use

1047
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,240
pretty regularly like uh email and other

1048
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,200
things where

1049
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,720
you really don't want to have to have a

1050
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,560
backward compatibility but then you've

1051
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,200
got that

1052
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,440
one person who's using you know a

1053
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,760
teletype from you know or

1054
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,359
something they bought because they can't

1055
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,440
they can't see they bought it 10

1056
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,800
15 years ago and they're not going to

1057
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,119
replace it so the

1058
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,960
there are some aspects around those

1059
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,040
formats and as you're going through this

1060
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,440
exercise it might be worth just teasing

1061
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,359
out those differences

1062
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,800
that's a really good point yeah and i

1063
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,040
will add a note for that

1064
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,720
on our list of issues to look at thank

1065
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,919
you so much thank you

1066
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,040
okay i will seed the floor thank you

1067
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,520
everyone

1068
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,119
oh i guess we have stewart

1069
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,880
the just a data point really you said ip

1070
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,160
versions weren't used

1071
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,599
actually we use ipv versions to identify

1072
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,520
whether a packet is or isn't

1073
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,480
a an ip packet in the mpls domain and

1074
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:32,800
then

1075
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,359
actually sequester those fields for some

1076
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,440
other internal notations

1077
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,480
so it's not actually correct to pick

1078
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,599
that particular example

1079
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,280
yeah thank you for that note and i i i

1080
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,320
think um the way i was explaining it was

1081
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,079
overly simplified and the text we're

1082
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,280
working on in the document should be

1083
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,160
hopefully uh

1084
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,079
a bit more nuanced of just pointing out

1085
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,160
that there are instances where that

1086
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,200
version field

1087
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,960
could not be fully leveraged not that it

1088
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,880
is never leveraged

1089
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,560
okay you just pick that one and it just

1090
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,160
happens to be used in another protocol

1091
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,480
that was my one of my favorites

1092
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,040
perfect thank you

1093
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:25,839
all right thank you so much

1094
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,440
yeah i think we uh move on with um

1095
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,000
picking up the centralization discussion

1096
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,640
from yesterday basically

1097
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,839
thank you can you share the slides okay

1098
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,920
there we go excellent so um

1099
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,240
this is basically just as noted

1100
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,000
continuing the discussion from from

1101
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,680
yesterday and a little bit of context

1102
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,000
setting and pointers to existing work

1103
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,240
and

1104
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,119
a couple of thoughts about way forward

1105
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,000
or how this

1106
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,440
can be best discussed because the next

1107
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,839
slide please

1108
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,520
so the topics that i think we are

1109
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,720
discussing about

1110
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,440
is um two things really one is what we

1111
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
call centralized service deployment

1112
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,040
which is about

1113
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280
basically providing services by a single

1114
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,240
entity

1115
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,319
rather than doing it in a collaborative

1116
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,520
fashion

1117
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,839
and when i say single entity i don't

1118
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,040
mean that you have

1119
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,119
one server you could be running a

1120
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,319
distributed worldwide

1121
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,079
network but it's still under the control

1122
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,640
of a single administrative domain

1123
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,920
a single company for instance

1124
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,400
and of course the internet is not either

1125
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,960
or

1126
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,040
there's a mixture of things inside the

1127
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,280
internet and some services are

1128
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,599
naturally under single control like you

1129
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,640
know my website

1130
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,200
or alternative dns server you know it's

1131
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,800
their information only one place can

1132
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,280
really

1133
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,920
really provide it other services could

1134
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,319
be

1135
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,240
such that they are fundamentally

1136
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,000
collaborative i think

1137
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,240
packet forwarding might be one example

1138
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,200
here so we have to

1139
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,079
forward to others essentially um and

1140
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,000
there's some service that could be

1141
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,040
um either way

1142
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,280
so that's that's sort of a technical

1143
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,760
thing in in some sense that we we are

1144
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,800
within one one domain or one

1145
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,960
administrative uh entity and then

1146
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,640
there's internet consolidation which is

1147
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,000
more about like

1148
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,040
competition and companies and

1149
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,160
so forth and how many service providers

1150
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,079
we have for particular

1151
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,359
things in the world and how much

1152
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,720
choice do you have as a consumer

1153
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,280
i think the iab heard yesterday has also

1154
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,240
heard before

1155
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,800
a clear message from you all the

1156
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,000
community

1157
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,839
that these topics are important

1158
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,440
centralization is important

1159
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,000
and we should also acknowledge that we

1160
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,319
realize that this is a complex topic

1161
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,040
we realize that it has many parts that

1162
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,599
are not

1163
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,920
technical uh and that there are

1164
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,079
difficult trade-offs and there's various

1165
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,440
viewpoints

1166
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,160
next slide please

1167
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,800
um the question is does it um does it

1168
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,839
actually matter

1169
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:17,440
and uh should we be discussing it and um

1170
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,119
i at least personally think it matters i

1171
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,680
think other people were also saying that

1172
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,359
um so um it can have many impacts and

1173
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:26,880
and sort of important to realize that

1174
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,960
they can be in many directions so so

1175
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,920
first of all

1176
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,720
some of this can be good i think we've

1177
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,359
seen

1178
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,839
some technology adoption stories even

1179
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,040
with uh recent idf technologies where

1180
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,240
the dominance or the ease of large

1181
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,440
entities to switch on

1182
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,280
new technology has actually improved

1183
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,280
things quite a lot

1184
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,359
it's particularly easy if you control

1185
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,560
multiple parties

1186
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,760
in a protocol exchange it's also useful

1187
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,280
sometimes to hide in a crowd

1188
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,240
but there are also serious drawbacks uh

1189
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,440
one is of course

1190
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,839
resilience like if that one big service

1191
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,520
goes down and we've seen this kind of

1192
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,800
thing happen

1193
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,520
occasionally uh then we are in a world

1194
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,720
of hurt

1195
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,400
i think the right architectural response

1196
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,720
is to have uh

1197
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,440
not huge entities but more smaller

1198
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,520
entities collaborating

1199
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,760
it's also issues with interoperability

1200
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,680
ability of new entrants to enter and so

1201
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,960
forth

1202
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,760
one sort of a personally concerning

1203
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,440
issue is also that

1204
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,720
if you have two large entities that have

1205
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,359
a lot of data let's say not just pick a

1206
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,319
random example

1207
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,040
entities that would know the browsing

1208
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,800
histories of people

1209
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,359
for large number of people that's very

1210
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,880
attractive target

1211
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,079
um even if you are you know well-meaning

1212
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,200
you want to do like

1213
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,280
all of us i think in the itf everybody

1214
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,440
who's involved is doing this

1215
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,520
or any of these services and they are

1216
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,400
very good intentions but

1217
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,960
but they are also affected by

1218
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,079
governments and

1219
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,079
shareholders and so on that might be

1220
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,200
asking for for

1221
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,440
access to the data for instance so i

1222
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,000
think we want to avoid that in some ways

1223
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,839
there's of course economics involved i

1224
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,760
won't go into details with that you can

1225
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,880
read some of that and we

1226
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,680
move to the next slide uh so i was

1227
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,319
trying to

1228
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,040
collect a little bit of previously

1229
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,560
published material about this and of

1230
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,839
course

1231
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,839
at least for me it's it's surprising how

1232
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,200
good stuff you're gonna find from the

1233
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,560
old rfcs

1234
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,359
um they were really written uh cleverly

1235
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:34,400
rc1958 for instance talks about

1236
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,839
competitive multi-vendor

1237
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,520
multi-provider public networks 3935

1238
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,480
talks about

1239
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,200
decentralized control it's use user

1240
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,800
empowerment and so forth

1241
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,160
next slide please um i have a

1242
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,480
few other things here i won't go into

1243
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,760
the details of these

1244
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,839
these things uh save time for a

1245
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,520
discussion about

1246
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,119
let's want to point you the internet

1247
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,400
society's global report on consolidation

1248
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,599
and the journal of cyber policy and if

1249
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,240
you click

1250
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,680
one more slide forward so they

1251
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,800
actually published a special issue

1252
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,000
that was sponsored by isaac i don't see

1253
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,400
the next light yet but

1254
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,760
can you move the next slide oh there we

1255
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,480
go

1256
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,839
um so they published an

1257
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,760
issue with consolidation-related

1258
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,839
articles but

1259
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,880
kinds of research or thoughts around

1260
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,000
this topic worth reading

1261
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,760
to take a look and maybe that's enough

1262
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,640
for

1263
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,599
for this past work the point was just to

1264
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,480
say that there's

1265
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,400
quite a lot that's already been written

1266
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,359
about it if you go to the last slide

1267
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,640
where i had a few thoughts about

1268
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,319
how to move forward and i see

1269
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,079
many possibilities for failing to

1270
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,200
discuss this properly

1271
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,839
one is that i think we need to take it

1272
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,520
too hard that this is

1273
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,599
not just important but also this complex

1274
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,640
topic that you can't have like one-sided

1275
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,000
view into it um

1276
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,599
the other thing that we want to avoid is

1277
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,440
that we shouldn't trade

1278
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,280
take the debate to the extremes that

1279
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,359
just because we can't have like fully

1280
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,960
peer-to-peer network with you know

1281
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,520
bitcoin exchanged all over the place

1282
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,880
doesn't mean that we shouldn't do

1283
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,720
anything um

1284
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,319
and the same is true of also like not

1285
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,839
everything's gonna be centralized

1286
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,400
doesn't mean that we shouldn't think

1287
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,040
about it

1288
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,920
each case that we uh come across

1289
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,680
carefully and think about whether that's

1290
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,960
we're doing the right thing or the wrong

1291
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,119
thing um

1292
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,200
the third point is that we should

1293
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,319
actually understand

1294
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,680
this this space and sometimes you get

1295
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,240
this frustration like i i get it that

1296
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,319
well i can't really do much so what what

1297
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,079
should i should i stop

1298
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,920
but i think it's actually useful to

1299
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,280
understand like

1300
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,880
understand the issues understand the

1301
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,400
impacts collect measurement data

1302
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,880
take actual you know stock of you know

1303
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,280
what's what's happening out there

1304
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,960
and and this information can be helpful

1305
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,640
for us but it's also obviously helpful

1306
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,040
for

1307
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,960
for the rest of the society who's also i

1308
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,160
think interested in

1309
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,839
some of the conclusions um

1310
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,920
and finally i i do think there are

1311
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,119
helpful things

1312
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,520
that we can do and if if the goal is

1313
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,079
to have like this magic solution that

1314
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,920
will solve all of these problems

1315
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,599
and i i don't think we should be holding

1316
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,200
our breath

1317
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,559
but um i think there are

1318
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,760
things we could do one example uh is is

1319
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,440
that if you have something where

1320
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,520
you're only using one instance of

1321
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,079
something some technology for instance

1322
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,400
um and that's too centralized or

1323
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,680
consolidated for

1324
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,720
for people's taste then having a way to

1325
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,359
discover

1326
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,839
other places that offer the same service

1327
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,520
can actually be used for i think we've

1328
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,200
done this in the dns space or

1329
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,760
are doing it at least so i think that's

1330
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,240
a

1331
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,319
helpful technique or example of a

1332
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,200
helpful technique

1333
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,640
um and i think that's it uh from my side

1334
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:10,880
i

1335
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,640
don't know if the other people from iab

1336
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,160
have been thinking about it or not

1337
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
provide their thoughts or or anybody

1338
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,880
else for that matter

1339
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,160
in the in the working group

1340
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,640
speak up

1341
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,839
yeah i i would like to add one point

1342
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,760
and that tommy made yesterday and

1343
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,440
probably he's much better in making his

1344
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,960
point herself um but i think it's also

1345
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,160
that like we can not necessarily push

1346
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,440
somebody to adopt a certain um

1347
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,720
technique just because they think we

1348
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,400
think it's like it's it's better for the

1349
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,200
internet

1350
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,079
i think deployment is always driven by

1351
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,920
uh you know what's the benefits that a

1352
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,880
solution provides

1353
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,839
uh what's the cheapest solution what's

1354
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:58,240
more

1355
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,599
easy easier to deploy solution and so on

1356
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,119
so with that we probably have to keep in

1357
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,640
mind this when we design our

1358
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,240
protocols and also make sure that

1359
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,839
those solutions that we design and that

1360
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,839
we favor are the ones that can be easily

1361
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,599
adopted

1362
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,200
but i think tommy made this point

1363
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,880
somehow much better or maybe i'm

1364
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:19,599
misinterpreting

1365
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,000
i don't know

1366
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,400
yeah thank you elliot i think you're

1367
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,640
next

1368
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,760
that i'm still having some permissions

1369
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,040
issues hey uh

1370
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,000
thanks yari uh this is good work and uh

1371
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,280
i think it's something that's been

1372
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:43,839
around

1373
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,240
everybody's um it's been in people's

1374
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,440
minds for a while

1375
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,599
um i think i wanna once again

1376
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,960
acknowledge uh

1377
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,720
even early comments that mark nottingham

1378
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,480
made on

1379
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,280
on this in an ied plenary going although

1380
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,680
going way back to 2014 or so

1381
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,720
um the two points i wanted to make is

1382
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,000
that uh first of all um

1383
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,520
i i do think there are

1384
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,400
times when we should be thinking about

1385
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:14,880
these

1386
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,920
aspects architecturally

1387
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,319
not and as they apply to our protocol

1388
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,119
suite

1389
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,319
perhaps one of the most egregious

1390
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,599
aspects of private networking

1391
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,280
is that it forces a form of

1392
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,640
concentration in that

1393
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,720
endpoints are all but prohibited

1394
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,319
from offering services without

1395
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,400
intermediaries this is something that

1396
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,680
um i raised early on as far back as 1994

1397
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,040
as a concern with with the

1398
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,319
private network addresses um so uh

1399
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,359
this is a problem that can recur and i

1400
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:56,960
think martin has written

1401
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,000
uh eloquently on on the

1402
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,480
value and use and perhaps risks of

1403
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,119
intermediaries and that comes into this

1404
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,240
discussion

1405
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,280
the second point is uh

1406
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,559
that i wanted to agree with you about

1407
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,960
just how complex a problem this is one

1408
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,760
can easily

1409
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,839
argue that mail services these days

1410
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,240
are considerably more reliable than

1411
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,440
they've ever

1412
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,119
ever been because the there's not only

1413
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:31,040
concentration of service providers but

1414
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,280
there's a concentration of expertise

1415
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,640
who then know how to scale these

1416
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,720
services which is really good

1417
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,079
the problem is when one of these

1418
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:40,400
providers fails the damage is

1419
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,599
considerable

1420
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,240
and we just saw a good example of that

1421
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,520
outside of the

1422
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,760
health mail environment over the last

1423
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:48,720
few days with

1424
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,839
one particular um

1425
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,760
offering where they they took out you

1426
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,160
know there was a risk that hit

1427
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,760
many thousands of businesses so

1428
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,160
it's very uh one of the things we should

1429
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,280
be thinking about

1430
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,119
in terms of resolving this by the way is

1431
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,720
can standards play a role

1432
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,119
can open standards uh or open guidance

1433
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,520
uh open up interfaces today that are in

1434
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,040
fact closed

1435
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:18,240
uh that might improve uh the the

1436
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,599
uh environment in terms of the risks of

1437
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,079
resiliency that we face all right thanks

1438
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,839
very much

1439
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:29,440
thanks so much quickly want to uh

1440
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
say that we will close the queue very

1441
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,200
soon because we have now a huge

1442
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,400
number of people in the queue and only

1443
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,160
eight minutes seven minutes left so if

1444
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,680
you want to say something jump into the

1445
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,960
queue now and we'll be close in 10

1446
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,040
seconds

1447
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,920
keith your next one

1448
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,760
so purely questions um

1449
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,520
one thing and maybe i missed it at the

1450
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,960
top is

1451
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,280
where can folks get more involved in the

1452
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,640
discussion

1453
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,760
um and participate in this discussion

1454
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,400
because i think you know this is one of

1455
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,440
my things too

1456
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,200
i think a lot of people care about this

1457
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,480
one um

1458
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,480
and would like to figure out how to give

1459
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,760
input the other

1460
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,040
is um does the iab

1461
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,079
have any good levers to pull to

1462
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,520
to actually not just work against this

1463
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,000
but

1464
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,599
just deal with it whether it's work

1465
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,520
against it or say

1466
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,280
this is looking like it's centralizing

1467
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,960
and maybe it's good maybe it's bad

1468
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,000
and we have to examine and you know how

1469
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,839
might those levers affect

1470
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,640
ietf work how might they affect other

1471
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,359
work

1472
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,359
i'm just trying to get my head around

1473
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,550
how this is going to

1474
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:42,160
[Music]

1475
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,640
be useful discussion other than just

1476
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,400
shouting at clouds which some of us love

1477
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,559
to do anyway

1478
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,880
yeah i'm looking for my decentralized

1479
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,000
button but i can't find

1480
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,400
it right now i i think the only lever

1481
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,359
that we have is

1482
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,040
is information and educating people

1483
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,680
and with regards to where to discuss

1484
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,079
this

1485
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,920
i think yesterday somebody suggested

1486
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,520
that we should organize a workshop

1487
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,119
that's a possibility

1488
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,880
but we actually had workshops in this

1489
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,280
space and so that was in the slides

1490
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,400
um so i don't know if that's the right

1491
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,079
answer but definitely architecture

1492
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,599
discuss is one place where we can

1493
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,359
discuss this

1494
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,119
it would be nice to have something more

1495
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,680
ongoing than a workshop i mean i think

1496
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,160
workshops are great um and they always

1497
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,520
produce great output

1498
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,119
but this seems like such a big topic

1499
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,079
that having something more long-lived

1500
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,040
that the iab was running would be great

1501
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,920
okay

1502
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,200
we'll take that point on the

1503
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,760
consideration thank you

1504
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,240
andrew

1505
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,400
oh yeah uh well thank you for covering

1506
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,359
it uh

1507
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,079
again so briefly but but thoroughly uh

1508
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:50,960
yarry

1509
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,920
um i i just would debate two points you

1510
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,280
touched on the fact there could be some

1511
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,319
benefits to

1512
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,119
uh users from uh centralization and you

1513
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:00,640
mentioned some of them like the sort of

1514
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,960
qriket operating standards etc i think i

1515
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,480
would argue that

1516
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,400
that's unlikely to be true over the long

1517
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,400
term so yes there might be some

1518
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,520
short-term gains

1519
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,040
but i think long-term uh yeah privacy

1520
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,480
resilience etc is toast

1521
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,440
um i don't see how the there's it's in

1522
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,440
the long term interest of of users

1523
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,280
uh you know even if it means that ipv6

1524
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,119
gets adopted more quickly

1525
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,480
uh yeah but all of my uh personal data

1526
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,799
uh is now available on the dark web

1527
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,160
feels like a bad

1528
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,040
trade-off um over the long term so i

1529
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:35,599
think

1530
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,160
long term i question if there are any

1531
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,079
meaningful gains

1532
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,680
from it um and in terms of

1533
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,760
so what to do about it i do think that

1534
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,799
there needs to be the ability to review

1535
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:54,000
and challenge some new protocols etc

1536
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,240
before they're they're allowed through

1537
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,599
the standards

1538
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,480
to see if uh if they do make the problem

1539
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,440
worse

1540
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,599
um and pick you up on a point that tommy

1541
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,119
made very

1542
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,599
very well yesterday um and maybe

1543
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,280
intervene to improve them

1544
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,280
um to try and allow for those

1545
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,119
significant negative side effects to be

1546
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,359
ameliorated in in some way

1547
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,520
but uh yeah otherwise i think this is

1548
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,599
just a disaster

1549
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,119
for the end user and completely against

1550
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:25,359
rfc8890

1551
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:30,558
thanks thank you dominique

1552
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,000
thanks yeah and i just want to thank you

1553
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,960
yuri for

1554
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,280
for highlighting the complexity and the

1555
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,640
different issues of

1556
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,200
involved in this because it is social

1557
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,079
political

1558
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,480
economic it's it's market-based it's

1559
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,200
technical

1560
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,520
it's it's very complicated and i really

1561
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,880
appreciate that

1562
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,440
all i want to say is um i just support

1563
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,640
pete's idea

1564
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,520
about um doing something that's iab

1565
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,480
sponsored

1566
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,880
um you know maybe using the workshop as

1567
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,640
a jumping off point but i think it would

1568
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,240
be great to kind of

1569
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,720
have a discussion ongoing discussion at

1570
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,920
least for a little while

1571
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,160
even though ones have already happened

1572
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,480
in the past it's a perfect time right

1573
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:10,880
now

1574
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,599
so i'm looking for that to the iab for

1575
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,079
some

1576
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,280
some ideas so thanks okay

1577
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,559
point taken thank you david

1578
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,480
hi david schnazzy iab um so first off i

1579
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,280
want to say that

1580
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,960
i agree that this is a complex topic

1581
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,559
that is important like

1582
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:30,480
to say and i agree that too much

1583
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,079
centralization is bad

1584
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,520
absolutely that said i'm

1585
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,720
very confused as to what the iab or the

1586
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,040
larger scale the ietf community can do

1587
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,599
here

1588
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,480
because we are not the protocol police

1589
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,200
we

1590
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,839
are not legislators uh so

1591
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:51,440
if what is the outcome here if we are

1592
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,960
gonna if we write an rfc that says

1593
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,720
centralization is bad

1594
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,040
that's not gonna change the needle a bit

1595
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,920
if we

1596
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,960
um go and have a workshop and say why is

1597
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,280
centralization bad because a b and c

1598
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,880
i don't see that as moving the needle

1599
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,040
either so while i think this is an

1600
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,240
important topic

1601
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,559
i kind of see it as out of scope for the

1602
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,319
itf in general

1603
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,799
all we can do to make sure we don't

1604
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:16,839
encourage

1605
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,200
um centralization is to make sure our

1606
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,400
protocols are open

1607
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,720
and extensible so anyone can do anything

1608
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,319
they want with them but that's been in

1609
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:25,440
our ethos

1610
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,520
since the beginning so i'm not sure

1611
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,880
there's much more to be done

1612
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,480
from us here yeah

1613
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,960
your point is valid i think uh and i i

1614
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,680
think that

1615
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,839
probably implies that that we can't have

1616
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,839
like this you know broad statements that

1617
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:40,799
you know is bad

1618
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,920
that good but it puts more pointed

1619
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,040
advice that here

1620
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,480
are techniques that can help in this

1621
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,160
situation thank you uh martin

1622
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,000
yeah so um um

1623
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,720
just to reply because a couple people

1624
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,640
mentioned

1625
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,799
what i had said of plenary with regards

1626
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,599
to this i just want to clarify that

1627
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,520
i very much agree with what david said

1628
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,839
like we cannot be a protocol police

1629
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,440
here um but that we should be just

1630
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,400
focusing on promoting protocols that

1631
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,920
allow

1632
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,119
um distributed

1633
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,200
and non-centralized ways of doing things

1634
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,480
and i think there are positive things we

1635
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,680
can do

1636
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,520
but we should not be focusing at all on

1637
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,839
trenton forgiveness

1638
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,880
thank you yeah so i i share the concerns

1639
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,720
a lot of people about centralization

1640
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,880
in many oh by the way martin duke f5 and

1641
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,839
iesg

1642
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,720
um i i do share the concerns a lot of

1643
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,760
people have about

1644
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,280
centralization in many aspects of the

1645
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,119
way the internet works um

1646
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,799
i i do think that the work of creating

1647
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,680
interoperable standards is inherently

1648
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,240
decentralizing um because you know they

1649
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,119
allow

1650
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,720
you to switch out the vendors for things

1651
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,200
very quite basically i i do

1652
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,280
in my non-expert opinion centralization

1653
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,440
is largely regulatory and and legal

1654
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,319
problem

1655
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,640
and i remain a little skeptical that the

1656
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,720
itf has the levers i mean you mentioned

1657
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,400
one thing here which is the client-side

1658
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,200
discovery

1659
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,960
we do things like add which i think our

1660
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,400
effort to address that

1661
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,119
um i think we've been doing discovery

1662
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,040
techniques for for a long time

1663
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,520
um but i i have trouble seeing the

1664
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,960
letters that ietf has

1665
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,040
to to move the ball forward on this

1666
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,640
thanks

1667
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,000
all right and then ecker

1668
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,319
the last word yeah i mean david and

1669
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:33,599
martin said a number of things that i

1670
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,160
would say

1671
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,440
um i guess you know i

1672
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,640
i think it's important distinguish

1673
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,240
between things which are um you know

1674
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,000
inherently centralizing and being

1675
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,599
uh in terms of technology and things

1676
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,520
which are not so i mean

1677
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,880
like let's take the web which is like

1678
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,319
inherently decentralized technology like

1679
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:49,920
you could have as many websites you want

1680
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,880
you can have you know

1681
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,079
like people like other websites et

1682
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,160
cetera and yet when you look at how

1683
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,079
the web practice gets deployed you know

1684
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,599
it's almost impractical to run any

1685
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:58,240
substantial

1686
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,760
site uh having using aws or using a cdn

1687
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,240
or hosting or having hosted for you and

1688
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,240
so here we have a situation where

1689
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,680
there is a nominally decentralized

1690
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,760
system that is tentatively decentralized

1691
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,440
and yet there are powerful economic and

1692
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,200
technical reasons why it gets shoved

1693
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,799
into a very small number of boxes

1694
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,920
and so the extent to which you know

1695
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,079
you might ask the idf to design the

1696
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,280
system differently but like what would

1697
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:21,839
you have done

1698
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:22,559
what are you doing to make that

1699
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:24,880
inherently less centralized and so if

1700
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,280
you know

1701
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,480
if we want to do something meaningful

1702
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,640
here then we have to ask is what are the

1703
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,160
technical functions that would

1704
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,720
reverse the incentives towards taking

1705
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,400
things which are nominally decentralized

1706
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,760
and actually centralizing them

1707
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,000
and i think there's a really big open

1708
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,520
question i think um there's been a lot

1709
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,039
of work on it frankly a lot of which i

1710
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,400
don't think works super well

1711
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,640
um and it isn't as persuasive hope but i

1712
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,079
think those are the those are the

1713
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,559
anchors that um you know or are the the

1714
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,160
levers that we have to pull if there are

1715
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,640
any

1716
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,000
um and i think uh um you know um

1717
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,680
our rfcs or blog posts about hazard

1718
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,200
realization is bad will not

1719
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,480
it will not have much of an impact

1720
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,880
thank you okay

1721
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,000
okay says uh

1722
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,039
mira do you have any other word

1723
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,440
no so unfortunately we have no time left

1724
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,319
for any other

1725
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:21,039
open mic um but feel free to send an

1726
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:21,920
email to ib

1727
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,000
ib.org if you want to tell us something

1728
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,359
or have a conversation with us

1729
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:27,039
i think this conversation can go to the

1730
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,039
architecture discuss list

1731
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,319
and we can i can keep discussing there

1732
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:33,920
and with that i think we're done sorry

1733
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,440
for going overtime for a few minutes i

1734
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,480
hope you enjoyed it anyway

1735
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,480
okay thanks thanks very much i want to

1736
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,119
serve the

1737
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,480
attention to the ib work okay so that's

1738
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,799
all for the meeting thank you see you

1739
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,359
next time

1740
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:59,839
bye
