this session is being recorded so it

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,040
will be available like all the other map

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,520
rg

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,920
presentations afterwards on the map rg

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
wiki if you search map rg wiki

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,040
at google you'll find it and

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
there's an index to each individual

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
presentation here's the irtf

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
notewell it's the same as the ietf noel

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,759
essentially

33
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
uh but be aware that speaking about your

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,600
work here has potentially consequences

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,119
having to do with intellectual property

36
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,360
and

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
familiarize yourself with that here's

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
the

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,318
irtf privacy and code of conduct

40
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,879
behavior yourselves you always seem to

41
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
but look at that if you need to know

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,560
anything

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,520
about the details here's a slide about

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
the goals of the irtf

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
for those of you new to it and i think

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,319
maybe you have a couple speakers that

47
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,760
haven't visited us before

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,000
on the irtf conducts research it's not

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
bound by the same rules as the ietf but

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,319
we

51
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,120
largely focus on uh research that has to

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
do with ietf things and we happen to be

53
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,080
co-located or coincidentally with the

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
itf

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
administrivia you can find our charter

56
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,200
online

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
uh i usually search for mrg at google

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,239
and that comes up

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,840
there we have a mailing list if you want

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
to stick with us in the future

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,760
today's slides are not at meeting 105

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
they're at meeting 110

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,080
so i'll fix that in the slides the media

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,959

68
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,440
screen

69
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
out loud

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319

about 10 minutes talking about

75
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,200
collecting typical domain names for web

76
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,000
servers

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
and if you look at the agenda link in on

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,280
the website

paper is also there

87

um for a 15-minute research presentation

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,239
again about the dns and tls and some

89
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,280
measurement results

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,760
we'll switch to fong for assessing the

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,480
privacy

92
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,080
benefits of the of domain name

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
encryption that is also

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,920

but

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,879
we're going to try to fit the questions

107
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
and comments in between those or in the

108
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,680

all right so i'm going to share preview

171
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,719
i'm sorry um

172
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
there we go i've got beautiful thanks 37

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
minutes after the hour so i'll let you

174
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:27,919
know

175
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,280
when there's about nine minutes up if

176
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,120
you have not finished by then go ahead

177
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,880
and and i'm gonna zip through this

178
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,840
quickly um so greetings um

179
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,919
uh my name is paul hoffman i work for

180
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,560
icann this was work that was i did

181
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
under the auspices of icann but it was

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,479
actually initiated for the deprived

183
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,720
working group in the ietf so

184
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,280
next slide

185
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
so the motivation for this work was that

186
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,599
in the dns a lot of people

187
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,039
when they're doing um uh research on

188
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,960
like authoritative servers and such like

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,240
that

190
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,039
they want to to collect data from a lot

191
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:07,599
of

192
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
authoritative servers i'm going down and

193
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,520
up again but that happens um

194
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,800
and uh typically what people do

195
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
is they use um one of

196
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,479
the lists of the most popular you know

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,319
servers out there so like the alexa list

198
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,840
or the tranco list and such like that

199
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,000
um but those aren't typical

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,199
and uh the the request from

201
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
dprive was actually we were trying to

202
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,559
measure uh

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,919
the um how long it takes to set up a tls

204
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,559
connection on a typical web server

205
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,320
turns out we didn't end up using using

206
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,839
the research but it was fun to do

207
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,680
anyways

208
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
so the kinds of lists that people use

209
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
like i say are the most popular websites

210
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,279
and if you don't know about tranco you

211
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
should definitely look at the old map rg

212
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,920
slides on that

213
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,720
um the other one that people use is they

214
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,440
extract

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
um that that all of the gtlds the the

216
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,440
global

217
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
top level domains um

218
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,279
i'm sorry generic top-level domains

219
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,399
those are available

220
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,640
those lists of the domain names however

221
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
a bazillion of those are just parked

222
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
so they're not really typical either or

223
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,519
they get a dump from a passive dns

224
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,800
collection system

225
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
but that's not really typical because

226
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,959
those are often very local that is

227
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,519
you know for a recursive resolver in a

228
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,120
particular region it's going to be much

229
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,839
more regional

230
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,399
next slide

231
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,640
um so what i also just realized is that

232
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,480
wow wikipedia has

233
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,240
links to um a bazillion

234
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,160
small websites you know if you're if

235
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,839
you're reading the wikipedia page

236
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,279
you will see things like um

237
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,120
uh personal websites of academics and

238
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
lists of all of the elementary schools

239
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,240
in a particular

240
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
town in a country you've never visited

241
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,360
and such like that

242
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,680
um and also the nice thing is wikipedia

243
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,360
is not just in english that's in

244
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
um pretty much every spoken language in

245
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
the world

246
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,839
so uh this is these are examples of the

247
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,519
kinds of things that as i was looking i

248
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,800
was like oh this is great

249
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
these are much more typical than a list

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,000
of

251
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,079
the largest websites around you get

252
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
governments of small cities obscure

253
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
support teams things like that

254
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,240
so um the question was well great

255
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,880
without

256
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
scraping all of wikipedia could i get a

257
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
sample of these

258
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,079
next slide

259
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,640
um it turns out that they actually keep

260
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,519
a database

261
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,079
uh twice a month as backups a public

262
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:38,959
database

263
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,560
they want people backing up wikipedia um

264
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,240
basically to mirror it not so that

265
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,920
you're serving it but in case they go

266
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,279
down and such like that

267
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,320
and instead of them just having all of

268
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
the pages as one giant hunk

269
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,120
they actually have pages and some

270
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
subsets and one of them is

271
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
the list of all the external links so

272
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
that was perfect i grabbed that

273
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,560
for the research i did here i did that

274
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
at the beginning of this year

275
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
they updated it seems like twice a month

276
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
on the first of the month and then

277
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,920
sometime towards the middle so grab the

278
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,720
database

279
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
extract all the external links because

280
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
it's actually a database it's a mysql

281
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
database

282
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,079
clean up the lists because

283
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,480
wikipedia it being publicly edited

284
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,519
you have lots of broken links links that

285
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,959
just in fact don't make sense

286
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,279
and that's okay you know like not not

287
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
dunking on wikipedia at all

288
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,760
it's a lovely resource um picked out all

289
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
the ones that in this case were for http

290
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,800
https

291
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
which turned out to be the vast majority

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
of all of the links um can you scroll

293
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,160
down or keep it as a full screen

294
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,120
i can't that i wouldn't that's fine i'm

295
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
going to turn my mic back out so i can

296
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,959
see

297
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,800
no i'm thank you i'll bring it i'll

298
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,399
bring it back up to full screen

299
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,839
no no that's what's done that's fine i'm

300
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,200
just flying by the way so

301
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,000
um so and then because what i was

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,720
looking at

303
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,959
is um just web servers i didn't care

304
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
about the full url

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,480
i um stripped off the scheme

306
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
and everything after the domain name

307
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
which means i didn't know

308
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
which ones that had been listed as htp

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,279
or https

310
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,560
but that's okay because one of the

311
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,320
things we wanted to

312
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
see is if you're hitting on a a web

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
server that actually doesn't have https

314
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
how long will it take for you to find

315
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,839
out and such like that so what what this

316
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,480
gave me

317
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,680
was a list of all the domain names um

318
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,560
for all the links

319
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
and then i had to call the list because

320
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
of course there was a lot of duplication

321
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,760
a million things point back to um

322
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,040
sites like google or for example for a

323
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,320
large university

324
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
there might be you know thousands of

325
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,839
links next slide

326
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,160
so after i did all of that and again i

327
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,680
did this for january first there were

328
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,519
about 750 databases

329
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
i got about 7.35 million unique

330
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,639
domain names from the data set so that

331
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
was lovely and way more than i wanted so

332
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
i took a random sample of a hundred

333
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,120
thousand

334
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
um but so the good news is if you

335
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
want millions of unique domain names

336
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,839
uh to sample from this works just great

337
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,560
um um so and i wanted to test a hundred

338
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,600
thousand hosts

339
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,959
uh but many of the names in there are

340
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,519
dead

341
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,279
so i actually started with over a

342
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,120
hundred thousand um

343
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,360
and resolved them all so i found out

344
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,320
which ones actually

345
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,639
currently have an ipv4 address so i

346
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,240
think i started 150

347
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,480
and then 150 000 and ended up with about

348
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
110 000.

349
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
um and then i did the actual analysis

350
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,920
that i was

351
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
doing which was uh timing but i also

352
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,920
wanted to look just because everyone in

353
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,720
the ietf says how are we doing with ipv6

354
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,800
um and how well you know for those of us

355
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,959
in the dns world how many were dns

356
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:57,360
signed

357
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
so i did that analysis as i was doing

358
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,639
that's not important to this

359
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
presentation basically the presentations

360
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,880
about

361
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,880
hey look i found a new data set you can

362
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,360
find it too next slide

363
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
okay paul you got about two minutes yeah

364
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,560
and that's fine

365
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,600
i'm uh so this is the last slide so

366
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,480
if this interests you please take a look

367
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,880
at

368
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,560
this report it's called the same as this

369
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,440
one collecting

370
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
typical domain names from the web we

371
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,120
have our own

372
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,360
series in icann called the octo series

373
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,199
which is the office of the cto

374
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,079
which is what i'm in so there's an octo

375
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:32,560
number

376
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,839
um of of that um

377
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,720
and i don't actually give the code in

378
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,560
there because as someone pointed out

379
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,399
maybe wikipedia doesn't want is pulling

380
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,160
down the databases all the time and such

381
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,720
like that

382
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,240
but if you're interested in doing this

383
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
work please get in touch with me

384
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,920
um i do have a github repo that i just

385
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
haven't widely publicized

386
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,199
um for the steps i took which is a bunch

387
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,760
of

388
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,079
you know vaguely commented python code

389
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,199
but it actually

390
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,480
is reproducible so that's it um i guess

391
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,720
if

392
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,320
for those of you who care about the dns

393
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,839
and ipv6

394
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,360
um about 17 of the

395
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
of those domain names that had a v4

396
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
address also had a v6 address

397
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
and for those of you who care about dns

398
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,959
sec um

399
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,040
approximately four percent of those

400
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,959
domain names were dnsec

401
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,160
signed so great um and i guess we're not

402
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,760
doing questions right we're just

403
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,560
moving on yeah we are we have time i see

404
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,120
you okay

405
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,959
great so i think we've got i think we've

406
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,480
got about two minutes

407
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,759
okay great absolutely yep um

408
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,360
excuse me for shutting the slide down

409
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,199
but i can't no that's fine that's right

410
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,199
and the slides are available so yeah

411
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,000
yeah so so

412
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
uh for participants put yourself in the

413
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,600
queue um

414
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
if you if you're interested in speaking

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,399
or submit to something to jabber and

416
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,160
here you can relay it so we've got

417
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,120
alexander in the queue

418
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
thank you thanks paulo um alex mayor

419
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,040
from liquidity

420
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
i was wondering did you also consider

421
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
certificate transparency as a sort of

422
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,360
domain name because i i found that's

423
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,959
very interesting as well

424
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,720
so that's a very interesting question no

425
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,959
i didn't but then last week i did

426
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,120
all of a sudden someone had said oh but

427
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,600
there's every certificate you want in ct

428
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
so i will probably rerun this at some

429
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,959
point um

430
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,880
and see whether those numbers are any

431
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,800
different but no i didn't at the time

432
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,079
cool i like that it's always good to

433
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,360
know about another data source that's

434
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
differently biased than all the other

435
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,839
ones that we use

436
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,240
i i wonder if also it'd be interesting

437
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,040
to see after

438
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,480
a time how many stale names are in the

439
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
wikipedia and they might be able to use

440
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,480
that for some of their

441
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
update driving they actually don't do

442
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,800
automatic updates which i think is is

443
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,720
fine i mean they're really reliant on

444
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
volunteers and i think that

445
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,519
that's really good um uh and

446
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,079
the other thing to to note here is that

447
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,759
this is not meant to be a

448
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
typical of the web data it's more

449
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
typical for example

450
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,480
all of us uh probably in the last month

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,760
have ordered out from

452
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,319
a small local restaurant uh that had a

453
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,039
website

454
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,640
that is not in wikipedia there's

455
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,240
probably millions of those

456
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,480
so okay we got oliver in the queue why

457
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,520
don't you go quick

458
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,799
and we'll close the queue then yeah sure

459
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
um so this is oliver i have a question

460
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,839
so basically initially you started with

461
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,640
um the assumption that the top lists out

462
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,400
there are not really representative

463
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,520
did you also basically compare the data

464
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
set that you gathered from wikipedia

465
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
with the one that what you got from

466
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,600
definitely okay yep and so if you look

467
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,880
at the report you'll see that

468
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
um so very briefly ipv6

469
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,080
um adoption was almost identical between

470
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120
tranco and um and this

471
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,880
uh dns second option was actually so i

472
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
remember i said was four percent for

473
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,480
this list it's about two percent

474
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,960
for the tranco list so um that to me

475
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
says that's a huge

476
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,960
difference that shows that in fact um

477
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,840
well-managed

478
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,720
popular uh websites are less likely to

479
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,360
use dns sect than typical

480
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,919
cool thanks thanks a lot guys um thanks

481
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,480

482
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,400
thank you let's bring let's bring via up

483
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,840
and viet uh you got a 15 minute slot in

484
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440

485
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,360
so i'm going to start the countdown

486
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,480
clock

and i'll let you know uh when there's

488

name is viet and i've

491
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,720
been honored to present our paper called

492
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,320
measuring dean s over t less from the

493
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,679
edge

494
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
here at today's memory meeting so as

495
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,080
they've mentioned this paper which was

496
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
co-authored by irena and viper who have

497
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,640
also

498
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200

details

503
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,120
on the paper is covered in this talk on

504
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,160
the github repository linked here

505
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,440
so first of all a brief overview of the

506
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,960
main findings right away

507
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
so as the title of the paper suggests we

508
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,559
will be looking at the adoption

509
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
reliability and response times of dns

510
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,360
over

511
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,880
tls or dot for short so during the talk

512
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,880
we will see that the adoption

513
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,840
of the dot is still rather low and that

514
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,840
we have higher fader rates and response

515
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,880
times for dot

516
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,840
as one may expect compared to

517
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,120
traditional dns but

518
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,919
we'll get back to these results at the

519
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,679
end of the talk again so

520
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,720
we will move on and um

521
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
as most of you likely also know dot was

522
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
standardized

523
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,840
in may 2016 so roughly five years ago

524
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,600
and its main feature is that it provides

525
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,919
confidentiality by securing the dns

526
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:54,799
traffic

527
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,520
with a tls session between the dns

528
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,679
client and the resolver

529
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,159
now previous measurement studies have

530
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,760
already looked at different aspects of

531
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,640
dot

532
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,960
and have measured dot from different

533
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
networks and vantage points

534
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,280
um however not from home networks which

535
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,159
is what

536
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,000
we were interested in and so we were

537
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,159
wondering how does dot look from home

538
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,640
networks

539
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,200
in order to find this out we kind of

540
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,480
split our measurement and

541
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
study in two parts and part one in this

542
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,600
case is the

543
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,240
adoption and before looking into home

544
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,840
networks in particular

545
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,520
we reproduced the first study that we

546
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,679
just referenced in which the authors

547
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,080
have

548
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,400
scanned the pv4 address space for open

549
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,840
dns resolvers

550
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,960
and then subsequently checked the open

551
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,120
ipad points that they found

552
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
for dot support and as of april 2019

553
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,679
this was at

554
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,280
point 15 roughly so we repeated this

555
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
management approach

556
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,840
and found that the number of

557
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,520
open dlt resolvers has actually

558
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,480
increased by roughly 23 percent

559
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
over the course of nine months and that

560
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,720
also the support for

561
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,840
um the new tls 1.3 has also

562
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,159
substantially increased among these open

563
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,039
resolvers

564
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,120
whereas on the flip side um the support

565
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,559
for older versions like pls 1 or tls 1.1

566
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
the support for those has been also

567
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,400
increasingly discontinued

568
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,440
so overall we have find some

569
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,919
decent progress regarding the support of

570
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,799
dot

571
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,360
and newer tls versions although overall

572
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,480
the

573
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,000
adoption is still somewhat low

574
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
then for the second part of the

575
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,120
methodology

576
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,720
this concerns the reliability and

577
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,799
response times we use

578
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,520
the drive atlas platform for

579
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,640
measurements

580
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,159
and this platform has been able to

581
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,960
run dot measurements since early 2018

582
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
roughly

583
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,120
so we reached out to wrap in cc and they

584
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,640
kindly helped us with our measurement

585
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
study in which we involve

586
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,480
around 3 000 residential probes

587
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,880
all of which are ipv4 capable and

588
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,840
version 3

589
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,039
ipadless probes in this case so what

590
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,799
these probes do is they

591
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,440
issue dns requests once a day over a

592
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
period of one week

593
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,159
this was in july 2019 and they do these

594
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,000
requests both over dot

595
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,120
and traditional dns over udp

596
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,000
on port 53 and these dnrs requests

597
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,960
kind of request a record resolution for

598
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,520
200 domains over ipv4

599
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,480
towards a set of 15 different public

600
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,320
resolvers which you can see here in the

601
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:38,799
table

602
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
on the right hand side

603
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,960
and on top of that we also issue the dns

604
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
requests to the

605
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,720
local resolvers of the write atlas probe

606
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,480
as you can also see in the table five of

607
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,080
the public

608
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,600
resolvers support dot already and

609
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,480
as for the local probes um this is not

610
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,039
really

611
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,120
or we weren't really sure if those uh

612
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,200
support dft or not so this ties back

613
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,720
into the

614
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,000
question of adoption of duty and for

615
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,400
those

616
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,360
we found that only 13 probes of the more

617
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,000
than 3 000 probes that we initially used

618
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
um had a point or received

619
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,320
the dot response successfully from their

620
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,280
local resolvers

621
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,360
which is roughly 0.4 only

622
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,440
nevertheless overall we collected around

623
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,320
90 million um dns measurements in total

624
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,240
which we will have a look at in the

625
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,960
upcoming slides

626
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,400
so okay first of all for reliability

627
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
we look at the reliability of dns over

628
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
tls based on failure rates

629
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,400
which you can see in this table which is

630
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,360
also

631
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,640
taken from the paper the failure rate in

632
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,320
this case is simply the

633
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,640
column of number of failures divided by

634
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,000
the

635
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,520
total number of measurement column in

636
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,120
this case

637
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,360
and obviously then the question would

638
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,000
occur what is a failure exactly

639
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
failure in this case is when a probe is

640
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
not able to send the

641
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,559
dns request to the resolver or on the

642
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,760
other hand

643
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,919
when the response was not received by

644
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,320
the probe so

645
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
in both cases the write atlas api

646
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,559
returns an error along with an error

647
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,360
message

648
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,440
which we had a look at and saw that the

649
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
most common errors in this case

650
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,159
for both traditional dns and dns over

651
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:30,960
tls

652
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,679
were timeouts errors related to sockets

653
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,880
to connect and tcp and tls related

654
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
errors

655
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
which is obviously dot exclusive since

656
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,400
dns over udp

657
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,559
doesn't use tcp or tls either

658
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,880
so when comparing the failure rates for

659
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,159
both protocols

660
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,400
in this case especially for the

661
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,520
resolvers that

662
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,840
use both or that offer and support both

663
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,000
protocols

664
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,880
you can see that dlt has higher failure

665
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,240
rates so

666
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,919
some inflation regarding the failure

667
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,679
rates which range

668
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,240
from just about half a percentage point

669
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
for google and cloudflare

670
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
over to a few percentage points with

671
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,480
what nine and clean browsing

672
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,120
and then lastly with more than 30

673
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,320
percentage points for the local

674
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,159
resolvers

675
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,159
um here you can also see that um

676
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:26,559
uncensoredness

677
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,000
has an inflation of more than 95

678
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,559
um percentage points which indicates

679
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,400
that there have been

680
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,520
issues closer on the server side um

681
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,480
for dot whereas for the other um dot

682
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
measurements we see that the issues are

683
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,000
closer to the probes

684
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,880
and along the paths um indicating that

685
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,400
the dot traffic is simply

686
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,720
dropped by some metal boxes which also

687
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
explains the high number of timeouts

688
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,159
that we see for our measurements

689
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,520
okay moving on we also take the previous

690
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,559
table that we've seen

691
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,080
and split this by region by the location

692
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,880
of the probe

693
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,720
to be more specific and this is

694
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,360
what it looks like so this matrix um

695
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,279
shows the median failure rate

696
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,880
for all the probes on a continent for a

697
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,720
specific resolver in this case

698
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,360
with traditional dns on top in the top

699
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
matrix and

700
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
dns over tls on the bottom one

701
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,400
so for dot in particular so the bottom

702
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,600
part of the figure

703
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
we see that the failure rates are

704
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,440
somewhat varying

705
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,039
regarding the different continents and

706
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,520
resolvers so some cells have

707
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,240
lower than one percent of a failure rate

708
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,159
whereas some other cells have close to

709
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,360
or even more than

710
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,279
10 and we also see that the majority of

711
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,080
the

712
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,360
cells which have higher failure rates um

713
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,480
are probes or belong to probes located

714
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,559
in africa and south america so

715
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,360
it seems like um there are more issues

716
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,919
um

717
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,840
with these on these

718
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
as for the local resolvers um on the

719
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,360
bottom figure you can see that we only

720
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,840
have

721
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,880
results for probes in europe and north

722
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,840
america

723
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,919
as i mentioned before we only saw um

724
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,039
local resolvers for

725
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,640
of 13 probes to return responses

726
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,880
at all and um these kind of were both

727
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,760
uh all of these 13 probes were located

728
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,960
in europe and north america respectively

729
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,600
um with both of the failure rates being

730
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,159
higher

731
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,279
by quite a bit so we have here failure

732
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:37,919
rates of

733
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,480
more than 30 to 40 percent compared to

734
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,840
most of the other

735
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,640
cells which are mostly single digit

736
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,679
percentages

737
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,960
for dot all right

738
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
moving on to the response times so with

739
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,840
rapidless this is a bit more tricky so

740
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,720
some background explanation of that for

741
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,240
traditional dns obviously you

742
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,640
simply send out the request over udp and

743
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,080
then the resolver will look up the

744
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,039
requested domain

745
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,600
either in its cache or recursively and

746
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,159
then send you back the response

747
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,039
now for dot you obviously have the pcp

748
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,840
and tls

749
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,039
handshakes before to establish the

750
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,679
connection session to secure the traffic

751
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,000
and typically a client would be reusing

752
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,039
this session

753
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,080
in order to get or minimize the overhead

754
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,399
of these handshakes

755
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,640
now for ripe atlas um this is a bit

756
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,080
difficult and different

757
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,919
since the measurements are designed to

758
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,760
be independent from each other

759
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,520
which means that these connections and

760
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,279
sessions are not kept alive in between

761
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,480
the measurements

762
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,360
meaning that the response times that we

763
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,039
measure here and present here

764
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,399
always include the full handshake of the

765
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,760
tcp and tila sanchex as a result this

766
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,320
will

767
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,640
roughly resemble upper bounds for the

768
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,080
dot lookups as

769
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,039
subsequent domain lookups would not have

770
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,080
to do the handshakes and

771
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,158
be or have a low response stamps

772
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,360
all right um so now also the part of the

773
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,919
remain

774
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,039
lookup may vary a bit so in order to

775
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,960
partially avoid this we focus on the

776
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,320
fifth percentiles

777
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,200
of each probe and resolver tuple and

778
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,640
given that we repeat the measurements

779
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,000
over a period of a week

780
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,679
and take the response times towards the

781
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,200
lower end of the distribution with the

782
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,399
fifth percentiles

783
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,880
this will therefore approximate the

784
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,600
cases of cached records

785
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,919
on this figure on the right hand side

786
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,679
you can see the cdf for these fifth

787
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,880
percentiles

788
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,760
and for dot we can see that the medians

789
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,600
are around 10 to 30 milliseconds for

790
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
most of the resolvers

791
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,000
whereas for dot um medians are roughly

792
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,399
130 250 milliseconds for the faster

793
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,360
resolvers

794
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
going up to more than 200 milliseconds

795
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,640
for some of the

796
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,559
slower resolvers and in this case

797
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,120
unsensitiveness is an outlier again at

798
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,480
one second for median

799
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
so when comparing both of these um we

800
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,679
can see that

801
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,480
the response times for dot are higher by

802
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,080
more than 100 milliseconds when compared

803
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,640
to the

804
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,840
traditional dns mostly due to the

805
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,919
connection and session establishment

806
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,720
and um before we saw that local

807
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,640
resolvers have more failures than public

808
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,039
ones

809
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,440
for dot but in this case the response

810
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,559
times are actually

811
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,480
somewhat comparable for these two types

812
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,799
of resolvers

813
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,200
now lastly again we split this by

814
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,840
original

815
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,559
um aspects i don't want to go into too

816
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,760
much detail here

817
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,679
so just briefly going over it this is

818
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,799
how it looks

819
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
and we see that before

820
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,320
the failure rates were somewhat varying

821
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,159
but also the response times

822
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,000
for dot dot is highly varying

823
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,080
regarding the cells on the bottom which

824
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,080
you can see

825
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,399
although again we see higher values

826
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
primarily for probes in africa and south

827
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,320
america

828
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,039
and also as mentioned for d.o.t the

829
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,399
failure rates were

830
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,480
higher but now for the local resolvers

831
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,880
we see somewhat comparable response

832
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,760
times between

833
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,200
local resolvers and public solvers

834
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,760
so just to sum it up um in conclusion we

835
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,880
saw that

836
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,519
the t adoption is still somewhat low

837
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,279
with less than half of a percent for

838
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,960
both the ipv4 address space

839
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,039
and local resolvers of the ripe atlas

840
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,120
probes although there has been some

841
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
decent progress regarding

842
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,279
the increasing support of dlt and newer

843
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,360
tls versions

844
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,799
for the reliability we saw that for the

845
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,559
failure rates are in some cases

846
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,200
comparable which was mostly the case for

847
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,080
public reserves when comparing to

848
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
traditional dns

849
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,159
and some cases much higher which was the

850
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,240
case for the public resolvers

851
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,159
and we've also seen some indications

852
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,080
that this is mostly due to

853
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,000
issues along the path with middle boxes

854
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,640
and lastly regarding the response times

855
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,360
we saw that

856
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
the unt is slower by more than 100

857
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,559
milliseconds

858
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,000
largely due to the connection and

859
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
session overhead as i just mentioned

860
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,919
although the response times for public

861
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,440
and local resolvers are

862
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,960
somewhat comparable and yeah finally

863
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,279
as mentioned all the measurement related

864
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,720
material is online

865
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,840
on our github repository um

866
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,880
and also the paper with more details and

867
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,559
if you have any questions you can

868
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,399
feel free to send us an email and i'm

869
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,320
also happy to take questions right now

870
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,559
if there are any

871
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,840
thanks fiat yeah we have a couple

872
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,360
minutes for questions so put yourself in

873
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,559
the queue if you'd like to speak

874
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,760
yes there was one comment about um do

875
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,200
compared to dot

876
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,720
in the chat are you planning to look at

877
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,799
this as well

878
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,919
um okay so with the wipe at list um you

879
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,120
cannot

880
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,279
run dns of https measurements

881
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,440
however there are some papers that have

882
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,960
um already looked at that

883
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,360
so this is probably not something that

884
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,880
we would be looking into

885
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,039
although there have been as i said some

886
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,840
studies that already did that

887
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,679
all right thanks fiat in the interest of

888
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,039
time we're going to switch on thanks for

889
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,000
bringing work

890
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,480
that we scooped pam on you saw the

891
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,159
results here before they're in pam

892
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,440
which is one of the things that mary and

893
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,720
i try to do in this group is bring you

894
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,919
the measurement result before it's

895
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:26,399
published

896
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,559
so uh thanks a lot okay thanks so much

897
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,399
so we have phone up next and

898
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,840
just to prove that his share should work

899
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,200
there we go

900
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,480
okay so can you see my screen now okay

901
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,000
thank you and i'll start a timer and

902
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,679
i'll let you know if it's looking like

903
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,480
you're having trouble

904
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,600
uh without two minutes in okay

905
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,840
so hello everyone my name is fong i'm a

906
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,399
phd candidate at stony brook university

907
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,040
and today i will be presenting our paper

908
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,800
with the title assessing the privacy

909
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,760
benefits of

910
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
domain name encryptions and this is a

911
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,918
joint word with a researcher at stony

912
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,480
brook university umass amherst and

913
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,239
uiuc and the word were actually

914
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,079
presented last year in

915
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,960
asia ccs

916
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,839
um so we all know that like the

917
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,280
adoptions of 2s is

918
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,679
increasing in recent years and more and

919
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,520
more network traffic get encrypted on

920
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,079
the internet

921
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,079
and just to give you a send of uh how

922
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,440
much this has been increasing

923
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,960
this is the screenshot i just got

924
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,280
yesterday from less encrypt

925
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,000
and they showed us almost 250 million

926
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,079
fully qualified domain has supported 2x

927
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,839
connections

928
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,239
and regardless of the use of tos and

929
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,639
https domain name is the last piece of

930
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,280
information

931
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,918
that you know has not been encrypted yet

932
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,719
and the

933
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,480
domain name actually can be considered

934
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,800
as important as and sensitive as the

935
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
content is hosted

936
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,839
so for example this domain name

937
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,440
just based on the domain name you can

938
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,359
actually tell a user say

939
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,680
online shopping activities health

940
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
conditions

941
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,440
religions gender identities or even

942
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,760
sexual habits

943
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,480
so where is domain name actually exposed

944
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,680
on the why

945
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,000
so this slide shows you like two common

946
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,119
places where domain

947
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,440
information can be monitored by an on

948
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,119
pad attacker

949
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,119
and these are packets captured when

950
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,960
visiting example.com

951
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,200
so the first place where domain

952
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,599
example.com exposed is through dns

953
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,680
queries and responses

954
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,079
and after getting back the ip address of

955
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,200
example.com

956
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,800
the client initiates connection to

957
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,520
portfolio 3 starter 2s handshake

958
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,079
and this is the second place where

959
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,000
domain name information is exposed

960
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,359
and this is because in previous 2s

961
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,400
version until 1.2 the 2s handset take

962
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,000
place before the actual encryption

963
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,800
happens

964
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,520
so it exposed the domain name

965
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,240
information

966
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,359
um on an extension called server name

967
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,720
indication

968
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
so the exposure of domain name

969
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,119
information in these two places

970
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,400
allow any on bad attacker

971
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,720
to tamper with user connections a

972
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,400
malicious attacker can

973
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,040
redirect a user to a destination where

974
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
malware is hosted or

975
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,960
state sponsor sensor can interfere with

976
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,079
user connections

977
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,040
based on the domain information seeing

978
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,480
on the dns or

979
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,160
sni field and so for the rest of this

980
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,119
presentation

981
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,280
i will first introduce the basic concept

982
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,320
of domain name

983
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,160
encryptions protocols and the

984
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,720
motivations behind austerity

985
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,800
the methodologies that we use to conduct

986
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,560
our measurement and then i will show the

987
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
analysis on the privacy benefit

988
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,119
provided by domain name encryptions due

989
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,560
to domain co-hosting

990
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,119
and the dynamics of domain-to-ib mapping

991
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,960
and finally i will discuss the potential

992
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,200
approaches for domain owners and hosting

993
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,560
providers

994
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
to help with increasing the privacy

995
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,599
benefit of

996
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,800
domain name encryptions so to address

997
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,560
the previous security and privacy

998
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,200
problems

999
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,240
of plaintext domain being exposed on the

1000
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,800
y

1001
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
domain encryption has been suggested in

1002
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,400
several proposals

1003
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,760
with dot com first and

1004
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,480
here dns queries and responses will be

1005
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,680
transmitted over

1006
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,760
a 2s channel and with doh dns

1007
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,800
resolutions you perform over uh https

1008
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,839
and of course they're going to be

1009
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,880
through port

1010
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,160
443 instead of 853

1011
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,320
and therefore inheriting all of the

1012
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,160
security and benefits of

1013
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,599
https protocol and finally starting with

1014
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,599
2s version 1.3 the server name

1015
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,839
indications extensions in the client

1016
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,040
hello message

1017
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,680
during the 2s handshake can be encrypted

1018
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
and with this proposal the domain name

1019
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,320
information

1020
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,599
on both dns and ts handshake traffic

1021
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,200
can can be secured so in this new

1022
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,000
setting

1023
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,400
a user and the dns resolver first

1024
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,920
established a channel

1025
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,560
um and this is an encrypted channel it

1026
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,400
can be over https or

1027
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,960
over 2s and after that all of dns

1028
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
queries and respond as sent over this

1029
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,960
channel

1030
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,640
and similarly during the 2s handshake

1031
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,599
process unlike in previous cos version

1032
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,760
sim version 1.3 their server name

1033
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,400
indication

1034
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,599
will be encrypted too i mean this is an

1035
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,400
optional option it's not compensate

1036
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,200
so in the rfc say that it's it's

1037
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,640
optional so

1038
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,800
this news protocol will prevent any

1039
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,119
unpat observer from seeing

1040
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,960
plain tech domain name on the wire

1041
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,119
so however in this new setting the

1042
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,599
attacker can still see the ip address

1043
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,000
of the destination server so actually on

1044
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
this slide that ip address is the actual

1045
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
ip address of example.com

1046
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,720
so now the attacker will try to guess

1047
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,520
okay if this

1048
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,640
ip hosts only example.com or any other

1049
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,160
website

1050
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,920
so here come the motivations of our

1051
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,720
study um given that the destination ip

1052
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,040
addresses are still visible on path

1053
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,079
to unpack observer we are interested in

1054
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,560
uh quantifying the potential improvement

1055
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
to user privacy

1056
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,800
um that a full deployment of domain name

1057
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,079
and christian could achieve

1058
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,680
in in practice and the extent to which

1059
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
the insurance can be easily met depend

1060
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,839
on two factors

1061
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,960
first whether all the domains are hosted

1062
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,119
on the same ip address or not

1063
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,400
and second the statability of mapping

1064
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,119
between a given domain and it's hosting

1065
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,440
ip address over time

1066
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,760
so here's the experiment setup so we

1067
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,040
first

1068
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,440
create a set of test domain by

1069
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,280
aggregating domains from alexis and

1070
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,880
majestic top list

1071
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,000
from the last 30 days that

1072
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,560
give us a set of around 7.5 million

1073
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,720
domains per day

1074
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,280
and next we perform an active dns

1075
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,440
measurements to resolve these domains

1076
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,319
into ip addresses and finally we

1077
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,280
analyzed

1078
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,839
all of the domain to ib mappings and

1079
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,760
study their co-hosting degree and the

1080
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,040
dynamics of

1081
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,640
domain to ibm mappings over a period of

1082
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,599
two months

1083
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,720
and since many domains and are hosted on

1084
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,839
cdns uh

1085
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,960
which is you know they map the domain to

1086
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,760
ip

1087
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
uh to different ip at different location

1088
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,240
so we conduct our experiment across

1089
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,880
nine different vantage points as shows

1090
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,760
on the map

1091
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,599
so we try to distribute our vantage

1092
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,160
point in the way that their geographical

1093
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,520
distance and maximize

1094
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,560
from each order now to capture the cdn

1095
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,680
behavior

1096
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,640
if there's any and so we conduct our

1097
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,400
measurement for periods of two months to

1098
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,440
examine

1099
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,000
the dynamics of domain to ib mappings

1100
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,680
over time

1101
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,319
so let's go back to the attack scenario

1102
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,280
in which

1103
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,160
the attacker can only see the ip address

1104
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,560
of

1105
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,839
the destination uh server so given an ip

1106
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:08,560
address

1107
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,119
there are two hosting possibilities the

1108
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,000
first one we prefer to as single hosted

1109
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,119
in which a domain is exclusively hosted

1110
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,440
on

1111
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,720
one or more ip addresses that

1112
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,280
do not host any other server on the

1113
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,720
order domain

1114
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,000
so in this case let's call k is the

1115
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,680
co-hosting degree

1116
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,119
then the co-hosting degree of

1117
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,280
example.com and all of this

1118
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,319
associated ip address is one

1119
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,440
and we refer to this hosting scenario

1120
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,400
as privacy detrimental this is because

1121
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,040
uh from

1122
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,240
an adversary point of view only

1123
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,000
you know seeing connections to this ip

1124
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,720
address alone is enough to infer which

1125
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,960
domain is being visited

1126
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,839
and for the second possibility we prefer

1127
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,200
to as mundi hosted

1128
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,599
in which an ip address holds more than

1129
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,560
one domain

1130
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,920
and in this case example.com say

1131
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,680
is hosted on one or more ip address

1132
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,240
ip addresses that also host many other

1133
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,520
domains

1134
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,079
so the co-hosting degree for an ip

1135
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,280
address in this case

1136
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,400
is the number of domain hosted on it

1137
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,960
and for the co-hosting degree of

1138
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,920
example.com

1139
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,960
we compute by taking the median of the

1140
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,400
co-hosting degree across

1141
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
all the ip addresses example.com is

1142
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,640
hosted on

1143
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,480
and for this case we refer to a privacy

1144
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,599
beneficial case because from the

1145
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,119
adversary point of view

1146
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,400
they cannot easily say okay just by

1147
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,079
seeing the ip address they cannot say

1148
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,119
which domain is actually being visited

1149
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,480
because everything else were encrypted

1150
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,760
so analyzing our data we found

1151
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,040
2.2 million unit ip addresses

1152
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,680
of which 70 percent holds only one

1153
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,800
domain names

1154
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,200
so this mean visitor of domain hosted on

1155
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,079
this addresses

1156
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,240
will not gain any privacy benefit by

1157
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,599
domain name encryption

1158
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,520
because of the one-to-one mapping

1159
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,760
between the domains and ip address

1160
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,560
and the rest 30 of ip addresses holds

1161
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,119
more than

1162
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,480
one domains however when considering the

1163
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,200
number of

1164
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,040
unit domains so this plot is showing

1165
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,520
the number of unit ip address but when

1166
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,000
we look at the number of unit domains

1167
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,040
this seventy percent uh of ib

1168
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,480
addresses correspond to only 1.4 million

1169
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,160
domain which is like 90

1170
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,280
of our test data and the rest thirty

1171
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,960
percent of ib address

1172
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,920
hosts six point one million domains um

1173
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,079
with its more than eighty percent of uh

1174
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,640
domains of uh in our study which which

1175
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,359
shows some

1176
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,160
co-hosting degree uh among uh this group

1177
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,079
of six point one 6.1

1178
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,440
millions domains so next we analyze the

1179
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,240
hosting degree

1180
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,160
as the percentage of all domains so 90

1181
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,359
of domains are single hosted which means

1182
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,040
this domain will will not get any

1183
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,560
privacy benefit uh

1184
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,200
from domain encryption and the rest uh

1185
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,160
eighty percent

1186
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,800
uh sorry the rest eighty percent um

1187
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,240
eighty percent of

1188
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,240
domains uh are co-hosted with more than

1189
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,599
one domain

1190
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,400
and however you know like they're around

1191
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,520
40 percent

1192
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,640
here of co-hosted domain

1193
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,680
host with less than 10 domains as we

1194
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,079
we move um toward the right-hand side

1195
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,280
the hosting degree

1196
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,200
increase and so there's the privacy

1197
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,920
benefit so we assume that

1198
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,880
the co-hosting degree k need to be

1199
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,839
greater than

1200
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,640
a hundred to provide some meaningful

1201
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,560
privacy because an adversary in this

1202
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,400
case can only correctly guess

1203
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,160
a domain being visited with a

1204
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,440
probability less than

1205
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,800
one percent so according to this plot

1206
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,160
only about thirty percent

1207
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,000
of domain will gain some meaningful

1208
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,599
privacy benefit from domain name

1209
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,119
encryption because they go hosted with

1210
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,160
more than 100

1211
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,160
domains so we investigate the top 10

1212
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,480
hosting providers that offer the highest

1213
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,760
score hosting degree

1214
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,640
per ip address as shows in the third

1215
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,920
column right here

1216
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,480
the average number of unit ip addresses

1217
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,440
observed for each

1218
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,040
provider is very low um with half

1219
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,839
of the hosting uh would have i'm hosting

1220
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:26,640
all domains

1221
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,280
on a single ip address and we use the

1222
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,079
heuriken

1223
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,599
electrics bgb toolkit to

1224
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,560
confirm that this provider is actually

1225
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,480
very small providers with many of them

1226
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,200
managing

1227
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,000
less than 10 000 ip address allocated by

1228
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,800
their

1229
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,960
regional internet authorities and when

1230
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,119
looking at the popularities of domain

1231
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,040
hosted on this provider

1232
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,839
as shows in the last column the highest

1233
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:52,800
rank one is

1234
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,319
at 386 positions hosted on squarespace

1235
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,359
why more than half of these providers

1236
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,680
host domain at well below

1237
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,240
top ten thousands so the takeaway here

1238
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,720
is that

1239
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,000
small providers um tend to host a large

1240
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,400
number of less popular domains on a

1241
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,359
small number

1242
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,359
of ip and then we investigate the top

1243
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,880
co-hosting degree

1244
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,359
the co-hosting degree by major providers

1245
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,920
that dominate the largest number of unit

1246
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,280
ip addresses

1247
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,839
so this two table lists the top 20 major

1248
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,800
hosting cdn providers

1249
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,359
with more than 5 000 unit ib address

1250
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,040
that we observe

1251
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,359
so unlike small hosting provider the

1252
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,720
majority

1253
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,760
provider the major provider hosts more

1254
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,520
popular domain

1255
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,720
and as you can see in the last column

1256
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,520
most in popular domain hosted by this

1257
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,319
provider are

1258
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,040
well within the top ten thousands uh

1259
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,319
rank

1260
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,160
however in contracts to the small

1261
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,480
providers the co-hosting degree per ip

1262
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,040
address

1263
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,920
offered by this provider is is quite low

1264
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,800
except for

1265
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,400
cloudflare in this case with the

1266
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,040
co-hosting degree of 16

1267
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,920
domains per ip address that we see from

1268
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,079
our experiment

1269
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,599
the rest of the providers host

1270
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,359
let's say less than 10 domain per ip

1271
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:18,160
address

1272
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,720
so this observation show that major

1273
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,520
providers

1274
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,880
host more popular domain but having a

1275
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,359
much

1276
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,800
lower co-hosting degree so

1277
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,920
the previous two plot you got sorry i

1278
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,040
just want to let you know you've got two

1279
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,839
minutes

1280
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,319
two minutes okay so the previous uh two

1281
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,400
slides show the true end of a privacy

1282
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,200
spectrum that

1283
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,319
on the right hand side um there's

1284
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,400
there's domain that co-hosted less

1285
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,480
popular domain that co-hosted on

1286
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,040
uh together with you know benefit from

1287
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,400
the domain christians

1288
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,559
but on the right hand side there's more

1289
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,640
popular domain but they're not co-hosted

1290
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,440
with any

1291
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,720
other uh domains and thirst you know

1292
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,200
receive less privacy benefit from domain

1293
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,119
name encryption

1294
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,400
um so let me skip this line um okay

1295
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,359
so let's go to the dynamic of domain to

1296
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,440
ib mapping so we conduct our measurement

1297
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,079
over two-month period and we see that

1298
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,440
you know like

1299
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,280
there's 22.7 million domain to ip

1300
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,720
mappings and

1301
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,079
the dynamics uh 80 of them

1302
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,920
are very dynamic which means they

1303
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,520
survive for only four days

1304
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,359
and um only 13

1305
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,839
of them are stable however if we look at

1306
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,520
the number of unit domains

1307
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,319
there's only two 0.2 million domains

1308
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,200
that are

1309
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,079
dynamic and the rest 92 percent of the

1310
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:42,559
domain

1311
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,880
are very stable so the takeaway is most

1312
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,280
domain are hosted on static ip address

1313
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,640
doesn't change over time so in summary

1314
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,800
you know regardless of the trend of core

1315
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,480
locations on the web domain

1316
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
encryption cannot really provide

1317
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,920
meaningful privacy benefit with

1318
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,119
the current degree of domain um to

1319
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,440
uh domain co-hostings in the ip address

1320
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,119
information can still

1321
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,640
uh visible to any unpacked observer

1322
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,240
and um to that end we make these two uh

1323
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,119
recommendations uh sorry three first

1324
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,000
their full domain

1325
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,079
name confidentiality must be preserved

1326
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,319
on both dns and 2s channel

1327
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,200
otherwise neither technology can provide

1328
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,960
actual privacy benefit

1329
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,000
just like via says in the previous

1330
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,640
presentation that the adoption of dlt is

1331
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,680
very low

1332
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,920
and you we can see more more of that in

1333
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,880
duh but still like the es and i

1334
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,440
adoption out there is still really small

1335
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,000
only cloudflare right now supporting it

1336
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,400
and for the main owner they can seek

1337
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,359
providers

1338
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,520
that offer a high co-hosting degree per

1339
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,400
ip address

1340
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,559
or you know like high dynamic domain to

1341
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,680
ip mappings

1342
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,400
and finally hosting provider can help

1343
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,000
increase the co-hosting degree by

1344
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,280
grouping more websites

1345
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,599
under the same ip or frequently rotate

1346
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,520
domain to ip mappings

1347
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,440
to further improve privacy benefit

1348
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,079
offered by domain name encryption

1349
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:09,599
and thanks for your attentions and we

1350
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,800
we make our data set available in this

1351
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,359
url

1352
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,599
on the slide you can get it it's

1353
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,880
publicly available

1354
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,559
and if you have any questions feel free

1355
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:20,960
to um send it to my email

1356
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,079
thank you thanks thanks a lot phong okay

1357
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:24,640
so

1358
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,640
you can reach phong at that address uh

1359
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,839
we've got a couple people in the queue

1360
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:28,720
let's take them

1361
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,680
that'll be andrew and eric uh let's make

1362
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,040
it quick because we only have an hour

1363
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,079
meeting here

1364
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,480
um and uh and then we'll switch to robin

1365
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,079
so andrew go ahead

1366
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,400
yeah hi thanks brother i was very

1367
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,200
interesting uh

1368
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,599
presentation and and uh good good robust

1369
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,440
data i just wanted to highlight a couple

1370
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,040
of us made a point um

1371
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,800
in the uh chat uh that uh uh

1372
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,200
i think yeah you made a good case for

1373
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,079
for the privacy

1374
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,599
benefits of uh co-location and so on

1375
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,760
uh or using cdns um did you consider

1376
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,359
though the potential uh privacy risks

1377
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,880
um and also security risks uh of

1378
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,240
increased centralization

1379
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,160
uh because potentially europe if you're

1380
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,680
encouraging centralization to get

1381
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,640
privacy

1382
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,040
but you also sacrifice privacy with

1383
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,559
centralization so i don't know if you've

1384
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,599
given that any thought

1385
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,040
at all thank you yeah actually this is

1386
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:23,920
uh

1387
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,160
another another paper that actually we

1388
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,359
wrote last year submit to

1389
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,160
nds math web about centralizing all of

1390
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,559
the dns query just to a single resolver

1391
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,000
like a lot of privacy

1392
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,920
controversial happening especially with

1393
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,920
cloudflare and firefox uh

1394
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,720
to me that is terrible too like we don't

1395
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,559
want to give all of our you know

1396
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,160
browsing history just to one single

1397
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,200
resolver

1398
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,400
um say cloudflare so to me like this is

1399
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,000
orthogonal to what i just

1400
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,720
present here but uh in terms of dns

1401
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,920
queries um

1402
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,400
in in the paper in another paper we

1403
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
suggest that we should split them out

1404
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,040
distributed across number resolver so

1405
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,119
that you know your browsing history

1406
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,119
is not known by just a single actor

1407
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,760
so yes centralization is terrible

1408
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:15,680
thanks well that's my cue i think

1409
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,720
uh erica scorland there's a lot um

1410
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,559
so um we actually did look at what you

1411
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,079
suggest in terms of spamming the

1412
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,599
uh queries across multiple solvers the

1413
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,880
problem is then every resolver gets a

1414
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,400
copy of a partial copy of your browsing

1415
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,839
history and given how much redundancy

1416
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:28,720
the browsing this tradition makes the

1417
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,000
problem worse not better

1418
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,440
um so if you have a fix for that i'd be

1419
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,119
interested in hearing it um

1420
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,359
the um but the reason i got up actually

1421
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:36,480
was um

1422
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,200
uh to ask um um martin thompson and

1423
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,119
yaryarco how to document this actually

1424
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,920
um and ted hardy i believe um so uh the

1425
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,599
reason i got up actually was to is to

1426
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:46,000
ask

1427
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,800
um uh have you done any assessment on

1428
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,680
the uh

1429
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,960
sort of relative impact of of you know

1430
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,400
uh um the actual size of the

1431
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,760
anonymity set so i mean like in some

1432
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,520
cases 10 is quite good right if it's

1433
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,400
like facebook

1434
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,559
and you know telegram that actually

1435
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,839
conceal intelligence traffic and

1436
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,040
facebook is quite valuable

1437
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,319
um on the other hand um um and also um

1438
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,720
there's uh i think a question about how

1439
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,599
much does reducing

1440
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,280
an enemy set help with traffic analysis

1441
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,720
attacks um because i know there's been a

1442
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,920
lot of work on that and those typically

1443
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,040
don't work well if you have a very large

1444
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,839
number of days but

1445
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:18,880
quite well when you have a small number

1446
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
of domains

1447
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,800
cool yeah um so thank you for the

1448
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,079
questions so

1449
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,400
in terms of sensitivity of a website

1450
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,079
it's really

1451
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,520
debatable here like what should we

1452
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,359
consider sensitive what is not

1453
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,920
and you know like if you go to just an

1454
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,599
ip within the range of say

1455
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,400
the as google you would whatever you use

1456
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,119
youtube google map or whatever gmail

1457
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:43,920
people don't really care but uh for in

1458
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,359
term of sensitives um

1459
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,400
the anonymity set here sometimes a set

1460
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,599
can be a hundred and

1461
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,920
if just one of them in their sensitive

1462
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,520
then that whole set can be really

1463
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,400
sensitive

1464
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,559
um actually we have a follow-up work on

1465
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,000
this and we actually

1466
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,559
do traffic analysts on a single website

1467
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:01,680
per website

1468
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,960
um and for 200 we analyze 200 000

1469
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,200
uh website include half of them are

1470
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,960
popular and half of them are sensitive

1471
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,680
websites

1472
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,920
and just based on the ip address you can

1473
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,280
pinpoint

1474
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,319
more than 90 90 percent precisely

1475
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,960
what even like the sensitive website in

1476
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,160
the long tail

1477
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,960
with the k anonymity really high but you

1478
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,480
can still pinpoint

1479
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,280
um with really high precisions based

1480
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,920
just on the ip address

1481
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,760
okay thanks guys um i'm sorry i have to

1482
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,040
cut you off um we're doing this

1483
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,480
experiment with these hour-long meetings

1484
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,280
if you

1485
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,119
write the chairs between the meetings if

1486
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,079
you think we should do something

1487
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,960
different

1488
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,640
uh and i'm sorry i dropped eric from the

1489
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,559
queue just because we're gonna be

1490
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,799
we're gonna run a couple minutes over um

1491
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,319
so that we can keep the

1492
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:47,839
session links for the other two

1493
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,920
presenters thanks a lot fong

1494
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,760
um robin can you can you open your

1495
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,000
slides or do you need me to do it

1496
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,280
we're seeing your whole screen okay

1497
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,319
yep thanks looks good go ahead i'll

1498
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,599
start a timer and i'll let you know when

1499
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,400
you have a minute left

1500
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,839
all right so let's talk q log again um

1501
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:10,160
so q log stands for quick logging which

1502
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,079
is an effort started about two years ago

1503
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:12,799
to make

1504
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,720
the new quicken h3 protocols a bit

1505
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,319
easier to debug

1506
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,480
and analyze because typically what you

1507
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,000
would do is you would take a

1508
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,160
network packet capture at some point and

1509
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,559
then use something like wireshark to

1510
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:25,760
analyze that

1511
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,280
and that's of course still possible with

1512
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,319
quick but more difficult because

1513
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,640
quick encrypts almost its entire

1514
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,599
transport layer

1515
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,000
as well so to do this you would have to

1516
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,520
store the entire packet capture

1517
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,359
including the full payload

1518
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,440
leading to some scalability and privacy

1519
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,280
issues i'm sure some of you have

1520
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,559
experienced this with

1521
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,559
encrypted application layer protocols in

1522
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,000
the past as well

1523
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,839
there's a second long-standing problem

1524
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,920
with this and that is that not all

1525
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,559
aspects of the protocol are reflected on

1526
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,520
the wire

1527
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,359
for example for transport things like

1528
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,520
congestion control typically aren't seen

1529
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,000
and so difficult to analyze so the

1530
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,079
solution that we proposed for quick was

1531
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,240
to instead move to logging at the end

1532
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,400
points directly in the implementations

1533
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,079
themselves

1534
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,680
the core thing there is that we propose

1535
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,760
to do this in a standardized way so it

1536
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,400
is a single format a single schema

1537
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,119
that all of the implementations follow

1538
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,839
making it easier to create

1539
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,040
reusable tooling and also to share data

1540
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,200
in between and that's of course not

1541
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,400
rocket science it's

1542
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,559
relatively simple as you can see here

1543
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,480
for now we are using json as a

1544
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,240
serialization format

1545
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,839
and we just define you know if you want

1546
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:40,000
to log receive packets these are the

1547
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,599
fields that you should log

1548
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,720
if you want to do something with

1549
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,240
congestion control on the right side

1550
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,000
these are the fields that

1551
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,040
you should log in this is what they

1552
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,440
should look like and so on

1553
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,280
using this across implementations is

1554
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,960
powerful because then we can build some

1555
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,400
tools

1556
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,079
which we have done in what is called the

1557
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,520
qvis project

1558
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,599
giving us for example this kind of

1559
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,680
sequence diagram showing packets going

1560
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,720
back and forth

1561
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,160
and also the metadata on the

1562
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,319
implementations but also

1563
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,960
quite powerful congestion control

1564
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,720
debugging tools quite interesting

1565
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,000
because in quick it's it's

1566
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
much easier to experiment with different

1567
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,599
gesture controllers

1568
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,480
over time this approach of having a

1569
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,520
shared format

1570
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,240
and reusable tools has turned out quite

1571
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,240
interesting and powerful

1572
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,160
leading to the majority of the quick

1573
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,319
implementations actually outputting

1574
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,040
this format most notably facebook is

1575
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,200
using this in production

1576
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,520
to help analyze their deployment of

1577
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,720
quick and hp3 at scale

1578
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,680
because of this relative success um we

1579
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,599
now have plans to adopt

1580
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,559
qlog in the quick working group uh they

1581
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:47,280
have been uh

1582
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,440
separate drafts until now but so we're

1583
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,040
moving to adoption soon

1584
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,079
and our goal there is not just to flash

1585
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,760
this out for quick and h3

1586
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,920
but also to start looking at how we can

1587
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,119
bring this to

1588
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,880
different protocols and different use

1589
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,480
cases as well

1590
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,160
because as you can imagine this type of

1591
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,000
approach can be very useful not just for

1592
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,119
quicken h3

1593
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,480
but also for example the things that

1594
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,040
we've listed below here

1595
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,720
one particular one i wanted to highlight

1596
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,079
this is the bottom one

1597
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,599
where we have a project that we are

1598
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,680
trying to log both

1599
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,400
very high level adaptive bitrate video

1600
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,200
streaming

1601
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,520
algorithm metadata together with the

1602
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,200
relatively low level quick

1603
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,359
adjust control parameters to try and

1604
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:28,640
assess how we can better

1605
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,079
match them up against each other

1606
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,760
i think from a research perspective and

1607
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,040
that's why i want to bring this to the

1608
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,400
map rg

1609
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,640
i think this approach will make it much

1610
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,160
easier to compare different

1611
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,920
implementations of protocols

1612
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,000
which in my opinion is something that is

1613
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,240
often severely lacking in the

1614
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,119
academic research community to date i

1615
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,240
also think it would be

1616
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,839
much easier to make it much easier to

1617
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,599
share data sets and to

1618
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,640
reuse them or revalidate results and

1619
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,319
then my hope is also that we might

1620
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,240
in this way get a bit more access to

1621
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,559
actual production or deployment level

1622
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:03,599
data sets

1623
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,880
if they can be properly anonymized first

1624
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,520
of course

1625
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,520
for example facebook has concretely

1626
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,640
indicated interest

1627
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,319
in exposing a larger data set

1628
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,160
with of course all the salient data

1629
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,359
removed again

1630
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,760
to make it easier to do actual research

1631
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,400
on real life network

1632
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,720
data which i think is a bit lacking as

1633
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,599
well

1634
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,920
or at least difficult to get access to

1635
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,160
for the broader community

1636
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,920
one example of that is is christian

1637
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,240
ritama who has already done something

1638
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,680
similar using public

1639
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,160
q logs from the quick interoperability

1640
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,040
servers

1641
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,880
so they have their public servers they

1642
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,240
expose their key logs

1643
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,480
for for debugging purposes and he

1644
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,640
already tried to to measure for example

1645
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,599
what are realistic

1646
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,760
packet loss patterns and what are

1647
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,880
causing them

1648
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,040
using these public key logs um

1649
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,440
thanks robin can you wrap it up yeah

1650
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,559
this is the last slide

1651
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,480
um cool so i would say if you're in any

1652
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:01,760
way interested in this type of thing

1653
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,680
join us in the quick working group

1654
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,000
or let us know on github thank you

1655
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,920
okay a quick question or comment

1656
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,319
um thanks thanks robin for bringing that

1657
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:17,760
update and accommodating our tight

1658
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,640
schedule

1659
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,359
uh and and uh pointing people to that

1660
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,280
tool

1661
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,359
all right so let's get uh so we're gonna

1662
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:27,280
run about 10 minutes over here

1663
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,799
and oh we got uh let's pee

1664
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,480
yeah we got pete ready to go we're about

thank you all right welcome to the ecn

1675
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,480
deployment observations talk i'm pete

1676
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,920
heist and i'll try to move through these

1677
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,359
slides briskly in case there's a

1678
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,799
question or two at the end

1679
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,400
we've got jonathan morton here as well

1680
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,119
for that part if needed

1681
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:10,559
so why did we go to the trouble of

1682
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:12,960
gathering data on ecn at an isp's border

1683
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,440
router

1684
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,040
well there are a few questions we'd like

1685
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,200
to answer for ecn engineering

1686
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,640
for endpoints we'd like to know what

1687
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,640
proportion of flows are easy and capable

1688
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,680
and how many clients are initiating ecn

1689
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,200
for middle boxes we'd like to know what

1690
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,680
proportion of paths appear to have 3168

1691
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,000
marking aqms so we know to what extent

1692
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,440
future experiments need to take that

1693
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,880
into account

1694
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,079
we'd also like to know about any

1695
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,160
unexpected uses of the ecn field

1696
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,000
since the signaling methods and failure

1697
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,440
modes are crucial for effective

1698
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,280
congestion control

1699
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,079
my cautionary note here is we think of

1700
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,839
this study as informative rather than

1701
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,680
authoritative given its size and fixed

1702
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,119
location however

1703
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,400
some of the results should still be

1704
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,599
useful and suggestive

1705
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,440
so some basic facts about the isp where

1706
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,119
data was collected these numbers give

1707
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,799
some sense of scale

1708
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,640
in any case i'm grateful to freenet

1709
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,480
libidets for running my scripts and

1710
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,920
collecting the data for me on their

1711
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,839
production gateway

1712
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,839
so how do we actually collect this data

1713
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,880
we use linux iptables and ipsets

1714
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,799
ipsets are essentially in kernel hash

1715
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,200
tables using a specified key of interest

1716
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,559
like ip address or ipn port and mapping

1717
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,319
to a packet and byte count

1718
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:23,920
the nice thing about them is that the

1719
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,839
quantity of data produced is relatively

1720
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:26,319
small

1721
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,960
and easy to process and also you have

1722
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,720
fewer privacy concerns than with packet

1723
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,440
captures

1724
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,880
as we're just counting packets meeting

1725
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,640
certain criteria

1726
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,680
on the other hand we don't know the

1727
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,839
benefit of deeper packet inspection or

1728
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,760
flow level analysis so there are some

1729
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,119
questions we can't answer

1730
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,119
like exactly what applications are

1731
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,680
setting the bits

1732
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,280
for performance we avoided anything that

1733
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:48,880
could cause a hash table lookup per

1734
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,359
packet

1735
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,200
as some lab test caution does against

1736
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,200
doing that in production so

1737
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,960
that leaves us without much detail on

1738
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,280
not ect packets which we can mostly live

1739
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,680
without

1740
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,839
so here's what we observed from the

1741
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:03,359
endpoints there are two main things to

1742
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,480
take away from this

1743
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,720
one is that ecn initiation seemed

1744
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,559
relatively low but also fairly

1745
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,520
widespread

1746
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,440
and the second is that server acceptance

1747
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,039
appeared high

1748
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,319
starting with the servers that should be

1749
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,640
easy to explain as most server os's have

1750
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,720
supported ecm acceptance for some time

1751
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,839
now

1752
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:22,000
start as for the clients since we

1753
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,160
consider an ecn synag coming back to an

1754
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,920
ip as indication that the ip has

1755
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,440
initiated ecn

1756
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,000
that 44 number may be a bit too high as

1757
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,240
a proxy for the percentage of ips truly

1758
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,599
using ecn

1759
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,440
as port scanning or other unforeseen

1760
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,520
sources of vcn synapse drive that number

1761
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,440
up

1762
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,799
for a rough sense of the distribution

1763
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,359
though around 35 percent of ips received

1764
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,839
at least

1765
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,720
one thousand ecn synax which is still a

1766
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,160
pretty high percentage relative to the

1767
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,920
percentage of flows that are likely to

1768
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,039
be ecn capable

1769
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,720
now on to how we detect aqm activity at

1770
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,960
a gateway or middle box ece is sometimes

1771
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,720
a more reliable indicator of congestion

1772
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,520
than ce

1773
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,839
because if we have an aqm downstream

1774
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,920
from the gateway we won't see any ce

1775
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,599
marks since they happen after packets

1776
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,359
have already passed through the gateway

1777
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:11,359
but we'll see the reflected ece marks in

1778
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:13,359
any case providing the transport headers

1779
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:14,799
aren't encrypted

1780
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,440
so we mainly look for non-zero ect 0 in

1781
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,520
both directions and non-zero ec

1782
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,000
in either direction however we did see

1783
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,839
some anomalies in the signaling data

1784
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,280
that appear to come from the os

1785
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,760
fingerprinting routines of port scanners

1786
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,440
to help explain how we attempt to filter

1787
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,200
these out with the ip in the middle here

1788
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,440
ending at 140.73

1789
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,839
we have ce and ece marks with a ratio

1790
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,200
close to one to one which

1791
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,920
doesn't look like aqm activity what we

1792
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,400
do is

1793
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,640
if the ece the ce ratio is greater than

1794
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:44,880
two to one we consider it possible aqm

1795
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,680
activity

1796
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,920
if it's less than two to one we subtract

1797
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,280
the ec marks from the

1798
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,960
ones in the opposite direction and if

1799
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:52,799
there are any left over we consider it

1800
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:56,079
possible aqm activity otherwise we don't

1801
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,839
the detection isn't perfect there may be

1802
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,760
false positives and negatives but we can

1803
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:00,960
also say that

1804
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,400
we likely missed some make you amps

1805
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,640
because we need both ecn flows and

1806
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,160
congestion to find them

1807
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,599
and as we'll see on the next slide that

1808
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:11,119
doesn't appear to be that easy

1809
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,200
so now we want to take a look at given

1810
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,440
that ecn was negotiated how often was

1811
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,000
any aqm activity actually detected

1812
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,359
first i should point out we have some

1813
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,839
known aqms deployed namely fqcoddle is

1814
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,680
being used for two subnets

1815
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,039
since i helped break the scripts to

1816
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,880
deploy these aqms you might say

1817
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,960
pete you've affected the outcome of the

1818
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,720
results and that is true

1819
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:32,160
but it turns out that the knowledge of

1820
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:34,319
aqm deployment also gives a better look

1821
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,000
at what the stats look like when there

1822
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,359
is a known aqm

1823
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,799
and helps us pin down how well we're

1824
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:41,200
detecting aqms but we do not include

1825
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,280
these known aqm subnets along the

1826
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,839
so-called

1827
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:46,880
random paths since we influenced them

1828
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,799
so what we did here is split the ips

1829
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,559
into those that pass through a known aqm

1830
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,000
and those that do not

1831
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,559
in the table we see that 60 of ecn

1832
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,960
negotiating user ips with a node aqm

1833
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,760
saw possible aqm activity which roughly

1834
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,440
represents our detection rate

1835
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,839
well after observations for three weeks

1836
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,640
why isn't our detection rate 100 percent

1837
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:08,480
that's very likely because as noted

1838
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,319
before you need both an ac uncapable

1839
01:06:10,319 --> 01:06:12,079
flow and congestion to see it so we

1840
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,359
simply might miss it

1841
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:15,200
especially if there are aqms and devices

1842
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,680
that don't often see congestion

1843
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,640
next that 10.3 value in amber that's our

1844
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,480
rough proxy for the percentage of

1845
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,480
random paths that may have an aqm

1846
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,520
deployed

1847
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:26,799
assuming that we've missed them at the

1848
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:28,559
same rate as the known pass we could

1849
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,240
arguably scale that up from ten percent

1850
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,359
to about one and six

1851
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,520
but to be more conservative we haven't

1852
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,039
done that here

1853
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,400
finally given that we've probably not

1854
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,240
classified all the aqm activity

1855
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,599
correctly and that we've missed some

1856
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:40,319
aqms

1857
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:41,839
ten percent plus or minus an order of

1858
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,839
magnitude is about what we can reliably

1859
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:46,640
say

1860
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,359
as for ecn endpoints set for non-tcp

1861
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,720
protocols i'll go through this

1862
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,240
relatively quickly but

1863
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,119
unlike tcp the data for non-tcp is less

1864
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,119
clearly attributable to ecn because we

1865
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,039
apparently observed at least some misuse

1866
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,400
of the field

1867
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,319
for one the proportion of marks from the

1868
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,160
wan is higher than one would expect

1869
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,760
even taking into account the ten to one

1870
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,480
ratio of traffic between the wan and lan

1871
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,480
and also note that we saw one ip with

1872
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,760
clear misuse of the currently

1873
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,920
unallocated ect1 which accounted for

1874
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,640
some

1875
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,000
97 of the ect1 usage in total

1876
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,440
that could potentially have been a large

1877
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,359
peer-to-peer download download from this

1878
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,760
configured peer but in any case

1879
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,599
this confirms that at least occasional

1880
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,440
and sometimes spectacular misuse of the

1881
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,799
ecn field does happen

1882
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,240
so what are the possible reasons for ecn

1883
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,720
use on non-tcp protocols at all

1884
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,720
there could be tunnel dcn traffic but

1885
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,000
since there are different methods of

1886
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,160
encapsulation of the ecn field and since

1887
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,880
those can be asymmetric it's hard to say

1888
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,640
based on the ports we saw in use like

1889
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:49,039
ipsec net traversal and wireguard

1890
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,960
we almost certainly saw tunnel traffic

1891
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,119
but tunnel dc in traffic we can't say

1892
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,240
definitively

1893
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,240
and this study didn't look at protocols

1894
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,760
not supported by contract

1895
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,240
which for example includes ipsec esp

1896
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,359
packets using ip protocol number 50.

1897
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:04,799
there was some discussion on the list

1898
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:07,359
that we could be seeing quick ecn here

1899
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,880
that's also a possibility in at least

1900
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:11,280
one ip despot pair we saw but again we

1901
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,039
can't say for sure without deeper packet

1902
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,240
inspection

1903
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,599
we think there's very likely to be

1904
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:17,759
misuse of the ecn feel going on here and

1905
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:18,960
we speculate by

1906
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,759
bit torrent traffic the now obsolete rfc

1907
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:23,679
1349 defines a value for

1908
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,759
minimized monetary cost that conflicts

1909
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,279
with ect 0

1910
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,359
and if a developer also forgets to shift

1911
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,279
that absolute value to the left by one

1912
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,040
they might end up with an ect one as

1913
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,399
well

1914
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,080
we did we did not see extensive

1915
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,399
marketing on non-tcp traffic overall but

1916
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,640
what we did see is that misuse of the

1917
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,479
ecn field can be expected

1918
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,278
from time to time

1919
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,920
so thanks for listening and if anyone

1920
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,120
wants to repeat this experiment

1921
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,640
somewhere else i'll try to help support

1922
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:50,960
that

1923
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,399
it should be possible to scale the

1924
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,238
collection script up to larger networks

1925
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:54,640
but

1926
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,319
it should first undergo another revision

1927
01:08:56,319 --> 01:08:58,080
to address some of the limitations

1928
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,000
mentioned in the draft

1929
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,600
so with that i i don't know if you have

1930
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,120
any time left for questions so i'll

1931
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,080
leave that up to the chairs

1932
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,238
uh thanks a lot pete uh we don't have

1933
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,000
anyone in queue i think i'd like to cut

1934
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,040
it just because we're running ten

1935
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,000
minutes over

1936
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,759
um i really appreciate you guys fitting

1937
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,600
into our just hour-long meeting

1938
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:20,319
uh and maria any closing thought no

1939
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:23,600
okay i think okay go ahead

1940
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,279
thanks for joining us thanks for joining

1941
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,279
everyone we had about 135 people

1942
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,359
uh really nice uh i would love to know

1943
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,399
if you if

1944
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,759
what you think about the meeting length

1945
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,040
we did these two one-hour meeting

1946
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,799
experiments

1947
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,560
to try to throw as much as quickly as

1948
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,719
can we can as possible to you

1949
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,719
but we can certainly do something else

1950
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,000
next time

1951
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,560
take care have a good week bye

1952
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,640
you
