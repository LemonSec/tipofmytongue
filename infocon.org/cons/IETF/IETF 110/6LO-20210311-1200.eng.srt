1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
um

2
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
this

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
i think it's one minute past the start

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,000
time so we should get started

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
we have about 23 people and

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,119
uh we have about 90 minutes of the

7
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,600
agenda

8
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
uh before we get started we need a mini

9
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,240
taker and

10
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,039
javascript the links for both are here

11
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
anyone

12
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,800
so perhaps um well

13
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,840
hurry to ask basically that perhaps anna

14
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,280
i don't know if

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
we might be able to take a few minutes

16
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,440
perhaps if more people can join so this

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,280
should be actually some collaborative

18
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,480
process

19
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,800
and you can see actually there's the

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,239
code dmd link

21
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
on the slide you can also find it from

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,599
the agenda

23
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,000
page and yeah let's hope that

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,840
people can can contribute to me taking

25
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
thanks lauren i am guessing you are

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,159
going to take the

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,680
minutes in the kodi md i will also be

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
helping

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,159
anybody who's on jabber who can be the

30
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
javascript

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,320
all right uh should we get started

32
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,000
okay yeah i think so

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
so here's the note well

34
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
and this is our agenda for the day uh we

35
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
have about

36
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,199
90 minutes of agenda items anyone wants

37
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,759
to add

38
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,840
or modify this

39
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
so perhaps just one moment here that we

40
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,560
actually requested

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
our spot but we were given a two

42
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
two-hour slot

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
so i guess for avoiding conflicts with

44
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,000
other working groups

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,440
so yeah it turns out we have more

46
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,039
flexibility

47
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:11,840
so than in other times

48
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,280
all right

49
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,000
uh a quick update on all the active

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,400
graphs that we have

51
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,880
since the last time we met in november

52
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,080
2020 we

53
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,000
uh we have uh four uh rfcs published for

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,039
the work

55
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,080
we did in the last few years

56
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
um congratulations to the work group

57
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,400
and for the rest of the the drafts that

58
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,720
are in various stages of ist processing

59
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
we will

60
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,080
have a quick update uh in the in the

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,199
discussion today

62
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,520
uh for the packet delivery deadline

63
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,560
that's in the rfc editor queue uh

64
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,440
eric do you want to give a quick update

65
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,759
on it

66
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,479
i can report that

67
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,680
it's in cluster 310

68
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
many many many things were blocking on

69
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,840
cluster 238 being published which

70
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,199
finally happened

71
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
um and uh

72
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,639
the rfc editor seems to think there are

73
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,720
still three uh references that need to

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,960
be published first i think

75
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
six dish architecture detonate

76
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
architecture

77
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,560
and roll routing dispatch and uh

78
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,000
i wonder if that's actually true

79
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,440
uh because

80
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,080
uh there was another case uh in a quick

81
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,359
document where there was uh

82
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,680
yeah so dead knit architecture is a

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
normative reference

84
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,440
as is uh roll rounding ditch batch

85
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,680
so uh if you want i can email the rfc

86
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,240
editor

87
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
but it's uh it's part of this cluster

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
310 and i will paste

89
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,840
that link in the java

90
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
so it's it's uh you can see

91
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:17,840
there what its three dependencies are

92
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
but i i suspect that uh the answer will

93
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,960
be a

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
uh many things were blocked on 238 and b

95
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
uh the other defenses

96
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,440
are still in the process of being worked

97
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,199
okay cool uh thanks eric

98
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,160
so the next uh um

99
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
status update uh on on the draft that we

100
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,879
have will be on the

101
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,440
um ble mesh uh callus

102
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,160
so perhaps one point before starting

103
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,720
with

104
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,240
this presentation would be again eric if

105
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
you could provide us some feedback about

106
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
the nfc draft

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
because there was some message from

108
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,840
benjamin who had

109
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,000
discussed on the document in october i

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,879
think

111
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
so well would be good perhaps if you

112
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,560
have any updates on that

113
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
the nfc draft oh so not the bluetooth

114
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,680
mesh

115
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
uh yeah yeah

116
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,520
yeah if you showed that intro yeah

117
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:40,880
so it's yeah the nfc-17

118
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,279
yeah this is in my this is in my queue

119
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,560
um

120
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,640
there was an update and

121
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,000
[Music]

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,160
uh let's see

123
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,839
one of the

124
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,600
one of the blocking comments well from

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399
someone who is no longer on the isg

126
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,640
uh was centered around the fact that the

127
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,360
nfc spec is not public to read

128
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,880
uh i don't suppose that's changed at all

129
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,959
and i don't suppose it's going to change

130
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,599
please please speak up if it does change

131
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,800
so uh truth if there's any author from

132
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
the mfc draft

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,959
who could explain if for whatever reason

134
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,000
now the nfc

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,480
specification is available is open

136
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,399
and apart from that um i don't think

137
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,200
i've seen

138
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,399
well sorry i don't remember any

139
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,600
uh yeah i say i have to check

140
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
i don't i don't see that i've uh

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,320
i've seen any response uh that's closed

142
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,040
out all of ben's issues

143
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,640
but i have to admit i have also not uh

144
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,519
followed closely

145
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
let me check

146
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,640
okay thank you so should we then move to

147

yeah i'll uh i'll have to

150
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
catch up on what happened with this

151
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,760

then uh well this is carlos here

155
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
as a working group participant i'm going

156
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,160
to present

157
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,279
the status of and the proposed updates

158
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,040
for the document entitled ipv6 mesh over

159
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,399
bluetooth low energy

160
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,040
using ipsp next please

161
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,720
so first of all let's take a look at the

162
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,440
status

163
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,279
of the draft so since the last meeting

164
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,160
there were a number of pre-isg reviews

165
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,440
on the previous version of the

166
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,240
draft which was 08 those were the

167
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,800
reviews from the routing directorate iot

168
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,600
directorate

169
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,200
general area and security directorate

170
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,760
and well we would like to thank all the

171
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,480
reviewers

173
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,720
of the

174
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,839
comments were editorial perhaps except

175
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,880
for the review by dominique from the iot

176
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,600
directorate

177
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,640
which included also a few technical

178
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,160
points and questions so after that we

179
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,880
produced

180
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,200
dash zero nine with aim to address the

181
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,720
comments received

182
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
and also we hope that the answers

183
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
provided by email were

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
sufficient to address the different

185
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,760
questions

186
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,079
so once again thank you to all the

187
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:04,880
reviewers

188
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,839
for the feedback the next please

189
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,040
so then revision09 which is the current

190
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,240
one the last one

191
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
has recently been reviewed by the isg

192
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,959
this is a couple of weeks ago

193
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,000
so you can see on the slide some

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,920
figure showing the summary of the

195
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,440
ballots by the different isg members

196
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,240
so there are two discuss points one by

197
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,200
martin duke

198
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,680
another one by benjamin and then there

199
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,040
are a few comments

200
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,480
some of them also by benjamin and by

201
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,920
martin b and robert wilton

202
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,200
so next i will present the different

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,160
discuss and comments provided and which

204
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
is the approach from the authors

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,240
in order to update the draft to try to

206
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,279
address them

207
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,079
so next please

208
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,399
so the first discuss point is the one by

209
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,680
martin duke so it's about a paragraph

210
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
that we have in section 3.1 which

211
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
focuses on protocol stack

212
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
so we have a sentence that states

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,639
currently

214
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,639
that this specification allows using

215
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,959
different mtu's in different links

216
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,200
and in the same paragraph we explained

217
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,000
that

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
if there's some application or some use

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
case which requires

220
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
the same mtu to be used in all links

221
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
then if there's a new link which appears

222
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,000
with some smaller

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
mtu that might lead to some sort of

224
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,920
network white

225
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,480
mtu renegotiation cascade throughout all

226
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
the links

227
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,240
and martin explained well pointed out

228
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
that this could be about property

229
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,880
so the original idea here was that

230
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,760
since the ipsp which is the mechanism

231
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,839
used to establish ling layer connections

232
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,639
supports this flexibility of different

233
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,760
mtus

234
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,720
then perhaps we thought initially it

235
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
could be a good idea to keep this

236
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,519
flexibility

237
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,720
however yeah now after the feedback

238
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,800
and also there's another comment by

239
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
benjamin who also points out that this

240
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,600
same

241
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,839
issue could be considered a security

242
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,120
issue as well

243
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,079
then our approach our proposal for the

244
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,199
next update

245
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,000
would be to to fix this by stating that

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,880
the mtu size in ipv6 mesh over bluetooth

247
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,360
le

248
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,880
is 280 bytes so this would be

249
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,720
in the style of for example what is in

250
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,120
rc4944

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
which is in that case for the 15.4

252
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,920
network

253
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
so i don't know if there may be any

254
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,839
comment on this

255
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
okay so if there's no comments

256
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,440
let's move to the next slide please

257
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
thank you so the second discuss point

258
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,560
is by sorry by benjamin and that's

259
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
on the section which focuses on label

260
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,920
discovery

261
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,639
so currently we have a sentence which is

262
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,279
that as per out of c8505 the six line

263
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:15,839
must not

264
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,480
register its link local address however

265
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,240
well we need to apologize because we

266
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,279
missed adding

267
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,120
with the signal br at the end so here

268
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,480
the intention was

269
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,160
to explain that we use the uh simplified

270
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
uh procedures for duplicate address

271
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,600
detection

272
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,199
which are offered by 8505 and then

273
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,199
there's another point which is that

274
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,560
anyway

275
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,759
in this case in our mesh of a ble

276
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,279
scenario um registering the switzerlands

277
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,160
lla with the cxlr would be redundant

278
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,120
okay

279
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,800
because uh the 6lr would know the prefix

280
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,079
and also would know the id because it's

281
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,959
formed based

282
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
on the bluetooth device address which

283
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,279
would be known at the moment of linglia

284
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
connection establishment

285
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,320
so uh yeah this would be redundant so we

286
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,560
would like to keep this so

287
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,519
our proposal for the next revision of

288
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,079
the draft

289
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,720
would be on the first point to explain

290
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,160
that the messages

291
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
which are exchanged between the 6lr and

292
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,440
the 6lbr

293
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
for duplicate address detection are not

294
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,720
needed not

295
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,639
used this is uh according to 8505

296
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,360
and on the second point we would add

297
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,519
that by this specification sigzeln

298
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,040
must not register its link local address

299
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
because it would be redundant and also

300
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,279
as the cslr already ensures link local

301
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,040
address uniqueness as part of

302
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,880
bluetooth le connection establishment

303
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,399
procedures

304
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,279
so um yeah pascal you may have a comment

305
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,399
yeah yes uh can you hear me yes

306
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,959
the the problem with with this is um the

307
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,720
the registration of the link local

308
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,639
is used because after that you will use

309
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639
the link local as source

310
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
uh to to do do anything like register

311
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,959
the global address and so this step was

312
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,240
actually

313
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,559
making sure that there is neighbor cache

314
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,240
it's throughout the router

315
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
so if you omit completely this

316
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
registration

317
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,760
what do you save i mean the clean way is

318
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
to do it

319
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,918
yeah yeah

320
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,000
yes so so yeah the idea probably was

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,959
trying to save

322
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
like a couple of messages here but uh

323
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
yeah i agree that this is uh actually

324
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,600
the the clear

325
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,880
sorry the clean way to to proceed so

326
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,440
yeah that's that's no more i mean if if

327
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,160
you just

328
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
register to the 6lr that's you said

329
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
correctly the 6lr doesn't need to go to

330
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,120
the 6lbr

331
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,720
so it's just very local between those

332
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,120
two if you just do it it doesn't cost

333
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,080
much and then

334
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,000
you're cleanly inside the architecture

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,880
if you try to save that

336
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,720
you're putting yourself in a nightmare

337
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,039
of primes so why would you do that

338
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,240
okay yes so yeah i

339
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,480
understand this and yeah so we'll

340
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,919
discuss again with the authors and

341
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,039
probably

342
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,400
uh modify this proposal okay so yeah

343
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
we will show our proposal

344
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
in the next update so thank you pascal

345
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,919
for the feedback

346
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,840
then um any other comment

347
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,880
so then we may move to the next slide

348
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
please

349
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,799
okay then now about the comments

350
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,360
the first one by benjamin still about

351
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,120
label discovery

352
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,160
so we have a sentence here where we

353
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,280
state that the bluetooth led 601 should

354
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
register it's not only local addresses

355
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,640
so

356
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,480
here the point is it's a shoot not a

357
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,679
must

358
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,640
and we explain already in the text that

359
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,600
there may be

360
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,640
some uh motivation when we have

361
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,160
short-lived connections okay um

362
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,559
in some cases trying again to be a bit

363
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,919
more efficient

364
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,720
and we also include the consequences of

365
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
not doing so

366
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
basically we state in the document

367
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
currently that the 6lm would be

368
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,600
unreachable

369
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
there would be no duplicate address

370
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
detection and so on

371
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
so here benjamin made the question of

372
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
where could he find like the complete

373
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
list of consequences of

374
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,640
not registering the non-llas

375
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,679
um so well i think we are

376
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,320
the authors are perhaps not aware of

377
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,840
such a document compiling all these

378
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,240
consequences

379
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
so um pascal i don't know if you may

380
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,280
want to

381
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,880
make a comment here yes uh two comments

382
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,559
actually the first one is

383
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,880
if i think i'm pretty sure at five for

384
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,559
five so it's a must

385
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,200
and so you must if you make it a should

386
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
you need to indicate that you update

387
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,679
or whatever term uh 8545 the the the

388
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,559
reason why

389
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,880
it's a must is also because uh the

390
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,320
expectation is

391
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
that the cxlr might do

392
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,799
savvy operation whereby if a node

393
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,440
sources a packet with an address

394
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,240
which was not validated as being his

395
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
address

396
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,080
then it's valid for the cxlr to to drop

397
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,240
the packets

398
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,159
like you we don't shake hands you don't

399
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,000
tell me i'm careless and then you send a

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
mail saying i'm from carlos i might just

401
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,080
destroy this mail

402
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,280
right so

403
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,520
that's part of the thing if you don't

404
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,679
again if you don't play by the rules

405
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,720
then as benjamin correctly said there

406
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,000
are hidden consequences

407
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,919
that don't meet the eye one of them is

408
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,840
savvy

409
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,360
if somebody implements savvy you're

410
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,840
screwed

411
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
okay thank you thank you again for the

412
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,039
feedback yes so

413
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,400
i guess well this came from some comment

414
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,120
from the list

415
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,880
some time ago as some way to try to be a

416
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,840
bit more efficient

417
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,200
save a few messages here especially for

418
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,840
some devices which may be sending some

419
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,320
packet

420
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
quite infrequently perhaps not expanding

421
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,799
not expecting a response

422
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,440
but yeah again uh i understand the

423
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
reasons so perhaps it's

424
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,280
clearer or cleaner to to perhaps avoid

425
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,760
these

426
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,480
sort of issues

427
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,640
anyway yes you would have to to document

428
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,120
it

429
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,559
why infringing the architecture is a

430
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
good idea but i i can't see that it's

431
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
such a good idea it doesn't cost a match

432
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,559
and that was my point you can use a very

433
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,320
long lifetime

434
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
um so you do it and you can you can make

435
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,440
a lifetime for

436
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
i mean if your system accepts one year

437
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,799
why don't you i don't remember what the

438
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,520
maximum

439
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,600
in the signaling but make it very very

440
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
long and so

441
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,559
again it doesn't cost so much and and

442
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,400
join nightmare of hidden consequences

443
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,520
okay yeah so yeah i hear you that

444
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
definitely it's cleaner if we have a

445
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,360
must

446
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,000
also well we'll explain this to the

447
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,880
people who have the feedback trying to

448
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,880
you don't even make it the most careless

449
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,600
you you or or you put it lowercase

450
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,760
because the most is already elsewhere

451
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,039
right so you don't want to have

452
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,360
redundant uppercase

453
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,200
yeah okay thank you

454
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
thank you very much for the feedback

455
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,240
okay

456
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,720
so then we may move to the next slide

457
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,039
please

458
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,760
another comment was on the array of

459
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,720
header compression

460
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,840
by benjamin um so

461
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
we stayed currently in the draft that an

462
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,360
ra

463
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,679
router advertisement may include this

464
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,880
xco

465
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,280
here the point is that it used to be a

466
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
must in rfc 7668

467
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,960
by the way this rfc is the specification

468
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,280
for ipv6 over star topology

469
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,720
ble so in the text

470
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,960
we explained that well we use an a here

471
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
because it would not be needed when

472
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,640
context is

473
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
pre-provisioned or provided by some out

474
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,559
of band beams

475
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,640
and then benjamin makes the question of

476
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,080
whether then the

477
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,880
in-band 60o context indication would be

478
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
then superfluous

479
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,400
so well our approach would be to

480
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,280
answer that yes that's what happens and

481
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,200
to explicitly state so in the document

482
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,440
yes pascal so sorry but

483
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
there are other reasons why cco should

484
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,480
be there

485
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,120
and that's also how the 6lr signals that

486
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
you can do at 505.

487
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,200
so

488
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,000
yeah yeah i understand you're trying to

489
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,279
save something but if you have enough

490
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,760
bandwidth to put the c6co

491
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,880
then it really should be there otherwise

492
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,960
you don't know if your router does it

493
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,559
505 now you may say

494
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,240
it obviously does it because it always

495
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,960
does um then there must be another mess

496
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
somewhere which says

497
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,159
the any router that connects to those

498
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,600
things must

499
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,760
be 6lrs because otherwise you don't know

500
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,799
if it is or if it is not

501
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
okay yeah thank you thank you for the

502
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,039
point

503
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,080
yeah uh we will well

504
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
i guess we'll need to uh take into

505
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,159
account your your comment

506
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,080
and yes so yeah we will come up with

507
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
some

508
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
approach some some solution uh but yes

509
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:44,799
definitely

510
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,000
if we need to signal 8505

511
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,840
then probably this might need to be a

512
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,520
must so yeah

513
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,720
um okay then

514
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,080
thanks again pascal then

515
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,840
perhaps we can move to the next slide

516
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
okay so then there there are other

517
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,400
comments

518
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
so the first one by uh martin um

519
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
is about the requirements language so

520
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,679
basically here in the section

521
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
which is at the beginning of the

522
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
document the usual 2119

523
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,039
section uh was intended to actually be

524
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,720
the 8174 one

525
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,600
however we were missing one part which

526
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,240
is

527
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,200
the not recommended term in all capitals

528
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,679
so

529
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,480
yeah we are going to add that definitely

530
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,039
and

531
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,679
the other comment is by robert wilton

532
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
focusing on figure 2 which is the one

533
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,480
shown

534
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,679
on the screen here the first comment was

535
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,799
suggested to to remove the bubble which

536
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,760
is

537
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,840
surrounding the subnet part of the

538
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
figure because it seems

539
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,559
this confused him a little bit so yeah

540
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,760
there's no problem let's

541
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,000
do it for the next update and then there

542
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,919
was some question

543
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,640
about uh whether the top left note in

544
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,679
that figure

545
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,080
is that actually intended as a 6lr or

546
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,039
was that some

547
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,320
sort of typo so the answer is that yes

548
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,279
it was actually intended as a 6lr

549
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:17,760
because

550
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,520
it is to illustrate that perhaps

551
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
temporarily or perhaps more permanently

552
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,400
we could have something like this that's

553
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,159
a router perhaps

554
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,039
uh for a while or for a longer time at

555
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,159
the edge of a network

556
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,200
so uh pascal

557
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,440
yes i'm sorry uh just to express i was

558
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,320
confused uh

559
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
it was the previous comment was about

560
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,679
the six cio and and

561
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,760
you you were talking about the six co it

562
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,279
was my confusion

563
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,679
please don't worry the six cio is the

564
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,279
one that is that must be there not the

565
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,080
six ceo

566
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,240
sorry okay secure is the compression

567
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,400
option cio is the capability information

568
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,799
option

569
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,440
yes okay i i had the glitch in my brain

570
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,559
sorry for this

571
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,640
okay no worries thank you thank you very

572
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,840
much

573
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,039
um okay so then

574
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,720
i don't know if there may be any other

575
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,159
comment anything else

576
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,520
because i believe this is the last well

577
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,159
yeah the last slide with actual content

578
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:16,720
so

579
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,840
yeah our plan is to update the draft

580
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,720
take into

581
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,760
consideration all the feedback uh thanks

582
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,559
again

583
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,720
and we hope that soon we may have

584
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,000
version 10 which

585
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,720
hopefully well it's intended to address

586
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,360
the

587
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,919
different points by the isd members so

588
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,320
thank you

589
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,520

593
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,399
well um well

594
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,600
it could be valuable uh i think

595
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,320
perhaps pascal reviewed some earlier

596
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,520
version of the document

597
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,640
i don't know if well i read not long ago

598

but

599
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,000

helpful comments actually the

615
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,600
the comments are from the general area

616
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
the ops area and the

617
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,399
security area and transporter area and

618
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,080
we have replied to these

619
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,799
reviews in the meeting list and will

620
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,520
update

621
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,200
the draft very soon and the next

622
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,520
slide please

623
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,640
yeah thank you uh the review

624
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,600
of the security area is done by robert

625
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,080
and

626
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,279
his first comment is about the section 5

627
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,399
in the draft in this section we

628
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,720
mainly talk about the scenarios and

629
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,520
topologies

630
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,480
of the constrained plc networks and

631
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,279
roberts

632
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,600
considers that this section is

633
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,720
informational and

634
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,320
has no impact to the implementers of

635
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,760
construing the plc network and we think

636
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,120
it is true it is a firm con comment

637
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,279
so our question to the working group is

638
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,480
that if we can

639
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,919
remove this section or move it to the

640
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:54,960
appendix

641
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,799
so any ideas on this comment

642
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,080
should we remove it or just put it

643
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,840
into the app index which is the correct

644
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
way

645
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,360
hello so uh speaking here

646
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,399
so i think we have a similar section

647
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,120
in the different ipv6 over four

648
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,720
specifications

649
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,640
in the text in the body of the document

650
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,559
so not in an annex

651
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,279
so i understand that well there are like

652
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:27,760
different

653
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,480
figures and it's quite informational as

654
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,080
the reviewer says

655
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,520
but well i wouldn't see

656
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,799
an issue in keeping that section in the

657
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,799
body of the document but well perhaps

658
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,120
that's just my opinion

659
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,399
uh okay so you think it is it might be

660
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,360
okay to keep it

661
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
right i i think so but

662
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,159
well i'm not sure if there can be

663
00:30:52,159 --> 00:31:04,399
different opinions here

664
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,080
okay so maybe let's move on

665
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,559
so the the second comment from robert is

666
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,679
that the

667
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,080
discussion of id mapping the security

668
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,960
consideration

669
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,240
is not enough thus we've added more

670
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,679
clear reference to uh

671
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,960
the rfc uh 80 65

672
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,799
talking about the privacy strikes and

673
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,240
gives solutions

674
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,279
from the itf rfcs

675
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,760
robert singh that thinks that the text

676
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,559
is better but

677
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,279
needs more review from people with more

678
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,480
expertise

679
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,760
so maybe he's not

680
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,360
confident enough about this modification

681
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,399
and next

682
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,039
slide please

683
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,480
thank you so the third comment is

684
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,159
similar to the previous one

685
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,240
but regarding to this database id

686
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,600
generation in the

687
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,960
subsection 4.1

688
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,240
so roberts thinks that we use

689
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,679
rcr 2464 to generate the id from the

690
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,640
short link layer address and this way is

691
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,960
conflict to the rca

692
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,840
80 64. and rc864 reveals that

693
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,559
the a clear and direct mapping between

694
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,279
the

695
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,000
link layer address and the id may have

696
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,679
privacy issues

697
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,039
and actually uh the problem has been

698
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,679
solved

699
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,480
by six though in drc

700
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,120
8065

701
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,880
the solution can be a stateless hash

702
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,840
which takes a

703
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,519
short address and a secret k

704
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,559
to increase as the input of the hash

705
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,960
and after the hash you can have

706
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
you can fully use the entropy of the

707
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,120
the range of the id space so we think

708
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,880
that we will change the reference

709
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,399
from the reference to rfc uh

710
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,960
at 64 into the reference to rfc

711
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,360
8065 so that we can have

712
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,880
the a more concrete solution

713
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,679
to deal with the privacy's rights so

714
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,960
the last comment is about an

715
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,360
ambiguous disk description on the

716
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,200
encryption key in zdr2

717
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,240
we think this sentence is redundant and

718
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,360
we will remove it in the next update

719
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,959
so next page please

720
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,960
yeah thank you the review from the

721
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,600
transport area is from joseph

722
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,000
in the first comment joseph indicates a

723
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,960
written description on the reference to

724
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,720
the rfc 4944 in two different

725
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,760
sections we will remove one of them

726
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,440
in the next version the second comment

727
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,719
is about the concern about

728
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,359
the 16 bit tag in the fragmentation

729
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,599
actually the rc 4963

730
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,800
raises an issue that with the data rate

731
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,520
is high

732
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,480
the 16 bit tag is not enough to guide

733
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,560
the correct rear assembly of the syn

734
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,599
packet

735
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,839
however in constraint plc network which

736
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,199
is used in

737
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,639
the lte scenario the threshold data rate

738
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,159
cannot be reached

739
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,960
however josef suggests to add more

740
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
description in the craft

741
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,719
just as a reminder and

742
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,759
next page please

743
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,960
the review from the ops area is done by

744
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,160
uh it's from dan actually and

745
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
he's curious about the operation and the

746
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,359
management of the constraint plc network

747
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,079
and we've explained that the constraint

748
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,480
plc networks are designed to be

749
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,760
self-organized and self-managed and they

750
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,480
the management is different from some

751
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,000
traditional network

752
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,960
like uh enterprise network or career

753
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,079
network

754
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,760
and actually itf is working on more

755
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,040
features

756
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,960
on the management of lt networks in the

757
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,200
recently formed ltops working group

758
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
which is aimed to design more features

759
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
for the management

760
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,720
of iot networks then suggest that we may

761
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,760
add a subsection uh talking about

762
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,880
the operation and the management of the

763
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,599
plc

764
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,520
network and we think that we can add a

765
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,000
very short

766
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,400
subsection talking about the plc network

767
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,839
is self-organized and self-managed

768
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,920
and how we can for example view

769
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,000
the topology or all the devices online

770
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,760
by the gateway for example and

771
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,599
no more comments comes from the general

772
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,599
area and will update

773
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,119
the draft according to these comments

774
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,640
in the in the next version

775
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,680
very very soon so uh any comments

776
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,190
on this on these

777
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,340
[Music]

778
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
statues

779
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,599
so thank you remy for the presentation

780
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,280
and all the feedback so then

781
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,040
eric if we have it correctly then

782
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,359
we guess that once there's the new

783
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,880
version of the draft

784
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,359
then the next step would be the

785
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,400
evaluation by the isd

786
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,599
yeah oh some good cars

787
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,640
yeah i think carlos uh you're the

788
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,320
shepherd for the documents so i can just

789
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,880
wait till you tell me that uh

790
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,160
draft six or seven or however many

791
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,359
updates

792
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,640
are necessary to incorporate the

793
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,320
feedback let me know when it's ready to

794
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,480
go

795
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,160
okay thank you i will do unless you feel

796
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,800
like

797
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,200
none of this seems sufficiently

798
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,880
substantial to warrant a second last

799
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
call to me

800
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,920
so yeah i think just

801
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,400
put it on the telechat when you have a

802
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,359
draft that

803
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,599
addresses all this perfectly yes so

804
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,839
we'll proceed as per what you said

805
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,480
so anyone from the use case draft

806
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,440
young kyung yes

807
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,280
okay this is the circle

808
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,480
of three and used accent

809
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,680
so i want to mention that

810
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,640
we have the change of the author's

811
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,760
information

812
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,440
in the previous version we had

813
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,280
the take and shoot from modio av

814
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,359
but we try to contact

815
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,440
the tech and shoot but it is impossible

816
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,040
to contact him so

817
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,480
we moved him from the author

818
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,599
list to acknowledgement section so it is

819
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,560
the

820
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,760
change of the author list okay please

821
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,480
next page

822
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,359
yeah uh this is the history and status

823
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,000
and as

824
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,280
you can see uh it is a

825
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,720
very long time ago to start this work

826
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,160
so now we have the 10th version so

827
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,200
this is the update to result the command

828
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
from the second

829
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,000
or working group last call

830
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:30,079
next page please yeah uh in this

831
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,520
trap we have the sixth uh sixth law

832
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,200
lincolnia technology

833
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,880
uh g-wave ple textually mstp

834
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,160
nfc and plc and

835
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,160
the related rfc and interdrive

836
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,680
are as follows as you can see next page

837
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,078
please

838
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,520
yeah uh this is the useful information

839
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,720
to compare

840
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,920
across sixth role in clear technology so

841
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,520
in this table of comparison

842
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,640
we have the gba the led valley

843
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,560
msd nfc and felsi and we

844
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,920
uh tries to

845
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,079
analyze the usage of its technology

846
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,200
and technology and subnet and mobility

847
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,000
requirement

848
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,119
security requirement problem climate and

849
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,359
etc

850
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,319
next page please

851
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,160
yeah during the second working group

852
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,960
last call

855
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,160
and the shared body parody and pascal

856
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,040
super

857
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,480
and the house gym so

858
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,119
thanks for

859
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,040
there's the good comment so in this

860
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:01,520
phase

861
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,760
i tried to how to reserve

862
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,400
of each command the first one is the

863
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,240
comment from caroline

864
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,720
also as you can see it is the kind of

865
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,680
the

866
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,800
typo and the um is typing so

867
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,240
we are change

868
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,400
the text as the uh carry ring suggest

869
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,680
okay next page please

870
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,560
yes this is the command from as well and

871
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,520
then

872
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,720
so the first comment is that the

873
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,319
title of the on section 5 the original

874
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,359
the title was

875
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,880
guidelines for adopting ipv6 sixth row

876
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,319
and sixth route so he suggests that

877
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,119
uh this left is above sixth row like

878
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,480
other sections so

879
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,040
it is better to use only six law the

880
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,640
section title

881
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,839
just for consistence so uh we follow on

882
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,839
his

883
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,440
the title and change the title into

884
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,160
guidelines for adopting ipv6 rule

885
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,920
and the second comment is that

886
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,160
uh

887
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,800
the certain part of the same section

888
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,560
requires a bit of rewarding

889
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,839
so that the leader appears it is a

890
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:30,880
six-row document

891
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,960
rather than a summary of the sixth

892
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,720
european protocol

893
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,079
so he uh

894
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,440
uh expressed the concern of

895
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,160
concern of the usage of the sixth row

896
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,880
pan

897
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,079
so to reserve this com command

898
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,359
we add the following sentence and at

899
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,400
the beginning of the section there is

900
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,319
sixth law aims at reusing and or

901
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,560
adopting existing sexual pain

902
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,760
functionality

903
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,560
you know in order to efficiently support

904
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,280
ip physics of a variety of ielts

905
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,800
technology and the second

906
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,079
or the third command is that for cyclone

907
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,200
network they use

908
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,319
wired link technologies or short dots on

909
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:18,640
the

910
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,839
pedal and how secure pen can possibly be

911
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,280
adaptive health

912
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,640
so we think that

913
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,480
uh we have or a text of the

914
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,760
wild technology that is a plc so in the

915
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,960
plc

916
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,280
uh section there are already the

917
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,560
relevant text

918
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,760
so we don't need to

919
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,119
add another text for document

920
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,680
and the first command is that the

921
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,920
emergency over banknote ip

922
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,200
as an alternative for pen mstp cannot be

923
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,079
ignored

924
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,000
so he suggests the uses of

925
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,839
so he suggests to add the banknote ip

926
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,800
so we add a couple of sentences at the

927
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,920
end of the

928
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,720
past graph of the first paragraph of the

929
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,160
section 6.4 that is the

930
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,680
mstp section and the

931
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,880
last comment is that refer to

932
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,079
section 6.2 the use case of bluetooth

933
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,680
early smartphone based interaction

934
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,800
so this for sixth law for this use case

935
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,680
is not com

936
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,720
coming out clearly so it would be good

937
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,000
to explain

938
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,200
so we add the sentence in the

939
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,480
the use case of the billy section

940
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,040
there is the sixth row enables this use

941
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,800
case by providing

942
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,640
efficient end to end ipv6 support okay

943
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,839
please go to the space

944
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,800
yes this is a comment from third match

945
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,160
literally

946
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,359
so it is a little to the uh

947
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,960
correct typo and the expression

948
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,160
so we follow

949
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,280
his suggestion as like this

950
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,119
please go to next page

951
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,839
thanks for addressing the comments oh

952
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,720
okay

953
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,920
okay thank you and this is comment from

954
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,040
task car super

955
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,880
so i personally thanks to pascal silvers

956
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,240
because he helped to improve

957
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,000
this threat because he gave many

958
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,160
comments so i want to

959
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,280
explain one by one the first comment is

960
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,319
that

961
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,480
he feel that there are some

962
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,640
should be placed on the grammar by a

963
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,319
native speaker

964
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:58,319
so i and colors to

965
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:01,040
our best to improve the writing of the

966
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,599
document

967
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,160
and the second command is that there are

968
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,280
the uh

969
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,520
this typing of the six row pan so we

970
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,480
change

971
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,839
as he suggests and the third command

972
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,520
is that he uh suggests to update

973
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,920
their discovery optimization for sexual

974
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,160
pain rfc

975
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,680
675 to include rfc

976
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,560
l505 so we update the reference of rfc

977
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,319
8505 and

978
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,839
he suggested the section two so

979
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
section two was to convention and

980
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,680
terminology section

981
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,160
so yes we check there this is the

982
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
informational

983
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,079
draft so we delete section two

984
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,520
and uh uh

985
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,040
fifth command is that uh he suggests

986
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,079
that the

987
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,119
bluetooth c and ip link so

988
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:05,680
we uh discussed uh this issue from

989
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,560
among us so we conclude that the ip

990
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,319
link it is difficult to find

991
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,079
the information in the public space

992
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,559
so there seems to be no public available

993
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,720
information regarding the ip link at

994
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,119
first

995
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,280
so we would like to add information on

996
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,280
that but only as long as

997
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,800
it is public available so it is our

998
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,920
response okay now go to next page please

999
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,720
and the

1000
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,559
sixth command is that the g3

1001
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,319
plc is dead so g3 plc

1002
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,359
used on escape to the six row pan and

1003
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,720
you discuss in the section 4.1 so why

1004
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,119
not

1005
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,400
a word with a course reference here

1006
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,440
so as he to

1007
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,079
resolve this command we add a short text

1008
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,760
of c3prc

1009
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,200
and our reference and the seventh

1010
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:07,760
command

1011
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,880
was that uh the section paul

1012
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,359
has denied 9903 and the death risky

1013
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,200
but he want to add the white sun

1014
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,440
so you know though in the previous

1015
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,760
version of our draft we

1016
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,760
have the white sun section but

1017
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:35,839
the previous thread

1018
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,839
could you hear me

1019
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,640
yeah thank you so

1020
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,160
uh in the previous section or we had the

1021
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,520
white sun

1022
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,800
part but to make it compact

1023
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,920
of our draft we are delete so rice learn

1024
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,640
and the website is based on i triple

1025
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,520
edit rapid in that port technology

1026
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,800
so both of the passcode

1027
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,000
suggests that he is better to

1028
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,319
include the white sun section so we

1029
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,960
restore the section of the white sun

1030
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,760
in the update version and the eighth

1031
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,480
comment

1032
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,720
was that the

1033
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,680
the factory automation so we found that

1034
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,079
uh

1035
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,640
the text of factory automation was

1036
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,920
already exist

1037
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,640
so we used no action for this command

1038
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,920
the nice comment was that

1039
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,040
the uh the missing of the

1040
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,280
thread so i know that the thread also

1041
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,480
uses i3

1042
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,720
is based on i briefly edited the 15.4

1043
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,160
so we have some concern about that

1044
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,119
this document this draft is targeting on

1045
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:07,680
the

1046
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,800
sixth row that are the sixth row ten

1047
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,880
and

1048
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,760
but to follow to

1049
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,640
reserve his grant we add a section of

1050
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,160
thread

1051
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,280
and the tenth command was that of

1052
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,480
the section 5 is really neat and useful

1053
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,160
so he loved to see it earlier so

1054
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,760
we adjust the location section 5 earlier

1055
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,839
okay next page please

1056
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,480
and eleventh command was that uh

1057
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,920
the uh six row pen at the andy and

1058
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,680
he suggests to broadcast

1059
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,720
or avoidance the blade so to reserve

1060
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,520
this command

1061
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,480
we follow his suggest and we add the

1062
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,440
jubilee

1063
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,640
broadcast avoidance

1064
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:10,079
and the uh

1065
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,680
surps comment was that some the uh

1066
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,920
host route interface and the proxy level

1067
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,720
discovery

1068
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,400
uh uh there so we add

1069
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,200
post to router interface read and

1070
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,640
fractional discovery

1071
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,680
and the third com certain comment

1072
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,359
was that uh it is released to ap

1073
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,559
nd so we update the reference

1074
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,480
and the first command was that uh

1075
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,839
the uh sixth group and nd

1076
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,640
and the address or assignment related so

1077
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,800
we update the relevant text in the

1078
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,800
address assignment read

1079
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,240
and the pip's comment was there but uh

1080
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,920
we think that there we

1081
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,160
need we don't need to

1082
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,520
action so okay

1083
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,800
go to next page please

1084
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,480
and uh this comment was the whole thing

1085
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,280
the drag

1086
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,040
so he suggests some

1087
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,480
uh typo and the expression

1088
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,160
so it's i think that it is a little

1089
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,040
divider

1090
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,640
so we change the text as he proposed

1091
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,000
okay next page please

1092
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,880
so it is the conclusion of our the

1093
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,160
toc in the previous version we had the

1094
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,280
section two convention and terminology

1095
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,400
and the update version we deleted

1096
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,280
section two and the passcode says that

1097
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:57,760
the

1098
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,640
previous version of guidelines for

1099
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,040
adopting ipv6 stack

1100
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,480
it is located in section 5

1101
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,520
but in the new version it is moved to in

1102
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,079
the

1103
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,839
section 3. next page please

1104
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,160
yes as the past

1105
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,640
command we update the full paragraph to

1106
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,119
improve the writing of the document

1107
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,319
and we add two or six law

1108
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,280
deployment scenario one is the license

1109
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,680
and the other is to thread

1110
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,160
and we update the appearance part to

1111
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:40,839
include

1112
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:44,000
i3 1901

1113
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
top 1 and g3 plc

1114
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,119
okay next page please

1115
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
and we found that uh after uh submitting

1116
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,400
the

1117
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,920
tenth version uh we had a comment from

1118
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:02,240
the

1119
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,839
tarot kibby nin uh he

1120
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,000
suggests to include i33 edit ortuda pip

1121
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,200
titan 9

1122
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,240
but unfortunately in the author

1123
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,400
we don't have any expert to regarding

1124
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,400
i338 or 59

1125
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,520
but in the update version we

1126
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,440
try to reserve this comment

1127
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,960
so thanks and so oh that's all

1128
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:39,839
thank you

1129
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:49,200
thank you i don't see anybody in the

1130
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,240
queue so

1131
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,640
let's move on to the next topic uh

1132
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,400
carlos

1133
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,440
she had a compression

1134
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,839
okay hello again so

1135
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:07,200
uh again as a working group participant

1136
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,200
i'm going to give this presentation

1137
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,799
about the idea of using

1138
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,440
chic heather compression in six law

1139
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,720
environments

1140
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:20,400
next please

1141
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,000
um first of all uh about the motivation

1142
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,040
for this idea we have

1143
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,400
uh the rfc 6282 has been the basis for

1144
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,760
header compression

1145
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,720
in six load pan and also in 6 low this

1146
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,079
rfc was designed

1147
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,440
for 15.4 as the target technology below

1148
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,720
ipv6

1149
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,520
and it has also been adapted or reused

1150
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,079
for

1151
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,880
relatively similar iot technologies such

1152
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,720
as the ones that we

1153
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,200
deal with in six low like bluetooth low

1154
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,160
energy

1155
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,440
nfc and so on so um

1156
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,559
with 62a2 it is possible

1157
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,400
to compress an ipv6 udp header of 48

1158
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,960
bytes down to a size of 7 bytes assuming

1159
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,400
the best case and with global addresses

1160
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,720
and on the other hand recently there has

1161
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,480
been the publication of another

1162
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,760
specification

1163
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,440
which is rfc 8724 this is

1164
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,079
also known as chic this stands for

1165
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,920
static context header compression and

1166
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,119
fragmentation

1167
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,280
which is a product of the lp1 working

1168
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,480
group

1169
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,200
so this specification provides

1170
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,000
adaptation layer

1171
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,640
functionality and offers both header

1172
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,359
compression

1173
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:37,040
and fragmentation functionality so

1174
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,359
this specification chic has been

1175
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:40,480
designed for

1176
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,920
technologies which are even more

1177
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,480
constrained than the ones typically

1178
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:44,960
handled

1179
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,839
in six load pan or six load specifically

1180
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,319
those

1181
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,440
are the lp1 technologies low power wide

1182
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,280
area network technologies

1183
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,319
like sigfox lora1 narrowband iot

1184
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,079
and so on which are actually more

1185
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,240
constrained than the typical

1186
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,000
six lower six lowpan ones so if we focus

1187
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,720
on the header compression part here of

1188
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,760
chic

1189
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,400
by using sheik it's possible to compress

1190
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,440
a 48

1191
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,359
byte ipv6 udp header down to a size of

1192
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:17,680
something like just one byte again

1193
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,200
assuming the best case with global

1194
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,079
addresses

1195
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,200
and this is because she uses

1196
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,640
static context which exploits a priori

1197
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,200
knowledge

1198
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,720
of header field values so if one knows

1199
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,319
beforehand which will be the

1200
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,119
values of the different header fields

1201
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,880
then it's possible to achieve

1202
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,079
this very efficient compression so

1203
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,640
next please

1204
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,160
okay so then if we look at the

1205
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,280
application

1206
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,839
layer protocols as well it turns out

1207
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:52,960
that there has been

1208
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,079
no six low or six low pan defined header

1209
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,680
compression for an application layer

1210
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,640
protocol

1211
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,400
like co-op and in that case if

1212
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,599
we want to compress the ipv6 udp and

1213
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,799
co-op headers

1214
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:09,839
the result would be a size

1215
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,280
of 11 bytes if we use rfc

1216
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,319
6282 like the the 6lowpan traditional

1217
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,040
one

1218
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,839
and we cannot actually compress the cob

1219
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:20,720
header

1220
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,960
so that's assuming again the best case

1221
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,280
with global addresses and assuming that

1222
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,280
there are no co-op header options

1223
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,839
then the resulting size would be 11

1224
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:32,960
bytes

1225
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,680
but it's actually possible to use chic

1226
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,119
to compress

1227
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,440
the header of quad and in fact there is

1228
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,559
a document that just

1229
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,119
recently entered the rfc editor queue

1230
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,960
produced by the lp1 working group which

1231
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,880
specifies how to do so

1232
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,240
and in that case it would be possible

1233
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,040
again with no cop header options and

1234
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,040
best case global addresses

1235
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,079
to compress the ipv6 udp

1236
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,640
and co-op headers down to a format of

1237
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,880
just the two bytes

1238
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,119
and well actually the improvement could

1239
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,079
be greater

1240
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,960
uh meaning that the uncompressed header

1241
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,839
sizing co-op

1242
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,000
can be of greater size depending on the

1243
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,440
use case okay

1244
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,680
but well uh assuming these conditions we

1245
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,559
would have

1246
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,240
the results that we can see on the slide

1247
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,990
so next please

1248
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,040
[Music]

1249
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,319
so here we can see

1250
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,799
on the left we can see the protocol

1251
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,720
stack that's the traditional

1252
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,559
six load plan based protocol stack

1253
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,920
and on the right we can see what we

1254
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,000
plan to do here and the idea would be

1255
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,200
that well perhaps in some cases

1256
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,359
we might want to use chic for header

1257
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,319
compression

1258
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,960
instead of the traditional 6lowpan

1259
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,880
header compression

1260
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,839
so to to be clear the idea would not be

1261
00:59:57,839 --> 00:59:58,400
trying to

1262
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,119
obsolete 6lowpan header compression the

1263
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,240
idea would be

1264
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,359
offering an alternative way of doing

1265
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:06,559
header compression

1266
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:09,760
but now in environments which typically

1267
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,720
would be considered

1268
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:14,880
six lower six low pan like environments

1269
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,440
next please

1270
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,040
so uh we might make ourselves the

1271
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,599
question

1272
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,440
of okay uh should or might we

1273
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,440
use chic header compression for this

1274
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,240
kind of six low single pan environments

1275
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,280
and well uh some of us believe that the

1276
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:35,839
answer

1277
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,680
is yes at least for some of these

1278
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,960
environments

1279
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,040
and there's related background materials

1280
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,000
in the couple of

1281
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,559
individual drafts that you can see on

1282
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,920
the screen

1283
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,119
and also these ideas were already

1284
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,839
presented in couple of previous itf

1285
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,799
meetings

1286
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,200
and we believe that there was positive

1287
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,400
feedback actually

1288
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,920
from this idea and well if the

1289
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,839
answer to the question in the title is

1290
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:02,960
yes

1291
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,240
then for the sake of coexistence with

1292
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,200
existing

1293
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,760
networks existing implementations and

1294
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,200
interoperability

1295
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,520
we need to signal when chic header

1296
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,359
compression is used

1297
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,400
so to do that we can

1298
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,520
follow the approach shown on the slide

1299
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,880
which is defining some frame format

1300
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,520
uh which in this case would be placed as

1301
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,599
the lead to frame payload

1302
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,680
which uh would correspond to some

1303
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,000
encapsulated chip compressed packet

1304
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,559
and as you can see the the first field

1305
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,440
the leftmost

1306
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,559
field would be a dispatch indicating

1307
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,319
that what comes next is a sheet

1308
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:44,079
compressed packet

1309
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,319
and at the right of the dispatch we

1310
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,520
would have the

1311
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,200
sheet packet with the possibly

1312
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,040
compressed header

1313
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,839
and then the payload next please

1314
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,960
so there is one specific proposal

1315
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,160
for the dispatch that i was mentioning

1316
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,200
right now so the proposal is in the

1317
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,720
individual draft that you can see in the

1318
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,000
first bullet

1319
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,960
and the idea here is to define some

1320
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:15,599
specific

1321
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,880
six load band dispatch type for chic

1322
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,400
so here the proposal is to use

1323
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,240
the rfc 8025 concept of page

1324
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,079
and use uh actually dedicate

1325
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,599
a whole page for chic to keep low

1326
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,480
overhead

1327
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,359
and considering that currently pages are

1328
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,400
mostly

1329
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,799
unused except for page zero and

1330
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,640
partially page one

1331
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,680
and the idea here would be to use a

1332
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,680
paging dispatch which is the

1333
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,839
one byte pattern that you can see

1334
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,520
starting by four ones and then

1335
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,520
a number of well four bits to be

1336
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,760
determined we could use that

1337
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,799
as uh the sheet dispatch so the signal

1338
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,559
open dispatch type which would indicate

1339
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,000
that next what comes next

1340
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,359
is a sheet compressed packet

1341
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,720
so um then assuming that we

1342
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,119
follow this path and we use this sort of

1343
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,039
dispatch for chic

1344
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,920
then okay which could be the potential

1345
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:17,039
performance improvement

1346
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,319
that we might achieve still considering

1347
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,880
the same

1348
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,240
conditions mentioned earlier well in the

1349
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,599
traditional way we could compress ipv6

1350
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:30,000
udp header by using 6282 and then we

1351
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,760
would have the co-op header

1352
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,559
and under those conditions mentioned the

1353
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,920
size

1354
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,240
of the resulting header would be 11

1355
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,440
bytes

1356
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,720
whereas if we take this one byte sheet

1357
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,440
dispatch

1358
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,680
plus then the sheet compressed header

1359
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,319
which would be of two bytes in that case

1360
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,839
then the result will be a format of

1361
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,599
three bytes and

1362
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,359
of course well we have this a by

1363
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,119
difference so

1364
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,280
we are sending or receiving less bytes

1365
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,039
with the chic approach so in that case

1366
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,720
imagine that we have some battery

1367
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,720
operated device

1368
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,640
which is specifically sending some

1369
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,920
message

1370
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,200
some packet then it would be possible to

1371
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,839
well in theory to achieve a battery

1372
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:16,480
lifetime

1373
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,839
increase by up to 40

1374
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:23,920
over 15.4 considering any topology like

1375
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,640
well for example mesh topologies but if

1376
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:27,920
we consider

1377
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,200
the star topology where there's the

1378
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,960
pan coordinator address that is not

1379
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,640
present in the frame size so then the

1380
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,760
frame is shorter

1381
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,760
then the impact of this potential

1382
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,000
improvement is slightly greater

1383
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,480
and it might reach theoretically up to

1384
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,079
44

1385
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,520
so well we need to be aware that anyway

1386
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,319
the

1387
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,520
improvement in a more realistic setup

1388
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,920
uh will be lower so these numbers here

1389
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,039
are just like

1390
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,119
asymptotic values upper bounds okay so

1391
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,720
there are different parameters and

1392
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,319
different things that will uh

1393
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,559
influence on which is the actual

1394
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,079
improvement which will be lower than

1395
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:07,359
these numbers

1396
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,240
like payload size as you will see later

1397
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,280
so improvement will

1398
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,760
tend to increase with payload size then

1399
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,599
mclear settings will have some influence

1400
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,160
as well

1401
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,880
because we might use short or long mac

1402
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,520
addresses

1403
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,280
or perhaps in some cases we don't have

1404
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,880
ling lay acknowledgements but in some

1405
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,319
others we do

1406
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,720
also the actual hardware features will

1407
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:27,760
be relevant

1408
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,799
because well we usually have a non-zero

1409
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:31,200
sleep

1410
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:33,119
current consumption even if it's

1411
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:34,559
typically the order of just

1412
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,680
few micron pair and also things like

1413
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,520
transitions from sleep state to transmit

1414
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,960
or receive uh also consume some

1415
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,359
amount of non-negligible amount of

1416
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,039
energy okay

1417
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,599
and then other parameters here could be

1418
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:52,480
like

1419
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,559
application settings like how often does

1420
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,640
the device transmit a packet

1421
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,760
well uh all this being said well

1422
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,839
uh if we can move to the next slide

1423
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:05,839
please

1424
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,920
well then first of all here we have

1425
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,160
some figure showing on the vertical axis

1426
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,000
the amount of bytes

1427
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,559
which would be transmitted or received

1428
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,319
at the physical layer

1429
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,200
under the assumed conditions with six

1430
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:23,760
low pan

1431
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,520
say the traditional way of header

1432
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,359
compression and the chic

1433
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,799
one so well uh these are

1434
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:32,880
actually results not affected by all

1435
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,680
these factors i was mentioning right now

1436
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,240
uh you can see there's the eight bytes

1437
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,440
constant difference

1438
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,520
here and you can guess that well the

1439
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,559
relative impact

1440
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,480
of the performance improvement will tend

1441
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,400
to decrease as

1442
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,119
the co-op payload size on the horizontal

1443
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,000
axis

1444
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,480
increases okay so next please

1445
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:00,160
so here we can see the maximum lifetime

1446
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,839
improvement factor

1447
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,559
so this would correspond to the lifetime

1448
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,000
when

1449
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,119
some battery operated sensor is

1450
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,520
periodically sending a message over 15.4

1451
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,559
in one case it's by using chic and then

1452
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:18,400
we divide it by the lifetime

1453
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,520
when instead we use the traditional way

1454
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,880
and this is the result so again you can

1455
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,079
see how

1456
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,280
as we increase uh sorry the horizontal

1457
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,200
axis label is incorrect it's not udp

1458
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,720
it's collapsed okay

1459
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,760
and well as you can see uh well the

1460
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,280
performance that can be achieved

1461
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,240
decreases

1462
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,440
with payload size but still can be

1463
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,720
somewhat significant

1464
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,720
for some uh somewhat not so small

1465
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,520
payload size

1466
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,559
okay so perhaps this could be useful and

1467
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,400
well we definitely need to take into

1468
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,920
account that the actual improvement

1469
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,559
again

1470
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,400
will be lower than the numbers shown

1471
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,760
here which are just the

1472
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,240
upper bounds the theoretical ones okay

1473
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:00,880
and

1474
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:03,520
next please

1475
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,720
there is by the way if we consider the

1476
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,319
star topology scenario

1477
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:11,680
there is the particular characteristic

1478
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,599
of having the involvement of the pan

1479
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:14,960
coordinator

1480
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,198
when we transmit or receive a frame

1481
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:18,960
where there's the pan coordinator

1482
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,920
as one endpoint then the address of the

1483
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,679
pan coordinator is not included so we

1484
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,080
can

1485
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,000
still have a little bit more of

1486
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,679
improvement in theory

1487
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:30,239
next please

1488
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,479
so if we want to enable something like

1489
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:35,359
this

1490
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,319
then what do we need well first we may

1491
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:38,960
need

1492
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,359
some six load band dispatch type to

1493
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,960
indicate that what comes next

1494
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,399
is a chic compressed packet so this

1495
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,120
dispatch probably would not be specific

1496
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,399
to any particular

1497
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,279
underlying l2 technology so it would be

1498
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:55,198
quite generic

1499
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,839
then we may want to handle padding

1500
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:58,479
because

1501
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,799
a sheet compress header might have a

1502
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,600
size which

1503
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,238
is perhaps not always a multiple of an

1504
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:05,359
l2 world

1505
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,640
by the way l2 word is a quite lp1eh

1506
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,679
working group uh term which would mean

1507
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:12,000
the

1508
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,238
minimum quantum of information that's

1509
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,359
handled by some

1510
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,920
layer 2 technology so for example if we

1511
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,560
have a

1512
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,040
byte-oriented technology then that

1513
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,799
technology can only handle

1514
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,120
bytes right one byte is the minimum

1515
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,520
amount of information

1516
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,880
so then perhaps we may need to consider

1517
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,520
whether

1518
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,560
padding needs to be specified or could

1519
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,759
be specified like in

1520
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:38,719
more generic terms or maybe not that's a

1521
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:39,520
question

1522
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,560
and another point is how we provide the

1523
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:43,359
context

1524
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:45,759
to the devices so there could be

1525
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,198
different approaches like

1526
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,520
pre-provisioning or using out-of-band

1527
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,920
beans or using some sort of dynamic

1528
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,640
approach

1529
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,719
and in that case that would not be so

1530
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:55,840
static

1531
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,640
and anyway well we may want to look at

1532
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,040
the

1533
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,040
solutions that may come from the lp1

1534
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,320
working group

1535
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,120
because this working group is also

1536
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,920
considering the same problem

1537
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,960
so next please

1538
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,520
[Music]

1539
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,080
yeah then there's another option to use

1540
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:16,640
chic

1541
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,960
in six low or six low pan like

1542
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,080
environments

1543
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,880
which would keep compatibility with

1544
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,239
existing

1545
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:28,000
layer 3 header compression mechanisms

1546
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
for example well two eight two and then

1547
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,920
one eight one three eight four round

1548
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:32,320
over

1549
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,360
mesh and um well

1550
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,800
as a reminder there exists two lowpan

1551
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,239
nhc formats defined

1552
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:44,480
in 6282 one intended to allow

1553
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,719
header compression of ipv6 extension

1554
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:47,600
headers

1555
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,800
the other one for udp header compression

1556
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,080
and well perhaps one idea if one wants

1557
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,560
to

1558
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,080
keep using the same mechanisms for

1559
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,440
header compression

1560
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,760
uh like six three two and one eight one

1561
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,280
three eight could be

1562
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,480
to use chic to compress apple ear

1563
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,120
headers

1564
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,280
meaning for protocols like udp or

1565
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,640
perhaps udp co-op

1566
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,199
and so on and we could define like a

1567
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:13,840
third

1568
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,199
lopan nhc format which could be a chic

1569
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,840
open nfc format indicating that what

1570
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,800
comes next

1571
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,960
is sheet compressed so

1572
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,840
next please

1573
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,480
well so that's the end of the

1574
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,280
presentation

1575
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,320
so we would like to know uh what

1576
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,480
does the working group think about this

1577
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,400
whole set of ideas

1578
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,400
uh do you think that this could be

1579
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,520
interesting

1580
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,719
to consider would you have any comments

1581
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:55,840
any suggestions

1582
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,679
yeah uh no i

1583
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,560
am from the sick world but i think it's

1584
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,679
a good thing to

1585
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,480
to establish links between these two

1586
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,120
technologies

1587
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,960
[Music]

1588
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,840
okay thank you

1589
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,239
and i think so too but i'm not

1590
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:05,280
independent either

1591
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,480
okay thank you dominique

1592
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,239
so any other comments

1593
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,600
on my side i like it as well i like this

1594
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,600
approach that allows for

1595
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,159
interoperability between the two

1596
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,640
different technologies

1597
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,040
having these parts to indicate that

1598
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,519
whether or not

1599
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,120
quite interesting

1600
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,120
thank you thank you

1601
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:40,880
so there are a number of comments on the

1602
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,400
chat uh

1603
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,320
by bob muskovitz seems just a good thing

1604
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,120
to do

1605
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,000
but receiving is always a good thing and

1606
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,239
serious mentioning that well he thinks

1607
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:56,640
it's also a good option

1608
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,760
so any other comments

1609
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,440
so lauren are you still in the queue

1610
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:15,840
okay then pascal

1611
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,640
um yeah i also support the work we

1612
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,360
discussed it during the lp one interims

1613
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,760
and uh there was a discussion on whether

1614
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,560
some people would

1615
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,159
like to do the 6282 compression

1616
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,920
for ip and then use chic for co-op

1617
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,960
and for one thing it's not very clear

1618
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,360
how you would encode that in the packet

1619
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,000
but most of all i believe that if we

1620
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:42,640
start

1621
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,880
doing check and if you support shaking

1622
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,000
the node

1623
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,040
then it's better to compress both ip and

1624
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,000
co-op using shakes so i'm not convinced

1625
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,640
that there is there is value in just

1626
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,640
compressing co-op i really support the

1627
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:57,760
work but

1628
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,600
i believe the most useful case is when

1629
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,360
you compress both ip

1630
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,760
and co-op let's just

1631
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,679
say thank you very much

1632
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,920
yeah this is dominic again uh i agree

1633
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,800
with you pascal

1634
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,719
i think you get more benefit by

1635
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,360
compressing everything in one go

1636
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,040
um have some doubts on how we apply the

1637
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,360
address compression then because in

1638
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,960
chic we assumed that we have an

1639
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,640
asymmetric link with

1640
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,560
a device and a core network

1641
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,520
and here we have a peer relation so let

1642
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:39,920
me

1643
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,960
think about that unless you have

1644
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,760
an idea ready

1645
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:49,600
well we we i believe we haven't thought

1646
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,400
about

1647
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,640
this point but yeah definitely a very

1648
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,679
good point

1649
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,600
so we'll need to to think about it

1650
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,239
well if i may when you think about the

1651
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:02,000
chic over ppp

1652
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,080
approach we are not in the same model

1653
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,800
where you have a gateway and the device

1654
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,440
we are

1655
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,480
in a peer-to-peer model and it

1656
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,520
might be that the the model

1657
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,840
for chicago is more like the chic of our

1658
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,000
ppp

1659
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,360
where any there is no specific role i

1660
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,960
mean this kind of more peers appear

1661
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,000
the bottom line is you would need to use

1662
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,760
the mac address or something to know

1663
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,480
who is compressing what and so so it's

1664
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:39,120
it's

1665
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,080
at some point if you want to compress

1666
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,239
something like the ip address then then

1667
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,800
you're in trouble of a multi-hop mesh

1668
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,360
because

1669
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,719
the mac address won't tell you what's

1670
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,480
the other side

1671
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,400
uh so in your rules you might not be

1672
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,080
able to fully compress the ip address

1673
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,159
but chick is very very open

1674
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,760
and you can do whatever you like with it

1675
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,520
so if you if you want to compress like

1676
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:00,880
the prefix but not

1677
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,120
the autofs dfsid you can always do that

1678
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,440
i guess right for i understand unless i

1679
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,400
misread something

1680
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,600
right i think so or we may have to

1681
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:17,199
add another cda

1682
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,440
which is possible because check is

1683
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:20,640
extensible

1684
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,080
so it's probably minor trick

1685
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:28,840
to do but yeah we need to think about

1686
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,840
that

1687
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,159
thank you goddess and thanks everyone

1688
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,760
for the feedback so

1689
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,600
would it make sense to get any

1690
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,480
additional volunteers other than carlos

1691
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,040
lauren and anna to work on this so we

1692
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,120
will be publishing

1693
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,040
it does fit into our charter right so

1694
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,159
which

1695
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:02,320
