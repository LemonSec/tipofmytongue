1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
okay

2
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:31,839
giuseppe could you try my check

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
so

4
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,000
starting to feel like we caught

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,680
everybody you know stepping away from

6
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,840
the computer just before the session

7
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
started

8
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
uh so since giuseppe hasn't responded

9
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,200
yali could you also uh do a microphone

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,680
check please

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
could you hear me well we can hear you

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,720
thank you

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,600
thank you can you hear me

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,880
giuseppe you're a little bit quiet

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,919
okay

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,759
it sounds like you're talking to an open

17
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,159
air mic

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,840
let me change

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,799
and hello linda if you could do a

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,079
microphone check while we're waiting to

21
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,878
start that'd be great

22
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,080
can you hear me loud and clear thank you

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:23,840
okay good

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,120
all right we're two minutes into the

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
session so do you want to kick it off or

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
jeff you want to kick it off

27
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,760
i'll go ahead and kick it off today go

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,800
to the

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
folks welcome to the

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,160
wednesday session of idea we've got an

31
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,040
hour

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,440
if you've not read the note well please

33
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,120
do that

34
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,200
care will you show the next slide which

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,079
is the agenda

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,480
our agenda is close for

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,000
an hour so folks uh please be

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
tight uh if we get some more time at the

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,319
end we'll open it up to question

40
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,839
if not waymo you're first go ahead

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,440
hello everyone today i'm going to

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
present the hd

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,080
bgp flute spec for airsoft v6

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,360
next page

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,159
just give a quick review about the

46
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,000
document

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,519
so for ipv6 a packet head

48
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,799
for an sr package it has

49
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
special structures for example

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
its destination is a segment

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,879
id which consists of locate

52
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,400
located field auctions field

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
and arguments so for this special

54
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,560
structure

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,760
we define two new component types

56
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
so one of the type can consist at least

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,319
or for operators

58
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,238
with values to define

59
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,880
matching conditions on this special

60
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,519
field

61
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
such as locator field function field or

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,280
arguments field

63
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
so next page

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,759
so which for this latest version we just

65
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,360
made some editorial changes

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,919
next page

67
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
so we would like a welcome comment and

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
also we would like a request for

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
adoptions

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
yeah that's all for for me today thank

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
you

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
cool joel you're on the mic thank you

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,479
i had apparently not looking

74
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,759
sufficiently closely at this draft

75
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
if you're trying to point explicitly at

76
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,440
the lock field

77
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
and not encoding the length of the lock

78
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,479
field in this

79
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,320
spec then interpretation of

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,080
this piece of flow spec requires

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
processing and using other routing

82
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,280
information

83
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,199
to know how long the lock field is

84
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
yeah good question uh since uh so

85
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,479
in fact because these are actually just

86
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
just a very brief review

87
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,960
and we have uh uh for each operator we

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,560
have a value

89
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,479
so those uh lens for locator and a

90
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,440
function

91
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
is encoded in the lens

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
in in the value of in the in the value

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
field in the

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
variable so can you go to previous

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,000
slides

96
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,400
previous one that picture here we just

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,759
give

98
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,039
details about the operator in fact

99
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,000
where operator has associated with a

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,280
value

101
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,120
so those length field is

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,840
given in data value we have structure

103
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
okay yeah

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,880
yeah thank you so the length the the

105
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
length well it's not in the field type

106
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,639
is in the value that's good enough thank

107
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,120
you

108
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,080
yeah yeah yes yes

109
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,199
super jeff weibo uh my question to you

110
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:35,520
is

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,600
uh this is obviously targeted for

112
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
current srv6 related stuff

113
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
how do you foresee this interacting

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
perhaps with the work

115
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
ongoing in spring for you know the more

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
compact uh formats

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,680
are you expecting this to be a logical

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,919
format that you're expecting to carry to

119
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,520
the new compact formats

120
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
or do you think that you will need a new

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
flow spec for each of those

122
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,039
yeah that's a good question i think uh

123
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,639
uh these are

124
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,440
because we talked about uncompressed i

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
think for compressed one

126
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,479
because that structure may be a uh have

127
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,360
more information

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
will have additional information for

129
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
comprehension

130
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,520
so in that case we need a virtual

131
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,800
extension for

132
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,560
compressed seats right

133
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,039
i that is my question and one of the

134
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,479
possible outcomes

135
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,520
i i think the input i would give

136
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,000
as an individual contributor rather than

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,639
a chair

138
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,360
is that uh one of the things we know

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
about the sr related stuff is that

140
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
the differing formats are going to be a

141
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,919
big challenge and

142
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,160
i think we should understand what we're

143
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,759
looking to get out of flow spec

144
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,240
for the different formats before we go

145
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
choose any specific draft towards it

146
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
uh not so much that your draft doesn't

147
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
solve the srv6 problem

148
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
more that we may want to solve the more

149
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,440
general problem

150
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
yeah i think the first step is a focus

151
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,919
on the uncompressed one because for a

152
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,919
compressed one they're still working in

153
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,440
progress because there are

154
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,479
a number of proposals for compressing

155
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,000
the seats so different uh solution or

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
proposal for compression

157
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,720
they may have different information

158
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,599
attached or added into the destination

159
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,039
or c's

160
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,720
or some of them just put will update the

161
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,360
header some fields open field and flags

162
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
views

163
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,439
that is it thank you

164
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,360
joel you're next

165
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,159
oh sorry i pulled back up the draft and

166
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,959
looked

167
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,519
while i get how the length in the value

168
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,399
type works

169
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,600
for the lock how do you find

170
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
you you actually want to be able to

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,920
explicitly test the funk

172
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,640
and actually

173
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,160
there are multiple problems with

174
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
explicitly testing func separate from

175
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,360
lock

176
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,200
among them that it is not actually

177
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
required that they have meaning

178
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,600
that the encoding is the is constant

179
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,800
across things

180
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,600
that's not what's required by network

181
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,640
programming

182
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,920
and you don't know where the lock is the

183
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,640
length of the value field won't tell you

184
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,200
where

185
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,760
in this thing the lock is and it is not

186
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,640
required

187
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,600
that it be at a constant offset for all

188
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,080
sids used in a given domain even within

189
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,040
srv6

190
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,640
it could be but it's not yeah that's

191
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,839
yeah that's a good question i don't

192
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,839
think this works

193
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
uh this uh because uh

194
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,200
we just provide a this kind of component

195
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,440
and then and they use this one

196
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,560
the user or application will define

197
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,920
define those operators and then the user

198
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
user or application will have more

199
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,640
information about the size of locator

200
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,200
because for some of the because those

201
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,160
applications were used

202
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,720
were targeted for some some fluids

203
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
traffic flows

204
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,839
and then for those traffic flows they

205
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,440
will know they have more

206
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
information about the the locator and

207
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,760
the function

208
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
the interest you can't you can't process

209
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,839
this

210
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,600
without specific information from

211
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,240
elsewhere in the routing system not just

212
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
general config information i wouldn't

213
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,079
care if it required general config

214
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,160
information but you need to actually

215
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
know for this lock

216
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,200
i look at this funny bits to see

217
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,120
that that's the funk if if i have this

218
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,959
prefix on this segment

219
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
on the sid then i look at this many bits

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,279
and that's just not the way

221
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
even floatback has lots of problems but

222
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
but

223
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
i don't think you can do what you're

224
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,560
trying to do here the way you've laid it

225
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,120
out

226
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,519
i think you need to go back again at the

227
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,600
rfc on network programming

228
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,880
and on the encodings

229
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
for how things actually get transferred

230
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,240
remember that for example

231
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,120
the standards for the values of of funk

232
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,640
are not actually standards for the

233
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
values in the packet

234
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,440
they are only standards for the values

235
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
that get

236
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
encoded in the routing protocol that

237
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,920
tell you what the meaning of the sid is

238
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,279
so if you don't even know what the

239
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,040
meanings of the funk bits are unless

240
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,800
you've looked in routing

241
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,680
for the specific lock and it's encoded

242
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
separately for individual

243
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,279
locks so i think that the

244
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,320
srv6 network programming is much harder

245
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,360
to filter

246
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,920
if you want to separate filters if you

247
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,240
just do it as a prefix on the sid

248
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
sure it works i can't argue with that

249
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
and the length of the value will tell

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
you how many bits to test works but if

251
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,639
you want to separate out the funk or the

252
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,839
args

253
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,839
and test them it's not even clear it's

254
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,959
meaningful

255
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,160
as a test and it's not

256
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,480
findable as written joel and lama

257
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,680
i think this is a great i think this is

258
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,320
a great

259
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,720
thing to actually detail on the list

260
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,760
joel

261
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,079
waymo it might be a really good thing to

262
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,120
have

263
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,920
a discussion on this and confirm it

264
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,399
before you ask for working group last

265
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,680
call for working group adoption would

266
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
would you would that be okay because

267
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,279
we're going to

268
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,720
run i know you've got the time no

269
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,800
problem okay okay okay yeah yeah yeah

270
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,240
and also joellen

271
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,000
jolin waymo i think that

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,800
i think that the discussion would also

273
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,839
be valuable

274
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,000
either on idr list uh

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,680
because we're looking at the limitations

276
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,560
of flow spec

277
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,079
you may find that flow spec v1 or just

278
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,440
proposal

279
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,279
for expanding flow spec v1 may take us

280
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,959
into v2 which may provide us

281
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
additional aid so i really would like to

282
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,839
see this on the list because i think

283
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,360
it's beneficial

284
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,480
for our general flow spec thank you both

285
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,639
if we have additional time at the end

286
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,320
we'll open this up

287
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
uh joel and and waymo will come back to

288
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
this

289
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,880
okay thank you so much thank you emma

290
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,880
um next presenter uh linda you've got

291
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,320
two sessions okay so um

292
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,920
here i'm going to uh introduce a new

293
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,639
nlri

294
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,600
address family for the 5g edge computing

295
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
services

296
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,399
our next slide please

297
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,399
so um we presented this in 109

298
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,480
there were quite a few questions on the

299
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,600
list and and also during the discussion

300
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
so i just want to recap what we

301
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,959
discussed

302
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,160
so basically there was a assumption

303
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,800
that all those edge computing servers

304
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,199
they are in the local data network

305
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,560
close to the 5g core network

306
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,600
and the multiple

307
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
servers for one application and

308
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,079
the application prefer to use any cache

309
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,040
address

310
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,199
simply because make it easier for

311
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,240
deployment

312
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,880
so they don't have to readjust addresses

313
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,560
for the application

314
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,680
when they want to move a service from

315
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
one

316
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,440
server location to another with any

317
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,560
cache address

318
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,079
the network itself being leveraged to

319
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
distribute the traffic

320
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
to different um edge nodes

321
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,040
so um the the thing about

322
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,639
in our network itself we a network

323
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,279
network itself has been very good in

324
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,440
using the routing distance

325
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,079
to compute the best path to select to

326
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,480
the

327
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
the best pass and we also have te

328
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,560
traffic engineering taking bandwidth

329
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
into consideration

330
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,440
however for this kind of environment the

331
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
the bandwidth information and the

332
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,199
routing distance

333
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,920
might be similar so there's another

334
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,720
attribute being introduced

335
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,880
which is the running environment that

336
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,279
load information

337
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,279
the those applications themselves are

338
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,560
registered application services not just

339
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,959
every any service attached to the

340
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:55,839
network

341
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,399
only the ones the application that needs

342
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,120
network to

343
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,759
further optimize the distribution among

344
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,959
different locations

345
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,199
and so we introduced a new um

346
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,639
um mri and subtle v to carry those

347
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,320
information so that can help the

348
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
ingress node to choose the uh the

349
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,639
optimal path to the egress

350
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,399
router next page please

351
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,199
okay so um during the 109

352
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,800
and the mailing list discussion there

353
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,079
were three issues being raised

354
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,839
three major issues being erased right so

355
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,880
uh first one is how to select the

356
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,480
optimal egress router um

357
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,240
based on the information received um

358
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
second one is um how the english node

359
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,079
keep the packet

360
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,199
up from one flow to the same server

361
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,800
third one is when the ue moved from one

362
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,600
cell tower to another cell tower and

363
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,800
being anchored

364
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,720
to a different session

365
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
pdu session or they called which is part

366
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,880
of the

367
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
upf user plan function

368
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,599
then they will go through a different

369
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
ingress node how

370
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,280
that flow can be stick to the

371
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,799
the original server okay so

372
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,439
next page please so this meeting just

373
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,559
want to clarify those

374
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,919
issues so first of all um for the past

375
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,880
selection

376
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,600
uh there's assumption here right so only

377
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
for the register services

378
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,559
there's the application controller um

379
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,039
which is

380
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,120
identified in the 3gpp 748 project

381
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,960
the application controller will tell the

382
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
network which services they are

383
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,679
interested

384
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,080
for network to optimize the forwarding

385
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,559
with those information

386
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,360
appropriate acls can be created on the

387
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,400
ingress node

388
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
and other on the egress node uh which

389
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
service to collect

390
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240
and there's a bgp

391
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,440
compute plugin that can compute

392
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,320
the optimal path or best path with the

393
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,440
information

394
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
about the running status in addition to

395
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,919
the routing distance

396
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,480
and the bandwidth information if te is

397
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,919
considered

398
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,280
so that's the assumption um so

399
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,679
this for the past selection that's

400
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,400
basically

401
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
we'll be able to take the application

402
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,160
metadata

403
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,440
um input into consideration so that

404
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,840
um when a destination has three next

405
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,640
hubs

406
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
r1r2 r3 and they can choose

407
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
to the the optimal optimal one

408
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,919
and in terms of forwarding um the

409
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,640
forwarding

410
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,280
the on the bgp compute download the

411
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,720
voting table to the

412
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,679
contract to the forwarding plan the

413
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,799
forwarding plan

414
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,880
will use the existing the flow

415
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
affirmative feature

416
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,080
affinity feature to support

417
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,280
to be able to make one flow goes through

418
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,480
the same path

419
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
this feature is supported by most

420
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,120
commercial routers

421
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,480
and when the ue moves to

422
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
a new uh sale size and

423
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,400
then the the traffic will ingress from a

424
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,440
different

425
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,480
ingress router we have a draft

426
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,640
in six man to show how do we use ipv6

427
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,679
to stick to the same

428
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,120
english egress router and

429
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
also if the ldn is

430
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
hrv6 based that approach

431
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,039
has been um described very clearly

432
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,559
in the six-man apn 6

433
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,760
to show how the srv6 is used

434
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
to stick to the original path

435
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,400
um okay next page please

436
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,000
so in the for the

437
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,679
app metadata information propagation

438
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,799
it's not to be distributed to every node

439
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,080
and the scope of the propagation

440
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,640
can be using we can use the ifc

441
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,280
4684 to constrain the distribution

442
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,320
um but there could be application

443
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,360
servers

444
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,080
many of the services needed so this

445
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,280
could also be

446
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,640
statically configured the application

447
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,679
server id

448
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,880
which is the anycast address and then

449
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,720
with the interested routers

450
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,120
next page please

451
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,880
so so here um

452
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,760
those are the main um subtleties we

453
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,720
propose

454
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,919
uh once the ri has attributes for the

455
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,600
application metadata

456
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,640
and today we only specify

457
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,919
the four sub-tlvs

458
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,600
one is the load measurements

459
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,120
and one is the capacity another one is

460
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,320
the preference

461
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,919
those information um can be either

462
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,520
actually um downloaded or

463
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
exchanged between application controller

464
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,960
to the egress router

465
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,840
or computed by the egress router so

466
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,280
those are out of the scope

467
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,480
how the egress router uh get this

468
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,200
derive those information but those are

469
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
the

470
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,600
roi needed to carry those information

471
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,720
in the future maybe more application

472
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,919
relevant data can be included here

473
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,640
but for now we are asking for working

474
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,840
group adoption

475
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,120
just for those proposed roi and

476
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,639
subjects that's it thank you very much

477
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,840
we've got a little

478
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:13,840
any questions for linda

479
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,679
linda you're on to your next

480
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,360
presentation oh

481
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
okay um so this is the sd1 edge

482
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
discovery this actually will be a very

483
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,760
short presentation

484
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,240
um thank you very much to the working

485
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,039
group

486
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,159
for the valuable feedback and we have

487
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,600
cleaned up the draft

488
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
and so i just want to give you an update

489
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,360
next page please

490
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,919
so this is what we discussed in ietf109

491
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,960
basically we

492
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,159
took the tunnel in cap draft

493
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
the mechanism described in the tunnel in

494
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,280
cap

495
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
draft and now it's probably on the q2ifc

496
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,120
now

497
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,960
using the separating the the underlay

498
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,919
um underlay tunnel property

499
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,919
advertisement from the

500
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,880
client so the client um basically use

501
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
the extended community

502
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,799
to describe the tunnel type and also use

503
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,440
the color

504
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,080
to coordinate correlate with the

505
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,520
underlay property

506
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,880
so um there will be two update two types

507
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,919
of update right

508
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,039
one is the client one is the underlay

509
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,840
um next page please

510
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,440
um so we cleaned up a little bit here uh

511
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,240
basically

512
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,440
if um ipsec um has been

513
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,039
ipsec security association has been

514
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,880
pre-established so instead of attaching

515
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,799
all the ipsec related parameters um

516
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,919
we just include the ipsec ids

517
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,039
and those ids are pre-established and if

518
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:03,760
those uh

519
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,799
episode has a certain uh inner

520
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,159
encapsulation

521
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
we'll attach the proper tunnel

522
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,600
encapsulation subtle beach which

523
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,320
is already described in the tunnel in

524
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,000
cab drive capture

525
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,799
so we i presented this on monday to the

526
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,640
ipsec me

527
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,559
just make sure those kind of

528
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,720
configuration and those kind of

529
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,760
method of carrying the information

530
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,039
doesn't cause any problems with episag

531
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,440
me group and people over there think

532
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
this this is good approach

533
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,840
this is slightly different from the

534
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,080
traditional ipsec configuration

535
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,640
which is always pairwise you always have

536
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,760
two end endnotes

537
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,600
and you have to establish authentication

538
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,880
you have to establish all the related

539
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,080
like traffic selectors admission and

540
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
routing information between the two peer

541
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,279
nodes

542
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,080
with bgp with the route reflector it's

543
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,600
scaled much much better than the

544
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
pairwise

545
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,240
when you have especially when you have a

546
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
large network

547
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,679
and also that with bgp you have

548
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,720
a raw reflector already connected to all

549
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,600
the edge node

550
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,720
through secure channel so the

551
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,760
authentication

552
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,159
is already done before even this being

553
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,000
established

554
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,760
it this before this message to be

555
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,000
exchanged so that's that's a good news

556
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,279
from the episode and e group

557
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,799
um next page please

558
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,320
so um but for the um

559
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,360
secure ipsec security association if it

560
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,080
is

561
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,400
needed to be exchanged through a bgp

562
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,120
update

563
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,440
they can also include it here with

564
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,200
detailed information

565
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,640
like the key sub trvs nouns

566
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,039
and proposals that transform all the

567
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,159
detailed attributes needed by ipsec

568
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,440
they can also be included as a subtle v

569
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,000
in the tunnel exchange

570
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
next page please

571
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,799
so um with a hybrid

572
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,640
hybrid tunnel which can include both

573
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,240
nprs paths and episode path

574
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,840
um this roi is introduced

575
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,559
um basically include the color uh

576
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,760
include the

577
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,200
site type because for hd1

578
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,320
deployment some sites can be far away

579
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,520
it's not like

580
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,000
controlled uh like mpls everything is

581
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,559
within

582
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,799
the within the wall so the site type can

583
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,440
have be

584
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,559
a simpler uh just the node id itself be

585
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,679
able to identify the precise location

586
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,960
there could be in a more diverse

587
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,600
at your geographic location that you

588
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,279
need to include the

589
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:05,039
geolocation information septuali to

590
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,640
indicate

591
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
accurate besides your location and

592
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,600
we have color to correlate with the

593
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,080
client

594
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,600
update next page please

595
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,720
so i we think that this draft

596
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,559
is clean enough and answer many

597
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,559
questions from the working group

598
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,840
and we are ready for working group

599
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
adoption

600
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:49,840
super any questions for linda

601
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,440
thank you so much linda great thank you

602
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,840
and we got four minutes back

603
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,360
in our next presentation uh giuseppe

604
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,480
hello everybody can you hear me okay

605
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,919
yes we can hear you fine okay yeah this

606
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,799
is an update about the bgtsr police

607
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,039
extension for

608
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,640
i fit the graph that's been adopted

609
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,679
during its 109 so next slide

610
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,039
yeah just a few words about background

611
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,159
and motivation

612
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,919
um if it refers to data plane on path

613
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,039
telemetry in particular in c2rm

614
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,120
and alternate marking and you can see

615
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,320
the

616
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,039
document the relevant documents for

617
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,158
these two methodologies

618
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,679
on the other end we we know that an

619
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,760
add-in may be informed about a graduate

620
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,559
part about

621
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,399
by using bgp and you you can also see

622
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,120
the

623
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,279
relevant document by combining these two

624
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,240
bot on part telemetry methodology and

625
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,120
using the

626
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,720
this bgp capabilities we this document

627
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,399
times to define

628
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,039
a new extension to digitally to

629
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,240
distribute

630
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,880
i fit information together together with

631
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
the sr policy this way

632
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,120
the telemetry methods can be

633
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,960
automatically enabled

634
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,000
so next life

635
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,200
yeah in this in this slide we report all

636
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,960
the changes after the working group

637
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,200
adoption in particular we received some

638
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,760
comments on list

639
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,679
during the adoption call firstly

640
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,919
from drew we he suggests to

641
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,000
add more text about the error rambling

642
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,279
actions the

643
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,399
ifit procedures to start stop

644
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,799
update the different type features

645
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,360
and also the backward compatibility that

646
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,279
need to be guaranteed

647
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,760
another comment from katan was more

648
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,559
about the

649
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,960
types of steering that would be possible

650
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,399
to be used

651
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,080
for sr policies and how this is handled

652
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,799
by the srpm

653
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,760
another comment from gun was about the

654
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,000
alignment with the sar policy and tunnel

655
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,279
encapsulation attribute

656
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,559
according to the idr segment drawing fee

657
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,799
policy graph

658
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,799
another comment from mike was common to

659
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,080
the companion draft in pc

660
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,440
regarding the possibility to consider

661
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,600
different effect methods for each

662
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,519
segment list

663
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,919
and we also added some consideration

664
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,960
about that

665
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,240
and in the end we added the new new

666
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,440
fields in the alternate mapping mode

667
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,679
to indicate if the measurement is up by

668
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,120
operant one

669
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,760
next slide

670
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,080
in this slide we summarize the changes

671
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,880
in

672
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,480
the main changes in the zero one version

673
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,519
uh the first one is about the

674
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,320
specification of how happened is

675
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
speeding into a nasa policy

676
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,399
basically it is the same as specifying

677
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,799
in the spring in the spring document on

678
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,679
segment routing policy

679
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,440
so once the airfit attributes are

680
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,559
similar to bgp

681
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
when the packet arrives at the at the

682
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
head and it may get steered into the sr

683
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,399
policy

684
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,720
according to the procedure they find

685
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,600
spring document

686
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,120
and i think methods can be applied of

687
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,840
course

688
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,960
if they are similar regarding the

689
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,080
all the possible cases of i feat

690
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,039
we adopt and in the draft a conservative

691
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,120
strategy so this means that

692
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,320
in case of empty i feed wheels or more

693
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,360
than one instance of the same subjects

694
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,120
or if there are two conflicting

695
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,559
iom subtle these uh if it is not

696
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,360
activated

697
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,840
so it's better to have the conservative

698
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,480
approach

699
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,640
if this is an optional functionality

700
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,799
the regarding the validation as

701
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,320
specified in the

702
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,919
spring document this can be treated as

703
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,760
all the other tlv so the validation can

704
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,480
be added by the srtr

705
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,640
the backward compatibility can be also

706
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,880
guaranteed because

707
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,799
if there is an implementation that does

708
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,279
not understand if it subjects v

709
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,000
it can be simply more and the same

710
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,440
applies for error rendering

711
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,240
actions because as described in segment

712
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,559
routing t policy draft in spring

713
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,279
a bgp speaker must perform the syntactic

714
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,960
validation of the

715
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,080
mli and can determine

716
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,679
if it is good if it is not formal

717
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,559
and if there is an error tritas withdraw

718
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,720
is a good strategy to apply

719
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,279
and these of course apply also to a heat

720
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,720
treat

721
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,039
next

722
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,559
now this is a quick recap about the

723
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,440
draft we

724
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,640
updated the sr policy encoding structure

725
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,360
and the effect attribute you can see

726
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,080
that we

727
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,279
draft added the effect attributes after

728
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,000
the gate at

729
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,600
the candidate part 11 as the subtleties

730
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,720
on the right you can see the format of

731
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,799
the general life it's subtle these and

732
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,320
the the detail of the different options

733
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,600
of the video

734
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,799
currently defined data file

735
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,120
next

736
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,399
yeah in this slide we have the detail of

737
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,639
the situation sub tld so

738
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,239
the top four for the pre-allocated race

739
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,639
option the incremental presuption

740
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,040
directly export option and edge to edge

741
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,320
option

742
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,159
all the fields of course are aligned

743
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,239
with the incident

744
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,280
graph in ippn

745
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
and next

746
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,639
yeah this is the the other subject

747
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,839
related to the alternate marking

748
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,960
as i said we added two new fields the

749
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,000
two flags

750
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,679
uh h and e about that indicated

751
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,760
that the measurement is up by operand

752
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,199
one

753
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,679
and this is also aligned with the rail

754
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,918
around drafting

755
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,719
in ipv6 on data plane about alternate

756
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,719
map

757
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:03,839
next slide please

758
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,960
yeah we added some more consideration

759
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,359
about

760
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,640
the operations uh we defeat attribute

761
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,760
for sr policy

762
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,920
basically we referenced all the

763
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,800
operations

764
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,520
of segment routing key policy draft in

765
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,400
idr

766
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,640
so we just updated

767
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,880
some added some consideration but the

768
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,800
basic operations are

769
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,920
the same uh since a fit attribute

770
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,560
subject are optional they can be

771
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,359
considered

772
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,720
in the mli by a bgp speaker but

773
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,760
of course the implementation may

774
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,839
unsupported subtleties

775
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,119
once the mlris have been accepted have

776
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,000
been considered

777
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,720
acceptable including the afib

778
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,240
information

779
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,359
this can be propagated regarding the

780
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,520
error rambling and the validation

781
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,760
this must be performed to determine if

782
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
they are formed or imbibed

783
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,599
but this is done by the srpm has also

784
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,760
stated in the segment browsing through

785
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,280
policy draft

786
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,280
so next that's like this

787
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,079
is the final slide so we are working

788
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,920
this work is in progress to make the

789
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,280
draft table

790
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,520
of course we welcome questions comment

791
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,640
to improve it

792
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,000
and to go to glide

793
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,320
thank you

794
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,839
any questions for giuseppe

795
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,280
super thank you okay

796
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,839
thank you

797
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,760
and i believe we still have one

798
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,200
presentation more

799
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,439
uh

800
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,359
from yali

801
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,839
i'm trying to get hold of the slides

802
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,119
okay thank you give me a second please

803
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,839
yeah sure

804
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,320
grab this presentation i have them hold

805
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,040
on

806
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,839
yeah can i give you the

807
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,320
screen yep

808
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:19,839
so you got the screen okay

809
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
ugh

810
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,280
this should be ellie do i have the right

811
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,839
presentation

812
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,200
yes but i cannot see the

813
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,040
slide make sure the screen

814
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,640
sure is being started uh i see

815
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
never mind give me a moment to go back

816
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,800
to the screen sharing

817
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,560
give it a second

818
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,680
excuse the few moments of

819
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:15,839
fiddling with this

820
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,200
okay just a minute you'll get the big

821
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,839
screen

822
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,119
yeah i can't see

823
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,480
i'll get you a full screen mode can you

824
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,920
go ahead any time you want

825
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,760
okay thank you uh hello everybody

826
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,520
my name is uh yali wang from huawei

827
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,960
so i'll talk about the draft

828
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,560
to propose to define the bgp extension

829
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,400
for advertising ipad capability

830
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,680
next slide please

831
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,800
do you see ellie yes yeah i think

832
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,480
maybe a little bit delay yeah thank you

833
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,880
so first i am going to describe

834
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,680
requirement

835
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,560
and goals of this uh proposal and then

836
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:22,960
i'll

837
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,520
introduce the definition of iphase

838
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,400
capability

839
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,440
and two optional extensions

840
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:38,480
next page please

841
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,520
your next slide is showing

842
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,200
yes i see it so yeah first of all

843
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,839
uh england uh ifit refers to a family of

844
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,040
data plan on paths

845
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,560
techniques including the in-situ oem and

846
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,760
alternate marking and

847
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,880
i need to indicate that the iphone

848
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,920
capability

849
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,359
of the devices can be manually

850
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,800
configured one by one so hence the

851
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,680
deployment

852
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,119
efficiency is low and menu configuration

853
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,920
may be

854
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,599
incorrect so and

855
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,680
when the i think the capability of the

856
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,079
network devices it changes

857
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,359
for example uh the devices change from

858
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,000
the

859
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,440
supported eye feet uh to uh

860
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,920
non-supported the high feed capability

861
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,720
so the

862
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,960
physical configuration on this device

863
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,800
need to be modified so

864
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,480
based on this uh crashing and issues

865
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,040
here

866
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,720
we propose a extension

867
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,720
to bgp to advertise the

868
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,119
tail nodes iphase capability

869
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,280
so in this one we propose two optional

870
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,040
methods one is to extend to

871
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,160
ipv 4 or v6

872
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,839
address specific extended community

873
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,040
and another one is to

874
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,520
extend to the bgp network capability

875
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,640
so here i want to answer the question

876
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,760
why we

877
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,800
propose list to option

878
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,160
optional extensions as i

879
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,599
uh as i mentioned before we need to

880
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,560
prevent

881
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,240
the information leakage which means that

882
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,359
we we need to avoid

883
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,480
the iv8 data

884
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:50,560
leak outside of the ipad domain

885
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,240
which may cause complete and errors

886
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,839
and another reason is that we need to

887
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,280
determine

888
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,640
uh whether i particular i fade

889
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,839
option types can be uh supported by the

890
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,040
tail nodes

891
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,520
it means that uh depends on the

892
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,560
information

893
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,760
i can decide which kind of the

894
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,079
iv option to be in

895
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,319
encapsulated in the english node

896
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,839
uh yeah this is the reason next page

897
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,839
please

898
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,760
so here we firstly define the

899
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,599
ifit capability format

900
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,880
assuming the figure is formed as the

901
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,480
16-bit bitmap and right now we give the

902
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,160
five flags uh used to

903
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,760
indicate different kind of option types

904
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,760
include the ion and alternate marking

905
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,640
yeah next

906
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,400
okay here uh this is the first option

907
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
extension and this is extension to bgp

908
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,280
extended community so uh

909
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,319
here we give the uh

910
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,680
true scenario firstly is for uh

911
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,720
the ipv 4 network

912
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,480
so let's just define a new type of btp

913
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,560
extended community called ipv4

914
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,000
address specific if a tail community

915
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,839
so it means this it can be used by the i

916
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:42,400
feed

917
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,560
the capsulation node to notify the iphat

918
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,800
capability to is its partner uh i mean

919
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,240
they i think it's encapsulation note uh

920
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,319
it because it is a uh traditive extended

921
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,359
uh unity so we

922
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,480
here we requests to

923
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,240
be allotted the subtype code number

924
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,319
and this another one is for the ipv6

925
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,760
network i think it's a

926
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,040
seminary i mean the seminary matter to

927
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,240
to extend the ipv6 uh

928
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,160
address specific i think tail community

929
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,160
yeah and uh as shown in the figures

930
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,599
or original address

931
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,440
is are defined as the ipv's

932
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,359
i4 address of the f8 capsulation node

933
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,359
and another one is is a ipv6 address of

934
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,119
i fit the capsulation node

935
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,000
next please please

936
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,119
okay this is the second optional

937
00:45:59,119 --> 00:45:59,920
extensions

938
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,680
to a bgp next hub capability

939
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,760
and so here a the bgp next hop

940
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,280
capability attribute uh is an

941
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,960
uh is a non-traditive bgp attribute

942
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,800
so here we it is

943
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,960
modified or deleted when the network may

944
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,560
change it

945
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,440
here we define to reflect the capability

946
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,920
of the next hall

947
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,359
the hub of the iphat capability

948
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,400
so here the capability codes

949
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,560
we defined as a two oct octet

950
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,599
are signed by uh uh

951
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,640
binary intake lim integral

952
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,880
which indicates the type of network

953
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,240
capability

954
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,180
uh uh advertised and

955
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,480
[Music]

956
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,400
to identify an individual capability

957
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,520
and here we request to uh

958
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,280
less code as the i fit next

959
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,480
i face next hub capability and

960
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,560
here we also um to define the original

961
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,319
ip address

962
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,000
uh as the iphas the calculation node

963
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,200
address so so

964
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,400
uh at defined here we can see that

965
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,920
a pdp speaker that can send

966
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,040
an update with this

967
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,880
bgp next hope capability attribute uh

968
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,000
including the ifit network capability

969
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
so the increasing of the iphone x hub

970
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,680
capability with the network

971
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,599
layer reachability information

972
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,119
in the bdp updates indicate that the bdp

973
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,400
next club can act as the

974
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,680
iphat decaf solution node and

975
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:03,200
it can process the specific

976
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,359
eye fit package

977
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,640
yeah this is the second one next page

978
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,960
piece

979
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,920
okay yeah this is all the

980
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,520
content defined english swaps and

981
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,480
any comments suggestion questions for

982
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,359
let's draft

983
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,480
uh please let us know and

984
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,240
we also request work group to evaluate

985
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,520
this draft and consider it

986
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:49,839
be adopted thank you that's all

987
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,240
okay or you will need to ask for

988
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,759
questions and manage the money

989
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,480
for sure uh any questions uh

990
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,200
folks for yali's presentation

991
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,839
jeff

992
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,280
jeff

993
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,720
am i off mute now yes thank you sorry

994
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,760
about that

995
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,559
ali thank you for presentation and this

996
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,359
i think is

997
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,400
a more general question uh more

998
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,000
applicable to your draft than the one

999
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,640
that giuseppe has presented

1000
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,720
um i have many concerns

1001
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,359
about the security considerations and

1002
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,599
some of the protocol behaviors for

1003
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,200
this draft not that the problem is not

1004
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,720
worth solving

1005
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,640
but i i think there's two things that

1006
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,400
are sort of clear from looking at the

1007
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,480
initial presentation

1008
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,400
the first one is that the ifit domains

1009
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,000
have considerations as to how widely

1010
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,559
this information can propagate

1011
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:11,760
and since these things are attached as

1012
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,920
extended communities you know they're

1013
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,040
very likely to get

1014
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,839
far away from where you want them to so

1015
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,440
some discussion about that needs to

1016
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,680
happen in the draft

1017
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,119
the second item i see is an immediate

1018
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,839
concern is when you're trying to

1019
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,520
actually say that the next hop

1020
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,559
is able to carry out certain behaviors

1021
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,400
you're making assumptions that the next

1022
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,520
hop is potentially not being reset on a

1023
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,960
different spot of the network than where

1024
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,200
the community was originally attached

1025
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,279
so i think that also raises concerns

1026
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,440
yeah thank you thank you your

1027
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,640
comments and suggestions and uh

1028
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,520
for your first question i think you mean

1029
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,480
the

1030
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,319
uh the i think uh uh domain

1031
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,680
right how widely the fatal man

1032
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,319
is and how widely the information can be

1033
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,079
transmitted and because i think

1034
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,280
the definition of life domain has been

1035
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,400
defined in i mean

1036
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,400
another drop and i think we can

1037
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,599
make it aids the jobs as a reference

1038
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,200
and make sure the domain

1039
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,800
of diabetes but uh as i know the

1040
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,760
ipad domain dependence and bounty dance

1041
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,079
the

1042
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,680
i face ingress node and the egress note

1043
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,040
so um after

1044
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,920
uh i mean when when the package had i

1045
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,640
fit

1046
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,160
uh i mean i fit a header

1047
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,599
in the package so before

1048
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,760
before the package transmitted to the

1049
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,280
e-grades nodes

1050
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,880
uh as shoe the header i think had

1051
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,599
should be removed from the package so

1052
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,480
let's

1053
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,800
try to make sure the uh the security

1054
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,040
uh in the trans uh i think domain i

1055
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,640
think

1056
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,240
but i think it should be a problem to

1057
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,520
to consider it it's a right the

1058
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,839
the specific concern is that the

1059
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,520
communities that you're attaching to bgp

1060
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,559
will leave the ifit domain so

1061
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,079
let us say that isp a

1062
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,119
is a ifit domain and it's part of you

1063
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,760
know autonomous system number one

1064
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,119
when the routes are sent for

1065
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,280
destinations inside of that autonomous

1066
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,480
system to autonomous system 2.

1067
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,559
if the ifit capabilities are not

1068
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,720
stripped

1069
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,480
i believe this gives information that

1070
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,720
suggests that as2

1071
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,880
is capable of doing ifit operations with

1072
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,240
as1

1073
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,079
i don't think the expectation for ifit

1074
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,240
is that that should work

1075
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,960
but the capability propagating tells it

1076
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,440
that

1077
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:14,240
maybe it should

1078
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,680
yeah uh i think yeah i i think i will

1079
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,040
uh considering your suggestion

1080
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,319
and uh if if you don't mind we we can

1081
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,359
discuss this

1082
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,920
in the main list yes i'll take it to the

1083
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,760
mailing list

1084
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,240
thank you very much thank you thank you

1085
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,680
boris you're next oh thank you

1086
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,400
yeah very short comment not question

1087
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,920
would be very good to see

1088
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:56,000
implementation status in the draft

1089
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,599
uh you mean worth the time

1090
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,559
it would be very good

1091
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,559
okay okay i i think i will add the

1092
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,559
part in a new version

1093
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,759
thank you for your comments

1094
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,640
tony hi a follow-up question to jeff's

1095
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,760
comment

1096
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,119
given that this is local and we really

1097
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,800
don't want it propagating

1098
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
wouldn't this be better served being in

1099
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,000
the management plane

1100
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,400
and not in bgp whatsoever

1101
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,880
oh i'm sorry i i i don't catch your

1102
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,920
opponent sorry

1103
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,119
so why is this information in bgp it

1104
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,319
seems like this is

1105
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,240
information that should be provided via

1106
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,200
open config

1107
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,720
oh okay this is from it's

1108
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,040
from the motivation i think from the

1109
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,839
motivation of

1110
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:05,760
this uh proposal we designed

1111
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,839
because we consider to

1112
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,920
take advantage of the btp protocol

1113
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,520
to dynamically trans uh dynamic

1114
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,520
dynamically detect the devices

1115
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,119
capability so we consider

1116
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,480
using the uh the control plan

1117
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,400
protocol not the management plan

1118
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,920
this is our uh motivation here

1119
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,359
because uh here we we i think a

1120
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,319
previous slide we have mentioned that we

1121
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:47,359
we're considering

1122
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,200
uh if we devices dynamically change

1123
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,559
this its uh capability uh

1124
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,920
to support the iphat uh application

1125
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,480
right

1126
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,280
so we need uh need have a matter to

1127
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,960
dynamically detect its capability

1128
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,559
so here we we give a uh

1129
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,839
a matter to taking advantage of the bdp

1130
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:14,880
protocol

1131
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,400
to to catch its

1132
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,760
capability information yeah this is our

1133
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,720
consideration

1134
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:26,720
here yes you are protocol i understand

1135
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,680
that

1136
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,760
why you stick it in routing this has

1137
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,880
nothing to do with routing

1138
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,720
okay you mean it relates relationship to

1139
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,520
the

1140
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,200
routing right so here i think

1141
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,319
um because the

1142
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:52,319
you mean uh you know that i feed uh

1143
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,440
the i fade application can be inserted

1144
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,319
into the

1145
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,520
package the the traffic packet so

1146
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,119
if we want to measure the

1147
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,680
performance matrix using the iphage

1148
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,960
i mean the iom or the alternate marking

1149
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,400
matter to

1150
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,240
to get the performance matrix so

1151
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,680
the devices need to support

1152
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,559
the capability to proce close process

1153
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,200
the iphage

1154
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,040
package so when we

1155
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,720
enter the ingress nodes when we decide

1156
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,200
uh which which

1157
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,559
for example which powers a path or the

1158
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:42,960
which

1159
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,280
flow uh we need to use the iphat

1160
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,559
application to measure the performance

1161
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,520
matrix

1162
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,960
we need to know

1163
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,119
these devices along the path can support

1164
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:03,200
this capability i mean the supposed the

1165
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,000
eye fit

1166
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,599
capability so you can affect

1167
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,680
the uh affect application

1168
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,520
on the other hand if you

1169
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,200
want to calculate a path

1170
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,799
can be used the ifit

1171
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,839
application to to

1172
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,720
measure the performance matrix to make

1173
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,920
sure the

1174
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,119
soa of list parts so

1175
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,400
you need to know uh how

1176
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,680
which devices cannot support

1177
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:44,160
or which device can support the iphat

1178
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,440
application along the path

1179
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,480
so um kelly

1180
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,079
this is sue um i think

1181
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,200
you might i i think you might

1182
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,240
need before working group adoption

1183
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,480
to uh carefully consider tony's

1184
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,000
question and uh

1185
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,040
provide some pros and cons

1186
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,040
uh on this i don't think

1187
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,079
at this point perhaps due to the fact

1188
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,799
you've just heard tony's question that

1189
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:22,079
you've given

1190
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,280
a uh response

1191
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,119
that doesn't point back to the

1192
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,400
management plane

1193
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,119
so i may i kindly suggest that

1194
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,079
you consider this question with your

1195
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,520
co-authors

1196
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,520
and provide

1197
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,640
some additional details if you'd like

1198
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,640
some feedback on an initial

1199
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,880
presentation before you send it to the

1200
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,960
list you are welcome to send it to the

1201
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,839
chairs

1202
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:55,599
but i think it would be wise to consider

1203
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:58,079
and give pros and cons before you go for

1204
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,000
a working group adoption otherwise

1205
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,400
i think we're going to go through this

1206
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,839
discussion again

1207
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:07,520
would that be okay ellie yeah sure

1208
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,640
i want to discuss more details with that

1209
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,319
with yours

1210
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,040
yeah or you can i encourage you that

1211
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,640
this discussion should be

1212
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,839
come to uh should occur will need to

1213
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,920
occur on the list before working group

1214
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,280
adoption

1215
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,200
but if you are unclear on the question

1216
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,280
or the import of the question you can of

1217
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,599
course send the chairs

1218
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,280
some some clarification

1219
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,559
but you will need to discuss why this

1220
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,680
is important to put in routing

1221
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,559
on the list before we go working a group

1222
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,200
adoption

1223
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,319
otherwise i'm afraid it will just repeat

1224
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,200
during working group adoption

1225
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,440
