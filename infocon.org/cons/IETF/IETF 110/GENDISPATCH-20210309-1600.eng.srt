the process or even if you're not new to

49
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,919
the process

50
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,120
you should read over the bcps

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,440
which define the processes and policies

52
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,960
of the ietf

53
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
and if you are participating in this

54
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
working group

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
that means that you are agreeing to

56
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
follow those policies

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,800
please make yourself aware of them there

58
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,639
are lots of them with regard to

59
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,479
how we behave in working groups and

60
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,320
there are lots of them with regard to

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,960
how intellectual property plays in

62
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,919
please

63
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
review

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,440
so um if you don't mind please have your

65
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,080
video

66
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,199
off unless you're uh presenting or

67
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,320
speaking

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,440
um and definitely mute your microphone

69
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
unless you're speaking uh that will help

70
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
both folks who are

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,320
listening and keep your bandwidth pretty

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,199
low

73
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,919
um if you can use a headset please do

74
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,639
that will stop echoes from happening

75
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
the blue sheet is automatically

76
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,199
generated from the list of folks

77
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,360
so there's no need to write your name

78
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
down anywhere we'll

79
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,000
check that with the meat echo things and

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,039
uh the chat that is

81
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,680
taking place over in the chat room on

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
meat echo

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,560
is also taking place on jabber you can

84
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,320
connect to both and get to the same

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,280
place

86
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,360
and there are some urls which you can

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,800
find to

88
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,919
get information on that

89
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,199
uh if you would download from the

90
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
agenda page you'll find

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
most of these links you'll find this

92
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,840
presentation it will have all of these

93
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,880
links

94
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
and so if you need to get to any of

95
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
these places those are all the nice urls

96
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,919
and we'll talk about the incoming and

97
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,120
outgoing chairs

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
in a moment but those are links to email

99
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,039
addresses as well

100
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,120
so remember that gen dispatch does not

101
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,080
um adopt drafts itself unlike other

102
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
dispatch working groups

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,840
we only recommend net steps for new work

104
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
which means we're either going to

105
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,360
recommend directing

106
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
work to an existing working group

107
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,680
proposing a new focused working group

108
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,120
proposing that an ad sponsor document if

109
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,840
that

110
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,039
ad is willing ask for

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,639
additional discussion or community

112
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
development if that's required before

113
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,240
making a recommendation

114
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
or saying outright that we don't think

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,080
the ietf should work on a particular

116
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
topic

117
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,000
please do keep these outcomes in mind as

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,599
we have discussion

119
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,199
we're looking for answers to the

120
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
question of what do we do with these

121
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,400
proposals

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,039
uh not necessarily arguing about the

123
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,120
contents of the proposals themselves

124
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
those cannot always change after we

125
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,479
decide

126
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,840
how to dispatch something

127
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
so uh we will see your name if we're

128
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
participating in

129
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
meet echo but for those folks who are

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
only doing audio please do state your

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,759
name before

132
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,800
you begin speaking um again

133
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,039
keep the dispatch question in mind that

134
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
is the key so if you're making a comment

135
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
always useful to end that comment with

136
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,479
and therefore

137
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
i think we should do x with the working

138
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,680
group or do

139
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
why with the document or whatever it is

140
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,000
um please try and keep your comments

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
limited so that everybody gets a chance

142
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
to speak um

143
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
the buttons there if you want to join

144
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
the queue just push the little hand

145
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,440
button which is below your name on the

146
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
left side of the screen

147
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
when you are given the floor by the

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,400
chair

149
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,840
please unmute your audio and

150
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,319
unmute your video if you want to show

151
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,000
your smiling face

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,520
so that you can send that we don't

153
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,639
control turning the video on and off

154
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
um so please do so at your leisure

155
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
um and then the other controls that

156
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
little um

157
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,360
uh chatty button is the jabber if we say

158
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,039
that we're going to do a show of hands

159
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,199
up on that top row of buttons the one

160
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,199
that looks like a little bar graph

161
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,919
is the show of hands tool and so we'll

162
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,880
ask you to go there

163
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
next so uh let's do a little agenda

164
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,360

173
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,040
and keith moore are going to do a

174
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,560
presentation on

175
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
uh general more general than we've been

176
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
talking about uh previously

177
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
diversity inclusiveness in the ietf and

178
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
then we've got

179
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,760
plenty of time to either extend those

180
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,600
discussions if they get long

181
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,000
or to do any other business and then

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
we'll do a quick conclusion do

183
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,760
does anybody have any bashes to the

184
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
agenda

185
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,800
things they want added etc

186
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,080
listening listening john corrects me to

187
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,640
say that

188
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
his is not a presentation but a rant

189
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,000
that's okay

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
um okay so this is our agenda

191
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,360
we will go forward as such

192
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
um is that the end of our

193
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
first round of slides is it time for

194
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,640
john

195
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,240
and francesca is clicking around good

196
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,279
sign

197
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,180
slides up

198
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,250
[Music]

199
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,560
all right you're up to bat john i'll

200
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,360
meet myself

201
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
okay in in the process of working on

202
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,720
something else i

203
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,000
think the rfc editor issues

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
um i had occasion to look at

205
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,959
uh at rfc 2028 for the first time

206
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,839
next slide please

207
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,519
in uh in many years not quite

208
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,560
since october 96 but close

209
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,760
this is a 20 it's a quarter century old

210
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,959
document

211
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,160
uh which has substantively

212
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
except for intellectual property rights

213
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,560
issues been uh

214
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,920
unchanged in the last quarter century uh

215
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,760
except for the iatf llc terminology

216
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,480
uh and uh unsurprisingly many things

217
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,600
have changed

218
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
in in those last 25 years um

219
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,760
so the question i would oppose today is

220
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
a little bit different from the

221
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,279
uh usual one for gen dispatch and the

222
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,120
pete summarized earlier

223
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
uh there is no draft to replace this at

224
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
the moment

225
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,519
uh i'm uh i'm looking for a sense as to

226
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,000
whether

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,399
there's uh there's any way to move

228
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,000
forward on this whether

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
people care uh and uh

230
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,000
and if uh if the answer to both those

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
questions

232
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,399
is yes then uh then it's responsibility

233
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
of either this group

234
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
or the ad to uh to solicit volunteers

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,160
and uh and figure out how to move

236
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,519
forward uh

237
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
next slide

238
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,279
uh so uh as i said in the process of

239
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,720
looking at this

240
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,560
i found a uh a number of interesting

241
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,880
problems the document contains

242
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,839
normative pointers to things which the

243
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
authors believed were being worked on at

244
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
the time

245
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,519
they may have been correct but those

246
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,200
documents have never been completed and

247
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,560
published

248
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,200
um the document is a particularly

249
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
interesting comment

250
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,120
still believes the ietf chair is

251
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,959
appointed by the iab

252
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,480
which would make this working group uh

253
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,839
a rather interesting situation uh and

254
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
there may be some

255
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,959
uh iedf llc loose ends

256
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
um uh including things which

257
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,839
point to this document uh and then point

258
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,880
elsewhere

259
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,959
for details that aren't there that's

260
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,639
also true of a number of other places in

261
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,680
this document

262
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,880
where it's pointing to things for

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,120
details which are not there

264
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,360
along with documents along with pointing

265
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,959
as i mentioned earlier documentaries

266
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,399
don't exist

267
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,800
um it claims the secretariat not the llc

268
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,920
is responsible for uh maintain the

269
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,399
formal

270
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,600
public record of uh of what's going on

271
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
um that

272
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,519
that may be true in practice but whether

273
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,160
given the llc's organization that's true

274
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,480
in

275
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,760
uh in theory is an open question

276
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,399
and again those are just examples the

277
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,120
document

278
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,680
is relative to actual contemporary

279
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,560
practice

280
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
contemporary organizations and how

281
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,560
things fit together

282
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,399
uh in uh in relatively bad shape

283
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,240
uh so uh next slide i think there is no

284
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,959
next slide

285
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,000
ah yes uh

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,800
uh the document predates as i say it's

287
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,600
old

288
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,519
so it predates the current chart of the

289
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,839
internet architecture board

290
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,360
uh the current charter of the isg uh

291
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,040
and uh and all the changes the rfc

292
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,639
editor function

293
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,760
and its relationship the iatf

294
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,320
uh to say nothing of those changes which

295
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,040
are

296
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,639
further changes which are now under

297
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,519
discussion um

298
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,279
so as i say document which is not a good

299
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,079
shape

300
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,560
document which he we have told other

301
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,600
organizations

302
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,079
to refer to and trying to understand the

303
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,480
iatf what's going on in the ietf

304
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,839
uh we're probably still telling

305
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,320
newcomers that uh and

306
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,920
and it just doesn't reflect contemporary

307
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
reality uh next slide if i'm not

308
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,480
finished

309
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
ah uh so possibilities

310
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,920
uh one possibility is we've been

311
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,440
successfully ignoring this problem for

312
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
at least two decades

313
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,320
and we could continue to do that uh

314
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,399
second possibility is make it historic

315
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
erected tombstone

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,800
and tell those who look for it either

317
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
where to go instead

318
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
or they're on their own those two

319
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,000
options might be equivalent

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
um and uh the third possibility

321
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,680
obviously

322
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
is to revise and replace the thing

323
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,199
that's not probably not a small

324
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,720
rewriting task

325
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
because some of the things one might

326
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,399
replace it with our

327
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,279
are probably controversial and uh and

328
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,639
there may not be agreement of what to

329
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,680
say

330
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,399
uh next

331
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,800
ah that's where i run out so i didn't

332
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
need 20 minutes

333
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,759
um back to you co-chairs and open for

334
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,440
discussion

335
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,120
okay so well let's open the floor

336
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,240
and you know and again please

337
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,519
um we're overtly looking to dispatch

338
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,480
this thing so

339
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,399
let's talk in those terms

340
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,639
thoughts anybody

341
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,480
andrew go right ahead

342
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
uh well firstly thank you john for

343
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
succinctly setting out the problem

344
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
uh which has really helped what

345
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,920
impressed how quickly he managed to do

346
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,480
that

347
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,079
um well on your three

348
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,320
uh so substantive options um

349
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,839
i i guess i'm struggling to see

350
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,560
any viable option other than revise and

351
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,240
replace the thing

352
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,399
because it would seem to me to be more

353
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,240
for a standards body

354
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,560
to to have set some standards of how it

355
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,360
behaves

356
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,639
the the just plain wrong um i would have

357
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,920
thought that undermines the whole

358
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,959
premise

359
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,040
of everything else the itf does dare i

360
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
say it if it can't even get its

361
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
procedures right

362
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,800
um not without and that's not

363
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,759
trivializing

364
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,160
the task um because it clearly would

365
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,440
need people with a lot

366
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,720
of detailed historic knowledge of lots

367
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,320
of things in order to actually do it but

368
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
i think

369
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
in my view it's something which now

370
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,079
you've identified it and drawn attention

371
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,560
to it

372
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
um it needs to be done so that's my view

373
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,199
thank you

374
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,839
i i didn't volunteer among your comments

375
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,559
um steven i believe you're up next

376
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,640
yeah i put this in general i'm not clear

377
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
of the downside of continuing to to

378
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,880
ignore

379
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,400
this uh i agree that you know from a

380
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
purist point of view fixing it will be

381
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
fine

382
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
i i think it might be counterproductive

383
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
though so what's the downside

384
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,120
of continuing to ignore the problem

385
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,559
i see the downside as as closely

386
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,480
connected to what andrew just said

387
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
we're pointing other people this

388
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,919
document we've got other documents which

389
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,280
point to it

390
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,559
uh we're uh we've told other standards

391
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,200
bodies in the past that when they are

392
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,799
trying to sort out the iab iasg

393
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,919
ietf and isaac relationships

394
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,160
that this is where they should go look

395
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,480
uh so there's a a little bit of a

396
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,000
credibility problem

397
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,679
there's a little bit of an introduction

398
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,600
to newcomers problem

399
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,080
uh and uh uh and and like andrew i

400
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,039
i don't consider those first two options

401
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,919
viable

402
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,440
but uh but as i think i told uh

403
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,520
at least francisco a few days ago

404
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
uh i'm i'm more than happy to try to

405
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,039
work with someone or advise someone on

406
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,120
on writing and editing this but i don't

407
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,840
have time to do it myself

408
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,640
since you mentioned it john do you want

409
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,400
to talk about the downside of making it

410
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,520
historic and

411
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,600
and say we're just not talking about

412
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,840
this

413
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,840
um

414
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,960
i think it makes us look silly

415
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
um uh maybe we don't care

416
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,799
and in particular maybe we don't care

417
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,360
that anybody to whom we look silly

418
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,559
comes to that conclusion but uh

419
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,080
but it strikes me as um

420
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,720
as a little as as a little disorderly

421
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
and unprofessional

422
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,039
uh but again my uh since i'm not going

423
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,240
to volunteer

424
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
my opinion doesn't count very much and

425
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,840
it's a matter of uh

426
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,960
of community consensus and uh and

427
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,840
whether or not they're

428
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,840
whether or not anybody's going to do the

429
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,640
work

430
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,559
uh rich europe

431
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,240
um yeah the other day

432
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
john touched on a couple of the

433
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,240
downsides i think um

434
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,840
having you know the dow the itf

435
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,559
which is way too long but for newcomers

436
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,240
to look at but there are people

437
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
having run a bunch of the newcomer

438
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,919
sessions over the past few years

439
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,799
it'd be really nice to have a short

440
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,480
document that says this is how we are

441
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,679
structured

442
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,760
um for newcomers uh for people who

443
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
and newcomers come from various places

444
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
they come as engineers who want to work

445
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
on things

446
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,880
they come as industry consortia

447
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
who want to reach out and talk to us

448
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,559
such as

449
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,320
pick one recent one the inclusive naming

450
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,919
initiative

451
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,200
they come to us as you know full-fledged

452
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,880
heavyweight international standards

453
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,400
organizations who want to get

454
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,559
liaisons and we don't have a single

455
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,720
clear document that says here's how

456
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,080
it goes um and it's kind of embarrassing

457
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,440
to say oh yeah this is

458
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,000
this it is what it is ask around which

459
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,520
is really what the only alternative is

460
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,760
now

461
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,799
does does that mean that either rich or

462
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,600
andrew are

463
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,240
volunteering i i guess is always the

464
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,200
question

465
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,799
i volunteer andrew no

466
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,200
i i will certainly yeah i i'll

467
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
put my hand up because it's got to be

468
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,360
done

469
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,559
all right um bro go ahead

470
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,080
popping on exactly the same bandwagon

471
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
here that it not only is it really

472
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,240
unprofessional it is really unwelcoming

473
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,200
to anyone new coming along to to see an

474
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,520
organization that can't even

475
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,840
that doesn't even know how it works in a

476
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,880
defined way

477
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
i mean yes everybody knows but the

478
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,120
everybody knows and the only way to find

479
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,960
out is to ask a bunch of people

480
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,880
and and build tribal knowledge build um

481
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
cargo cult your understanding of how it

482
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,559
goes all these terms

483
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,520
um it's that's not the way that any

484
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
serious organization

485
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,760
has its org chart you know that is one

486
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,200
of the most basic things that you do

487
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,559
right at the start is you say this is

488
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
how we are structured this is how we

489
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,960
work

490
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,039
and to be working for a 25 year old

491
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,640
document that's not correct and have

492
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,559
that real normative definition of who we

493
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,679
are

494
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,960
is is pretty bogus um having said that

495
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
i'm not volunteering to write it because

496
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,600
i haven't been around long enough

497
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,799
i'm still working on tribal knowledge so

498
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,039
your recommendation for dispatch is

499
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,559
is uh dispatch the iasg and say

500
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,480
fix this you're you're running this

501
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,120
organization

502
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,840
all right uh keith you're up

503
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
um so i think i would say that

504
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,919
to me i've been looking at this you know

505
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,600
inclusiveness problem and this seems

506
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,799
like a big part of it

507
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,039
that the organization organization

508
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,360
structure is rather opaque

509
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
and not only to newcomers i've been

510
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,640
around over 30 years

511
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,760
and i can't hardly keep track of who's

512
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,919
doing what anymore or where to go

513
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,440
when i have a certain issue having said

514
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,320
that so i think

515
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
i think this information needs to be

516
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,080
updated in some form i'm not sure that

517
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,559
an rfc is the best way to do it

518
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,240
because rfcs are there's so many of them

519
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,679
out there and we don't remember which

520
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,240
rfcs do what anymore uh

521
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,000
it's almost a way of hiding the

522
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
information so i think

523
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,120
rfcs are good places to put details so

524
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,799
that if you have a lot of details that

525
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,919
need to be specified

526
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,919
you know and someone wants to go read

527
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,200
the fine print sure

528
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,480
point them to an rfc that's fine but uh

529
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,799
probably the sort of primary

530
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,159
presentation of this

531
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,720
should be something attached to the

532
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,520
website

533
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,880
and that whole website i think needs a

534
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
whole bunch of thought because i think

535
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,720
the tools are great but the website is

536
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,200
pretty uh opaque itself

537
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,559
so um there's some there's some need to

538
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,200
sort of

539
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,120
come up with a fresh approach of saying

540
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,880
how do we explain ietf to our

541
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,039
participants and as well as to people

542
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,400
who are

543
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,440
external and make that information very

544
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,400
clear and accessible

545
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,159
okay jeffrey

546
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,159
i think for this document to be useful

547
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,679
it would have to be a living document

548
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,159
that

549
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,240
that kind of is the way that you change

550
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,360
the organization

551
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,840
rather than is a documentation of

552
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,679
changes that have already been made

553
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,480
um looking at it it has been updated by

554
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
kind of references to other rfcs rather

555
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,200
than by

556
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,240
being a single place you can look to to

557
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,039
learn everything

558
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,000
which is not which makes it not useful

559
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,400
um

560
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,240
so i would suggest making it historic

561
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,919
and saying that that the website needs

562
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,600
to be the way to document

563
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,440
kind of the structure of the

564
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,000
organization

565
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,840
all right um elliott

566
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,600
elliot thanks pete um i agree with

567
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,159
jeffrey

568
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,000
uh by and large if i look at the

569
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,960
information that's in this document

570
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,679
we have a we have other documents that

571
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,640
cover

572
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,039
that information far better at this

573
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,320
point some of it

574
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,400
is in fact in the tao of the ietf

575
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,679
uh some of it is in other rfcs and some

576
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,000
of it's on the website and other places

577
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
i think probably somebody just need if

578
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,279
somebody wants to they would just go and

579
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,799
maybe work with somebody like greg wood

580
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,799
to really identify the right places for

581
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
this information

582
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,159
you know on the website and then we

583
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,000
could leave a tombstone after that would

584
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,039
be my suggestion

585
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,080
thank you

586
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,559
thanks elliot uh dkg europe hi there

587
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,760
uh dinocon gilmore so um

588
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,159
i think this com this conversation is a

589
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,760
difficult one to have because people are

590
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
hearing it as two different things

591
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
i think people are hearing this as the

592
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,080
itf needs to be reorganized

593
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,600
and they're also hearing it as we need a

594
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,120
better documentation of what the current

595
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
situation of the ietf

596
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
is if we're talking about getting rid of

597
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,760
this document because someone wants to

598
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,120
write a better description of how the

599
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,799
ietf works

600
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,880
then that's one project but if we're

601
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
talking about revising this document in

602
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,360
the sense of

603
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,840
we let's let's normalize and regularize

604
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,200
our organizational chart

605
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
that is an entirely different project

606
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,720
and so i think we need to be really

607
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,279
clear

608
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,320
if we're asking for a better

609
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,000
documentation of what is going on in the

610
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,440
ietf

611
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,679
that is the living document project that

612
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,279
i think other folks are saying doesn't

613
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
fit well with the static nature of the

614
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,080
rfc

615
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
and then the tombstone is totally

616
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,000
adequate to just say you know we realize

617
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,919
that our organization doesn't work in

618
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,640
this in this static way and you can find

619
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,760
better documentation

620
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,159
in the following places and i think a

621
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
tombstone would be sufficient

622
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,960
for for what it's worth i hadn't heard

623
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,480
i mean other than in the chatroom people

624
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,600
questioning it the suggestion that

625
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,400
whatever comes next is somehow going to

626
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
regularize or do new stuff

627
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
but more by way of documenting existing

628
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
practice

629
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,080
uh i think that these things are pretty

630
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,360
tightly entangled

631
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,960
right i mean when you start asking

632
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,000
questions about who is really

633
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,600
responsible for a thing

634
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,360
um whoever writes that document is going

635
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,960
to find themselves coming up against the

636
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,840
well

637
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,520
this person is nominally supposed to do

638
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,120
it but in practice you actually bring it

639
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,000
over to this group

640
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,240
and they know how to like turn the

641
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,440
machinery correctly

642
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,960
so i think it's going to be really i

643
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
think they're going to be

644
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,919
more closely entangled than we'd like

645
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,039
them to be and that's why people are

646
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,600
responding fair enough

647
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,039
i i hear that thank you that that helped

648
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,559
um colin you're up to bat

649
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,919
so uh

650
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,840
uh-oh my audio is working or is it

651
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,960
working yeah your audio is working there

652
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,159
was a little echo there for a second but

653
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,360
it sounds okay now

654
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,440
i just got a message mid checkout that

655
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
wasn't working so i

656
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
like i agree with a lot of what dkg is

657
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,000
saying there and this is

658
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,520
largely i view this more like a

659
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,120
constitutional sort of

660
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
fine detailed document that nails down

661
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,880
the exact details of our process and yes

662
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
it's totally embarrassing that it's

663
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,799
wrong

664
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,640
but this is not we could should not try

665
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,080
and revise this to be the thing that

666
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
helps newcomers or other organizations

667
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,320
figure out how work actually happens

668
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,840
like we need stuff that does that but it

669
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,080
doesn't need to be a document like this

670
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
in the slightest so i i think those are

671
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,760
two very completely separate problems

672
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,720
um but on this document and updating it

673
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,279
uh

674
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,440
i mean yeah it's embarrassing how wrong

675
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,320
it is but

676
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,520
i it seems colossally difficult to

677
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,440
get agreement on all the stuff that

678
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,279
updates it so i'm i'm a little bit on

679
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,080
the

680
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,919
the version of um you know you can troll

681
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,679
through the updates for other documents

682
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,799
that that have

683
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,799
updated this one obsolete and whatever

684
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,840
uh

685
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,399
and figure out what's going on i'm i'm

686
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,919
not totally sure we

687
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,200
you know unless somebody has a huge

688
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
amount of energy to put into

689
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,240
dealing with that the use case of fixing

690
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,120
the sort of

691
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
constitution of this stuff not fixing

692
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,159
the educational

693
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,120
documentation of what people use um this

694
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,720
sounds like it's just going to be a huge

695
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
quagmire so i

696
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,279
i would want us to be really clear on

697
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,799
what the scope of change is where we're

698
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
making before we open this up

699
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,760
or what we're going to do and i'll

700
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
remind people that dispatch one of the

701
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,520
ways to dispatch an idea was always to

702
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,960
stuff a sword through it right that's

703
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,000
one of the meanings

704
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,360
yes well and in this particular case

705
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,919
i believe john's choice number one is

706
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,840
the equivalent of

707
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,200
no we're not going to do anything about

708
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,480
this so um

709
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
thanks uh colin

710
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,480
hey uh i should know better not to join

711
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,159
the queue immediately after cullen

712
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,520
because i'm always confused about who

713
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,240
you're

714
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,000
calling on um i mean i

715
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,480
you know i i i sort of read this

716
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,600
document and

717
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,080
i have to admit that i first started

718
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,840
coming to the itf about a month after

719
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,039
this was

720
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,039
published and i haven't read it in the

721
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,480
in intervening time

722
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,679
uh and to be honest from reading it it

723
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,440
doesn't say anything which isn't already

724
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,200
on the website

725
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
uh and you know making sure we have

726
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,720
crisp definitions of

727
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,279
you know the charters of the the iab and

728
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,360
the iasg and the irtf and all these

729
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,120
other organizations

730
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,760
i think is important this particular

731
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,600
document just seems to be describing

732
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,799
stuff which is

733
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,760
um you know we already described it well

734
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,279
enough on the website just you know

735
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:37,919
label it as

736
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,200
as historic and move on

737
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,840
you did you put yourself in the queue

738
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,480
john

739
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,399
mr clinton yeah yeah

740
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,039
um i want to slightly push back at some

741
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,240
of the comments that you've been

742
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,880
made recently uh including in jabber

743
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,080
um newcomers do look at this

744
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,039
because the website turns out to be very

745
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,880
pretty but impenetrable

746
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,640
and maybe maybe we should fix that um

747
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,000
other standards bodies look at this uh

748
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
uh either because we've pointed them to

749
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,919
it or because they want one thing to

750
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:22,640
look at

751
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,200
or because the website is uh

752
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,519
impenetrable and the towel is too long

753
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,519
to pay attention to um

754
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,120
uh and with regard to living documents i

755
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,080
understand the argument uh i appreciate

756
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,440
the argument

757
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
but if our organizational structure at

758
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,039
the level that this document

759
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,279
is talking about or ought to be talking

760
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,240
about

761
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,120
is evolving in real time then we have

762
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
another set of problems

763
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,799
and again if uh if one of the concerns

764
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,360
we have again referring to some of the

765
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,960
comments in the chat

766
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,880
is that other standards body look at

767
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,799
this

768
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,679
and other things and want to prove that

769
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,279
we're just a bunch of amateurs and

770
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,559
children who should be

771
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,679
to whom no attention should be paid then

772
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,799
then the state of this and saying uh

773
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,880
go read the tower go read these six

774
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,919
things

775
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,320
is not helpful uh and uh

776
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,080
um so i think there's really a

777
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,480
strong argument for a document like this

778
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,080
there's a strong argument for a document

779
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,840
like this

780
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,760
being more than stable enough to keep in

781
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
the rfc series

782
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,840
even though that doesn't necessarily

783
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,679
mean it should be in the rfc

784
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,360
series so let's try to

785
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,480
calibrate this relative to newcomers

786
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,559
external impressions

787
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,320
uh people trying to learn what's going

788
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,760
on

789
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,440
uh one could get rid of it

790
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,480
and replace it by crisp reference as to

791
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,600
where to look

792
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
but again that's not really a

793
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
satisfactory solution

794
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,399
although it might be a good intermediate

795
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,960
stage uh thanks

796
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,200
thank you um ecker

797
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,760
yeah i mean so it seems to me like

798
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,399
you know the having for this document

799
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,519
like if the task at hand is

800
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,600
this is their two tasks at hand one is

801
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,640
to provide like

802
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,799
what do you need to be a newcomer and

803
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,640
like be successful at itf

804
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,279
and like a document shape like this is

805
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,279
like whether it's in rc

806
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,960
or whatever it's like fantastically not

807
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,880
helpful for that because

808
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,039
like there's like what you need is a

809
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,200
certain kind of task orientation that

810
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,799
this does not bring to the party

811
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,799
um if you're looking for a description

812
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,120
of like the idf's overall thing

813
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,760
um overall structure well i i guess i'm

814
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,960
not sure what that's used for

815
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,880
but um but that's not that probably the

816
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,080
newcomers really need

817
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,519
um and um while i agree our organization

818
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,559
um um as sort of colin pointed out um

819
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,039
you know

820
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,560
there's this question of like the sort

821
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,000
of constitutional stuff and like

822
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,199
documenting things

823
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,760
um in in very in the in a precise format

824
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,879
and there's a question of like what you

825
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,000
need to know when you're first like

826
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,879
trying to get into it

827
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,159
and i think i made the example on the

828
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,079
chat like um you know

829
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,560
if you want to like understand tls um

830
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,119
you know

831
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,879
you wouldn't go to a46 you'd like want

832
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,399
to have a document described like how

833
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,599
sales worth the high level and then you

834
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,440
dig 84 46 for the details

835
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,000
um so you know uh while i understand

836
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,119
that our um

837
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,040
our process is going to be changing that

838
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,199
rapidly um

839
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,719
um the uh um and so one might imagine

840
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,199
like

841
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,639
that whatever document you produce to

842
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,320
explain them um you know

843
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,839
does not need to like change also i

844
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,760
don't that's correct um because you know

845
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,800
as we iterate through

846
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
like people coming in and people trying

847
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,918
to understand what's going on um

848
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,119
you know it will be helpful to be able

849
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,719
to revise the documents easily in order

850
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,599
to make them clearer

851
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,119
as we understand people find confusing

852
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,880
people not and the sort of like rfc

853
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,000
formula is not particularly well suited

854
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
for that so while the while structures

855
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,160
may be stable

856
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,440
the documentation in this case for

857
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,839
newcomers not to be stable unnecessarily

858
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,040
and like this is like what the web is

859
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,960
good for so um like

860
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,280
so to close that relatively one comment

861
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,720
um i'm on team

862
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,839
tune's done this and right input on the

863
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
website

864
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,279
okay uh keith you're back in the queue

865
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,359
a little bit has been mentioned about

866
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,000
this in the chat room but i think that

867
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,200
separate from any efforts to

868
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,640
document the structure of ietf

869
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,359
we have gotten to be very complex and

870
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,240
bureaucratic

871
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,599
and i wonder if that really serves us

872
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,000
and that's an even bigger thing to

873
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,160
contemplate than documenting what's

874
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,359
there

875
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,240
but i do think it serves as a barrier to

876
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,760
participation

877
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,040
and uh i feel like we we're dealing with

878
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,000
a structure that we

879
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,359
developed in the late 1990s

880
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,440
and have have since embellished since

881
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,720
then

882
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,960
that for an organization which was

883
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,119
actually much larger at the time

884
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,920
and i'm not sure that it serves us well

885
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,960
for the current

886
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,000
somewhat leaner organization or

887
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,880
uh for the organization we have and the

888
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,640
current needs we have so i guess i would

889
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,480
like to see

890
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,200
some effort in looking at you know do we

891
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,599
need

892
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,680
all these separate organizations can we

893
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,440
streamline this a bit

894
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,000
uh but it needs to be done very

895
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,359
patiently of course

896
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,319
so anyway

897
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,320
thanks um colin you're back in the queue

898
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,920
no colin didn't want to be in the queue

899
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,560
harold please go ahead

900
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,720
so that document has no

901
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,200
real problems it documents perfectly

902
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
well or

903
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
perfectly well what we wanted to say

904
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,000
about the situation 25 years ago

905
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,440
the point is to the documentary problem

906
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,960
because the pointers imply

907
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,480
that the state of art that we tried to

908
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,440
tell other people

909
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,960
25 years ago is the current state

910
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,680
so i think we should make it historic

911
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,400
because this i think we should uh

912
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,560
go hand for pointers to it and destroy

913
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,119
them point them to the tower

914
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,880
i mean if we have a towel that is

915
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
unreadable then we have

916
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,720
within the tower we have a tower problem

917
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,800
so middle alternative for me

918
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,079
dispatch it to go is go historic

919
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,839
and and get those pointers fixed

920
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,720
i'm a simple man

921
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,240
never has anybody claimed that um

922
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,599
andrew you're a backup thanks

923
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,359
um well so reading some of the comments

924
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:07,839
in the

925
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,760
uh chat um if i was being unkind i'd

926
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
characterize them as saying

927
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,520
john's pointed out that we're running a

928
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,160
restaurant with with dirty cutlery

929
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,839
um and a few people are suggesting we

930
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,599
should just ignore the problem

931
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,079
um i think having dirty cutler is not

932
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,359
not a good

933
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,119
a good look for a restaurant and that

934
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,560
needs to be fixed

935
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,880
so you can either make it historic which

936
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,720
i think personally

937
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,800
well or revise it but ignoring it

938
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,280
seems um unhelpful may get closed down

939
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,839
when the

940
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,560
food inspectors come round so i think

941
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,480
that's asking for trouble

942
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,440
um not changing it because the website

943
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,480
the tao and

944
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
assorted other documents that people

945
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
might think are very equally

946
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,359
um wrong out of date impenetrable um and

947
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,280
nobody uses them anyway it also seems

948
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,200
like a really bad argument

949
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,240
uh to me um yeah that just talks the

950
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,359
fact that there's a whole bunch of

951
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,720
things that need to be fixed

952
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,240
but you've got to start somewhere um and

953
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,800
finally i'm sorry just laughing at

954
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,240
elliot's comment in the chat

955
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,280
finally dare i say this this does link

956
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,720
with the next topic uh on the agenda

957
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,920
uh because diversity doesn't improve

958
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
if you've got enormous barriers to entry

959
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,480
to an organization i think this is just

960
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,680
one of those

961
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,800
barriers to entry so putting up with

962
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,200
barriers to entry is a bad approach as

963
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,160
well

964
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,720
so in my view something has to be done

965
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,640
ignoring it is not the answer

966
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,880
thank you

967
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,520
um okay uh wes you're the last one in

968
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,920
the queue

969
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,800
yeah so um interesting problem thanks

970
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,760
for finding it

971
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,200
um my my view is

972
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,880
probably slightly different i'm not sure

973
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,640
that historic is right because

974
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,400
i don't generally think that we should

975
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
remove important information although

976
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,079
the historical still exists so maybe

977
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,000
that's you know not actually the case

978
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,160
i actually think we ought to update it

979
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,280
not to

980
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,880
make any changes no modifications

981
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
whatsoever just

982
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,720
only clarifications to what the existing

983
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,480
state is right what are the things that

984
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,359
are wrong

985
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,079
document that reword it throw out

986
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:20,640
anything

987
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,560
that you know is no longer relevant and

988
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,760
throw out anything

989
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,880
or mark as no consensus where

990
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
we have disagreement about what the

991
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,760
current state is i think one of the rat

992
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,200
holes will be

993
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,440
you know one person says this and the

994
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,200
other person says this about

995
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,440
i don't know how the iab works or you

996
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,560
know pick any random

997
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,000
one of the organizations during that

998
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
document and uh just documented us no

999
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,079
consensus at this time

1000
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,599
with respect to a living document i

1001
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,599
don't think that the state of

1002
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,119
the the leadership bodies and all of the

1003
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,040
organizations you know change super

1004
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:53,920
quickly

1005
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,319
we should make rfcs easier to update i

1006
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:57,520
you know i think everybody probably

1007
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,720
agrees on that i don't know that it

1008
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,920
needs to go to the state of a living

1009
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
document but i would argue that

1010
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,800
a rewrite as long as you promise not to

1011
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,480
make modifications and structural

1012
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,119
changes

1013
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,560
you know shouldn't be as hard as

1014
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,880
everybody is saying if we agree to do

1015
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,200
that

1016
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,420
that's the tricky part

1017
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,040
[Music]

1018
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,560
all right um and alexi jumped in at the

1019
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,160
last moment alexi

1020
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,280
yeah i think i pretty much want to uh

1021
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,240
second what

1022
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,839
was uh just said um

1023
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,800
maybe it's a wishful uh thinking of

1024
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,119
hearing but uh

1025
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,359
i think um maybe we should decide that

1026
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,640
we want to do something

1027
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,480
and then we can figure out whether it's

1028
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,400
a web page on the website

1029
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,200
maybe post a draft and then see if you

1030
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,800
want to progress to rfc

1031
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,319
to replace it or whether it just becomes

1032
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,520
a

1033
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,839
web page on the website and when people

1034
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,160
uh talk about tom stone i'm

1035
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,640
again i'm not entirely sure is this a

1036
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,440
short rfc

1037
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,839
saying that the original rfc is obsolete

1038
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,440
and here's where you want to find the

1039
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,480
information and

1040
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,079
again it's one of

1041
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,359
possible outcomes for this

1042
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,839
all right um

1043
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,680
heaven help me i i might actually want

1044
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,520
to use the little polling tool

1045
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,400
because i i'm trying i'll turn my video

1046
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,440
back on

1047
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,560
uh um i'm trying to get a sense of

1048
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,680
how many folks think that

1049
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,800
going through any of these processes to

1050
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,400
um re-document in some way whether it's

1051
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,640
you know another web page part of the

1052
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,520
dow

1053
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,640
um a new rfc whether

1054
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,680
those folks um are

1055
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,960
outnumbered by the let's just kill it in

1056
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,560
some way either by

1057
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,319
ignoring it or making it historic and

1058
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,040
moving on um

1059
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,000
uh what those numbers are looking like

1060
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,119
um

1061
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,480
i think we should have three three

1062
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,599
show hands for the three possible

1063
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,599
yeah the list here and

1064
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,400
stated so that would you be okay with

1065
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,079
the first option would you be okay with

1066
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:18,800
the second one

1067
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,760
so you're very welcome to to say i'm

1068
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,720
okay with the

1069
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,440
first or but absolutely not the second

1070
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,160
and third

1071
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,880
or i'm okay with the first and or the

1072
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,359
second

1073
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,400
and third um that might give us a better

1074
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
idea of

1075
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,839
bronn yeah

1076
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,400
i'm realizing that continue to ignore

1077
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,520
the problem is one of the offered

1078
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,720
options because that would certainly

1079
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,000
need to be one of the one of the things

1080
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,200
that people say whether they're okay

1081
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,400
with or not

1082
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
yeah right that that is one of the

1083
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,280
options yes

1084
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,839
and john

1085
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,680
yeah i i've realized this process this

1086
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,720
discussion that

1087
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,839
uh that my bullet two is really two

1088
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,440
different things is maybe two different

1089
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800
questions

1090
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,319
uh one of those is to publish a document

1091
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,000
somewhere which says

1092
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,119
uh that's obsolete hold your nose uh go

1093
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,720
look elsewhere

1094
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,640
and uh and the other is published

1095
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,200
document which says that's obsolete

1096
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
and these are the specific places to

1097
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,400
look for these other things

1098
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,920
and that was one of these came up at

1099
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,319
least in jabber and it's clearly an

1100
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,680
option here

1101
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,200
uh i uh i have problems with it because

1102
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,359
uh telling people to look at a list of

1103
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,000
things

1104
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,599
becomes a different kind of barrier to

1105
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,680
entry coming back to some other comments

1106
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,040
you made earlier

1107
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,960
but uh but i think that's really two

1108
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,200
separate options

1109
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,400
yeah i mean it's sort of why and

1110
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,200
and i'm happy to split it up but i the

1111
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,200
first thing i want to get a sense of and

1112
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,720
and maybe we'll ask these questions

1113
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,000
sequentially

1114
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,599
um and and have a little discussion

1115
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,520
between if we need to first thing i want

1116
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,680
to get a sense of is how many people

1117
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,720
really want to leave things exactly the

1118
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,000
way they are

1119
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,040
um how many people want to

1120
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,960
make this document historic or otherwise

1121
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,200
say this is obsolete

1122
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,240
and go no further um and and

1123
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,319
with those two answers i think maybe

1124
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:21,440
we'll have

1125
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,359
a little better so um okay i'm gonna

1126
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,000
take my hand at the tool here um

1127
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,760
everybody hang on tight

1128
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,920
um so um

1129
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,200
i i i think

1130
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,720
it's best to not do

1131
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,839
anything um

1132
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,200
so i'm going to start this up if you

1133
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,119
raise your hand that means i think it's

1134
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,800
best to not do anything

1135
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,760
if you actually click do not raise hand

1136
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,720
that means

1137
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,839
no i don't think that and if you ignore

1138
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,040
it you're just abstaining

1139
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,839
so

1140
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,480
yeah ecker go ahead while we're chugging

1141
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,520
along you please just

1142
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,520
yeah could you just please list out what

1143
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,200
all the options you're going to have are

1144
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,640
before so the next one is yeah yeah the

1145
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,079
next one is going to be because i

1146
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,520
i wanted to um hold off on the later two

1147
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,560
but the next one is gonna be um

1148
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,079
i'm i want to um

1149
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:27,280
uh obsolete the document in some way

1150
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,480
uh and and

1151
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,079
pause there and then ask separately

1152
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,200
questions regarding what to do after we

1153
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,319
obsolete it if that's

1154
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,160
the case um so this this one

1155
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,880
came out um or is coming out pretty much

1156
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,240
the way i thought it was going to come

1157
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,119
out

1158
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,720
which is just a few people

1159
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,839
really think it's okay to just say meh

1160
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
um

1161
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,400
and as far as i know you can't uh choose

1162
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,000
more than one thing

1163
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,040
yeah and steven explicitly says in

1164
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:05,599
jabber

1165
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,839
meh all right um well

1166
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:13,680
that's um four okay

1167
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,760
um okay so i'll end that

1168
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,559
and now um uh

1169
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,440
this one is i want to

1170
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,160
at least mark this document

1171
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,000
as obsolete or historic

1172
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,240
if that is a sufficient way to put it

1173
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,839
anybody object to me put it in that way

1174
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,240
uh okay um so here it goes number two

1175
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,119
please uh say what you want to say about

1176
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,839
that one

1177
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,319
good okay so so my guesses as to where

1178
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,839
the room were are looking pretty

1179
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,599
confirmed on this one

1180
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,599
um people at least want to mark the

1181
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,640
document

1182
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,400
as historic and just you know

1183
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,040
in general

1184
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,640
give it a little bit more time

1185
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,599
d to d anybody else wanna

1186
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,680
yeah good okay so yeah the the general

1187
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,720
sense of the room

1188
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,440
is doing absolutely nothing there's a

1189
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,200
few people who think that's a good idea

1190
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,880
but for the most part

1191
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,160
people want to at least mark the

1192
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,000
document as historic okay so we'll um

1193
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,119
that that seems like a good start so now

1194
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,880
um this is all the next two we're going

1195
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,880
to go on the assumption

1196
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,160
that we mark the document as obsolete or

1197
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,520
historic

1198
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,839
um the two choices are going to be and

1199
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,680
we're going to do these sequentially

1200
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,079
um i want to replace it with a new rfc

1201
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,040
and the other choice is i want to

1202
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,000
replace it

1203
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,079
with a new web page and i'll give you a

1204
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,119
third choice

1205
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,720
i want to replace it with some pointers

1206
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,119
to

1207
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,400
other uh web pages or information

1208
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,480
it can be bought for more than one of

1209
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,520
these

1210
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,240
yeah absolutely no i i'm trying to get a

1211
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,119
sense of

1212
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,240
where the room is uh stephen go ahead so

1213
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,760
pete i think you didn't have the option

1214
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,119
there is to just stop

1215
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,680
and do nothing else other than market as

1216
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,800
historically all right

1217
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,720
sorry yes no i i and i meant to yes

1218
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,400
you're absolutely right so yes that will

1219
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,160
also be uh colin did you want to follow

1220
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,480
up there

1221
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,079
i i was going to say the same thing as

1222
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,280
stephen so but basically i think the

1223
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,599
same thing

1224
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,920
at the web page stuff like i mean i

1225
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,640
think completely

1226
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
nothing to do with this document we need

1227
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,079
to improve our web pages for newcomers

1228
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:08,800
and whatever that's

1229
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,640
like a no-brainer but that's that's i

1230
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,119
don't i i i don't want to

1231
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,319
i think it's bad to confuse those well

1232
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,599
right so um yeah um the

1233
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,400
when i say i want there to be a new web

1234
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,280
page

1235
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,920
i'm i'm asking whether people think that

1236
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,160
we should have a focused web page

1237
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,520
on the organization and same thing with

1238
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,680
new rfc

1239
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,640
and then you know the choice of well i

1240
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,319
prefer

1241
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,760
a new web page that replaces that

1242
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,920
that provides the information content

1243
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,160
this document was trying to provide

1244
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,000
right that's that's what i'm looking for

1245
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,160
yep yep yep yep

1246
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,440
um uh wes and

1247
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,839
and then elliott when you say replace

1248
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,160
the replace with the new rfc or a new

1249
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,400
web page you don't discuss

1250
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,960
what the content of that will be again

1251
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,400
going back to what i was saying earlier

1252
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,280
are we going to just

1253
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,880
first document because otherwise you get

1254
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,920
into the question of yeah hey i'm

1255
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:10,880
raising right right

1256
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,760
right in both of these cases i'm the

1257
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,520
question i'm asking is

1258
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,359
just document existing practice if we

1259
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,920
can with understanding that

1260
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,280
uh you know uh you know dkg's comment

1261
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:23,760
that

1262
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,880
that's inevitably fraught with is this

1263
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,440
really

1264
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,079
the the current thing are we pushing for

1265
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:30,559
um

1266
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,200
stan you know uh adding structure where

1267
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,000
there really isn't

1268
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,760
some right now uh elliott go ahead

1269
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,440
yeah pete uh thanks the my confusion

1270
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,720
is that uh as as i think alyssa pointed

1271
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,119
out

1272
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,720
and others a lot of this information

1273
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,640
already exists on the itf webpage so

1274
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,319
which option do i choose if i just want

1275
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,200
to augment

1276
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,240
whatever is missing yeah um

1277
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,760
i think um and uh

1278
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,079
i'll just call i i like that framing of

1279
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,839
it because that could be

1280
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,920
you know either some additions to the

1281
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,599
current web page or

1282
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,839
some web page that has better pointers

1283
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,200
um so

1284
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,520
i'm i'm scribbling down for myself so

1285
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,839
nothing beyond obsoleting

1286
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,000
um uh augment

1287
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,040
current web pages

1288
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:27,759
uh new web page

1289
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:33,119
or new rfc

1290
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,000
alyssa go ahead

1291
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,359
so we had this experience when

1292
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:44,559
we converted from the previous

1293
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,800
version of the itf website to the

1294
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,079
current version

1295
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,160
which is that there's like a lot of

1296
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,359
croft

1297
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,520
and um the team that did that i think it

1298
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,800
felt compelled to like

1299
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,720
exactly reproduce what was on the

1300
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,000
previous um

1301
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,960
set of web pages in in the you know the

1302
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,240
current cms

1303
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,839
which is very painful process and my

1304
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,440
was something that i took away from that

1305
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,920
which is this sort of like

1306
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,040
um design of information

1307
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,720
in a collection of web pages by a large

1308
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,599
group is not a great strategy it doesn't

1309
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,000
yield

1310
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,559
really what you would want it to yield

1311
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,200
so

1312
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,680
if there can be sort of a generic option

1313
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,880
about

1314
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,800
you know ensuring that some set of

1315
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,319
information is available

1316
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,800
on the website or something like that

1317
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,839
that might be good

1318
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,200
getting into like really granular

1319
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,280
different choices about whether it's

1320
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:37,599
just

1321
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,559
augmentations or new pages or new

1322
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,400
sections of pages or whatever

1323
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,760
like it's it's very constraining for

1324
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,599
the people who actually have to like try

1325
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,760
to make the website usable

1326
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,680
right right fair enough right fair

1327
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,000
enough

1328
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,480
um eve sorry go ahead

1329
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,720
eve you have to unmute yourself i can't

1330
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,040
do it

1331
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,040
i'm so used to being co-chair and just

1332
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,640
having the mic open sorry

1333
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,599
[Laughter]

1334
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,880
anyway i don't know if this has been

1335
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,200
discussed before um

1336
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,599
but it it seems to me like part of what

1337
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,960
we're getting at is that there's this

1338
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,920
new class

1339
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,119
of document that when we have our keys

1340
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,280
and they get rewritten or updated

1341
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,400
there's betrayal

1342
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,200
around what populates other things when

1343
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:31,920
in fact

1344
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,559
what we're hinting towards and marching

1345
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:36,319
towards seems to be

1346
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,920
um a lie a living document

1347
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,400
and is has there been discussion about

1348
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,720
what these obsoleted documents point to

1349
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,280
is a living document on on the web

1350
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,160
somewhere

1351
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,040
hosted on the ietf website

1352
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,200
we did something like that with the tao

1353
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,440
right is we decided publishing this as

1354
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,880
an rfc

1355
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,520
has all sorts of problems and we

1356
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,359
tombstoned it and pointed to

1357
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,920
a website that ostensibly is supposed to

1358
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,000
get updated more frequently and

1359
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,119
and be a little more live um plus or

1360
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,680
minus that's true

1361
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,359
so is that considered a um

1362
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,280
something we have to do more regularly

1363
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,559
and should that be

1364
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,520
a new category of thing that we created

1365
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,640
as part of our rfc

1366
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,400
series yeah well that's a good question

1367
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,319
um uh i mean that that's sort of what

1368
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,160
i'm putting into the category of

1369
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,760
make a new web page um but i i hear

1370
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,799
alyssa's concern that um

1371
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,040
maybe we'll whittle this down to

1372
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,880
something needs to be done to keep

1373
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,040
things up to date on the web

1374
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,640
and and then uh if people

1375
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,319
are sort of leaning in that direction if

1376
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,559
that's the direction we're going

1377
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,240
um maybe we'll you know we'll uh

1378
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,880
uh figure out what it is people mean by

1379
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,000
that

1380
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,720
um so let me at least start asking the

1381
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,160
the easier questions

1382
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,000
so i'm first going to ask the i want to

1383
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,760
do nothing beyond obsoleting or making

1384
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,799
historic

1385
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,880
and seeing if there's a lot of support

1386
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,920
for that

1387
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,040
um so go ahead and raise or

1388
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:31,839
don't raise your hand to that one

1389
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,160
that's that's more interesting than the

1390
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:45,839
other ones

1391
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,720
also we have rudiger in the queue oh

1392
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,280
sorry while we're doing this go ahead

1393
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,960
yeah

1394
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,240
okay so see not sure i'm

1395
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,000
hurt yeah we can hear you no

1396
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
does not look like i am

1397
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:08,960
it appears that we can hear you but you

1398
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:12,880
can't hear us

1399
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,799
rudiger is going to go and try to figure

1400
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,359
out what his uh

1401
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,520
his tool is doing so we'll we'll get

1402
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,280
back to him

1403
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,200
um yes uh i think

1404
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,319
uh there was mention of

1405
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,760
a couple of pointers to the obsolete

1406
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,359
document

1407
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,640
pointers out of the

1408
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,200
rscs and

1409
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,400
if there are any such that are

1410
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,920
actually significant like being used

1411
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,839
in other bcps i think

1412
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:55,040
those need to be identified and kind of

1413
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,520
the dangling links

1414
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,280
dangling pointers need to be satisfied

1415
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,079
in some way

1416
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,359
at the bare minimum at least the

1417
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,359
potentially dangling pointers

1418
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,040
needs to be identified

1419
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,280
good point no i appreciate that thanks

1420
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,559
all right um well so that

1421
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,640
that particular one um yeah the the

1422
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,520
uh the people in the minority are

1423
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,960
certainly more than rough

1424
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,440
as we might say so let's read it out for

1425
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,640
the for the minutes

1426
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,640
maybe um so we have

1427
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,160
10 people who raised end and 25 who did

1428
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,599
not raise a hand

1429
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,240
on a total of 58 participants for i i

1430
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,520
want to do nothing beyond

1431
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,119
obsoleting or marking historic

1432
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,799
um so now i'm going to put

1433
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,000
the i want a new

1434
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,119
replacement rfc

1435
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,839
documenting existing

1436
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:07,279
practice with all of its caveats

1437
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,640
so that is now up feel free to poke at

1438
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:19,839
that one

1439
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:33,760
well now that's amusing

1440
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,200
and one person who's flipping back and

1441
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,119
forth that was very that was very funny

1442
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,440
thank you

1443
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,839
i i believe that is the um

1444
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,359
quintessential

1445
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,079
uh there ain't no consensus so for i

1446
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,319
want a new replacement rfc documenting

1447
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,760
existing practice

1448
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,040
it is uh 17 people click the raise hand

1449
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,440
button and 19 people click the

1450
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,559
uh don't raise hand button

1451
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,680
out of 58. i kind of like that elliot

1452
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,480
you had a comment

1453
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:14,319
pete um it seems to me that

1454
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,720
if this is how 17 people feel

1455
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,880
um then there should be at least some of

1456
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,200
those 17 people who are willing to do

1457
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,960
some writing

1458
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,319
and if they're willing to do some

1459
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:28,079
writing then we have something to talk

1460
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:28,400
about

1461
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,520
otherwise we don't in that context well

1462
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,559
sure although i will say that i

1463
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,440
take a good portion of those 19 people

1464
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:37,760
who

1465
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,760
click the do not raise hand button as

1466
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,040
explicitly not

1467
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,920
wanting there to be a new rfc to replace

1468
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,400
this one

1469
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,440
but if what i'm getting at pete is it

1470
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,520
it's one thing to abstractly say i don't

1471
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,119
want a new rfc but if somebody's going

1472
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,480
to write it

1473
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,319
then i think people might actually read

1474
01:00:58,319 --> 01:00:59,680
it and then they may have a different

1475
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,160
point of view

1476
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,160
it's possible um

1477
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,000
so we can ask a couple of years

1478
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,280
and we got rich we got maybe alexi

1479
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,559
in the chat it's worth

1480
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,880
asking if anybody else is

1481
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,839
would be willing to to help with this

1482
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,839
effort

1483
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,960
um and then the last question i want to

1484
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,640
ask is um

1485
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:37,119
uh and i'm going to ask it the general

1486
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,400
way that alyssa

1487
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,520
sort of did is i

1488
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,920
want web pages

1489
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,839
updated to

1490
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:53,440
um what do i want to say properly

1491
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,000
include

1492
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,960
the current state of this information

1493
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,520
boy that's obnoxiously long

1494
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,960
people okay with me asking that

1495
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,079
no one's whining loudly there you go

1496
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,240
have something to poke at i want web

1497
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,520
pages updated to

1498
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,520
pro well i didn't even get the d and

1499
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,000
updated

1500
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,920
also we are uh time check

1501
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,920
yes sorry and

1502
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,240
the yeah are aware yes

1503
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,079
and john go ahead in the meantime

1504
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,039
yeah i just wanted to point out that one

1505
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,440
could want to update the web pages

1506
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,760
and still believe that having an rfc is

1507
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:52,480
a good idea

1508
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,680
absolutely absolutely i know and we did

1509
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,480
not limit

1510
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,000
people to one choice yeah and and to a

1511
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,520
certain extent

1512
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,160
uh the amount of work needed is overlaps

1513
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,200
very heavily

1514
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,400
getting back to early support yeah

1515
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,960
i took a lot of the do not raise hand on

1516
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,520
the

1517
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,079
the rfc thing is people actually

1518
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:15,200
indicating

1519
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,160
i i think doing it on the web is fine

1520
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,839
but doing it in rfc is not

1521
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,599
so um okay

1522
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,200
yeah and we've got um 26 to 2

1523
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,240
out of the 58 on that question um

1524
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,920
i think that's enough information to

1525
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,680
bring back to the list

1526
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,319
and get uh you know a dispatch out of

1527
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:38,400
this of some form or another

1528
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,559
um and people i mean elliot's point is

1529
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:41,920
well taken

1530
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:45,119
we we can sort of re-ask of people

1531
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,160
would be it would doing an rfc be okay

1532
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,079
if someone else was gonna write it not

1533
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,680
me um

1534
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,920
and and find out how that goes but this

1535
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,359
is at least sufficient information to

1536
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,200
bring back to the list and get some

1537
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,400
get some feedback on um to dispatch this

1538
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,760
but i i

1539
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,920
i at least smell where this is going i

1540
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,520
think

1541
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,280
um anything else on this john go ahead

1542
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,920
yeah another observation along those

1543
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,039
lines in terms of what to write up

1544
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,839
in which i at least if we're going to do

1545
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,680
this by webpage

1546
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,280
we'd like to see the same degree of

1547
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,880
community consensus

1548
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,440
about what that web piece says as we

1549
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,000
would expect

1550
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,680
from rfc so let's

1551
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,760
let's not pretend that the web page is

1552
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,520
easier in that regard

1553
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,880
even though it might be easier in other

1554
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,720
respects

1555
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,280
sure sure sure uh echo

1556
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,799
and echo will be last and then we'll get

1557
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,039
to our next uh go around here yeah so

1558
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,559
actually i think i disagree with john

1559
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:47,599
said i think that like

1560
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,280
one of the key elements or web pages is

1561
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,400
not have to have this interview

1562
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,839
community consensus and it can be just

1563
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:52,880
largely written

1564
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,599
and then we can take you know feedback

1565
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:56,480
um

1566
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,119
and you know and revise it as we go um

1567
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:00,240
but the the the

1568
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:01,280
you know part of what makes our

1569
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,640
documents inaccessible is the fact that

1570
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,319
they have the workshop so that everybody

1571
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,880
like you know loves them in exactly the

1572
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,079
same way and every because they're

1573
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:08,559
decent

1574
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:09,839
and that would not be helpful in this

1575
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,160
instance

1576
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,400
that then we're at risk of ending up

1577
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,319
either with eckerd's opinion or my

1578
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:17,280
opinion

1579
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,520
about uh about what it is the

1580
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,280
organizational structure is

1581
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,359
and that's different from an ietf

1582
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,799
statement or what the organizational

1583
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,000
structure is

1584
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,760
uh that doesn't necessarily have to be

1585
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,200
that way but it's a danger

1586
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,599
i think we need to cut the discussion

1587
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,119
here

1588
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,960
we have uh yeah thank you okay

1589
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,960
good well thank you all that was useful

1590
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,319
and i think we have uh

1591
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:46,640
good stuff to bring back to the list uh

1592
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,440
and

1593
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,880
um thank uh uh who is i'm sorry

1594
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,599
who was doing the uh minute taking here

1595
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,559
uh michael

1596
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,839
and kirsty and and and kirsten um

1597
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,720
yes who are who are taking um close to

1598
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,359
seconds

1599
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,440
not minutes but but very helpful

1600
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,640
nonetheless

1601
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,200
all right uh fernando keith you're up to

1602
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,160
bat

1603
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,839
and you have to hit me pretty much the

1604
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:11,280
rest of the session yes

1605
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,319
just fine go ahead okay um

1606
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:17,039
so i'm fernando and i will be uh

1607
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,000
presenting the

1608
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,440
document on diversity and inclusiveness

1609
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,640
in the itf um it's a document that we

1610
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,640
co-author with keith moore

1611
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,359
and this document arrives as a result of

1612
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,000
the

1613
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,200
discussions that um we have had on the

1614
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,200
gen dispatch mailing list while uh

1615
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,640
chartering the

1616
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,000
the term working group okay so

1617
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,480
next slide

1618
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,119
okay um i think that one of the things

1619
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,480
that you know became

1620
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,960
uh you know clear while we were uh

1621
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,839
discussing

1622
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,920
uh this topic of diversity and

1623
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,680
inclusiveness is that

1624
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,720
you know to a large extent um you know

1625
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,839
uh different people were referring to or

1626
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,599
were implying different things

1627
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,839
when they were uh you know talking about

1628
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:04,640
diversity

1629
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,920
and inclusion so in order to you know

1630
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,400
to frame the discussion in an upright

1631
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,359
way uh

1632
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,680
let's clarify what we mean by each of

1633
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,799
these things

1634
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,960
um so the first of the terms is

1635
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,000
diversity

1636
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,839
which essentially throughout the

1637
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:21,119
document we

1638
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,240
use to imply us showing a great deal of

1639
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,880
variety like different things so we look

1640
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,039
at the organization the itf we look at

1641
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:30,480
itf leadership

1642
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,760
and we expect to see variety okay then

1643
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,200
there is a different term which

1644
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,599
uh is related to diversity but implies

1645
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,559
different things

1646
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,520
which is inclusion which essentially

1647
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:42,240
talks about

1648
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,200
a culture and an environment uh where

1649
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,799
everyone has equal chances to

1650
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,079
participate

1651
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,480
so this means that inclusion has to do

1652
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,440
with providing

1653
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,880
providing an environment uh that

1654
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,920
essentially fosters diversity okay

1655
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,039
um throughout our document for the most

1656
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:01,520
part

1657
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,039
what we try to work on is on inclusion

1658
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,160
and have diversity um as

1659
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,960
a side effect of that inclusion okay so

1660
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,880
what do we mean by variety

1661
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,640
which i referred to before and this is

1662
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,479
something that you know also was

1663
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:17,920
discussed on the mailing list

1664
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,520
we essentially you know um mean

1665
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,679
every possible aspect that you can think

1666
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,560
of like

1667
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,719
range of different social and ethnic

1668
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,640
backgrounds different genders different

1669
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,238
sexual orientations

1670
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:32,080
different countries and regions uh

1671
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,080
different types of organizations company

1672
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,080
non-profits etc

1673
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,880
uh this is just a sample of some of the

1674
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:39,679
things that

1675
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,799
uh we mean by variety but this list is

1676
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:45,439
uh non-exhaustive and is in no

1677
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,640
particular order

1678
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,600
okay so this means that when we talk

1679
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,799
about diversity

1680
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,198
we want to see we want uh you know

1681
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:54,799
variety or diversity

1682
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:57,520
in each of these uh different aspects

1683
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,759
and categories if you wish

1684
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,799
uh next slide

1685
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,520
uh okay so what we try to do in our

1686
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,560
document which

1687
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,120
you can think of as a problem statement

1688
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,920
document

1689
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,198
is to try to analyze uh different

1690
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,439
aspects that uh essentially are

1691
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,198
structural issues

1692
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,560
that um make the ietf

1693
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,158
not as inclusive as we might wish okay

1694
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:28,960
so there are uh several categories that

1695
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,960
we have identified perceived return of

1696
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:31,759
investment

1697
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,359
effects of current participation

1698
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,439
diversity in its groups and leadership

1699
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:36,238
roles

1700
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,439
processes etc etc so um

1701
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:42,158
obviously we will not discuss uh the you

1702
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:42,560
know

1703
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,359
the details of this that's what the id

1704
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,238
is there for

1705
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,399
the draft is there therefore but we will

1706
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,679
um you know simply

1707
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,920
skim through uh you know some of these

1708
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:52,799
things

1709
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:55,759
uh next slide

1710
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,440
so first one is uh the perceived return

1711
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:00,320
of investment

1712
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,640
uh like you know when you know obviously

1713
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,520
participation

1714
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,560
take uh takes time efforts money

1715
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,840
at times too um and uh you know

1716
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,159
for people that people and organizations

1717
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:13,440
that you know participate

1718
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,400
in the itf they are obviously have a

1719
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,400
motivation for doing so

1720
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,560
uh in the case of you know organizations

1721
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:21,679
companies uh

1722
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,560
among the possible reasons are that they

1723
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,760
might benefit from

1724
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,719
iprs uh they might also benefit for

1725
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,080
example from

1726
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,239
leading leading the leading or

1727
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:34,320
participating in the standardization

1728
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,960
effort which at times can result in an

1729
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,080
improved time to market

1730
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,480
for example for independent participants

1731
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,480
that might be done because they they

1732
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,640
believe in making a difference

1733
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,040
uh by improving internet technologies

1734
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:50,719
something that might apply too of course

1735
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:52,400
to organizations

1736
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,360
and also for uh you know improving their

1737
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,880
career opportunities

1738
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,360
uh now if you think about these things

1739
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,480
this possible return of investment

1740
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:06,159
they can only be realized by a small

1741
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:10,320
subset of organizations and individuals

1742
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,560
for example there are organizations that

1743
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,400
or companies that don't manufacture

1744
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,120
products

1745
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,040
so obviously they wouldn't be able to

1746
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,960
leverage from an improved time to market

1747
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,000
so to speak so

1748
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
i mean we won't get into the details but

1749
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,840
you know you get the idea of what we are

1750
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,120
talking about here

1751
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,840
next slide

1752
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,080
uh second one is the effects of current

1753
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:32,960
participation

1754
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,600
okay so obviously uh current

1755
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,640
participation

1756
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,040
is reflects you know the previous slide

1757
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,560
that we have seen

1758
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,000
and uh you know for obvious reasons uh

1759
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,239
the current participation results in a

1760
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:48,159
bias in a number of areas

1761
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:50,239
first one is perception perception of

1762
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:51,440
structural issues

1763
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,880
okay um it's obviously uh you know

1764
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,159
harder in a way to

1765
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,040
to to perceive or understand uh let's

1766
01:11:59,040 --> 01:11:59,520
say

1767
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,679
a problem or a challenge that yeah you

1768
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,640
are not uh you know facing yourself

1769
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,960
um current participation obviously has a

1770
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,480
bias on the

1771
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,480
face-to-face meeting rotation normally

1772
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,760
meetings are held

1773
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,840
in you know areas where most of the

1774
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,120
participants come from

1775
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,159
so one thing leads to the other uh

1776
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,239
the other thing is that uh obviously the

1777
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,400
diversity that we have in itf groups and

1778
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,360
leadership

1779
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,520
reflects the diversity that we have in

1780
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,760
the community to some extent or another

1781
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,640
okay and you know finally this has an

1782
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,960
effect on you know how new work is

1783
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,159
um you know considered by the idf

1784
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:38,719
next slide

1785
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,640
um so part of that uh

1786
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,400
you know part of the you know lack of

1787
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,320
diversity or reduced diversity that you

1788
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,320
know we have in participation obviously

1789
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,120
reflects in

1790
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,000
uh in the diversity in atf uh groups and

1791
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,440
leadership roles

1792
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,239
uh and the effect of that is that there

1793
01:12:58,239 --> 01:12:58,880
is a

1794
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,600
small number of interests essentially

1795
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,640
you know judging

1796
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,960
uh working group consensus community

1797
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:05,840
consensus

1798
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,760
all appeals in the case that there are

1799
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,440
appeals uh

1800
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,600
something similar happens for you know

1801
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,040
for the case of the non-com

1802
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,239
and the aib similar stuff and

1803
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,800
in some cases you may also have uh

1804
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,560
arbitrary decisions

1805
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,120
that uh you know are produced and

1806
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,480
enforced by such groups

1807
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,480
uh you know without a lot of uh

1808
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,120
community consensus on them

1809
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,679
uh next slide

1810
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,040
uh other things uh processes there are

1811
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,640
some things there are some of our

1812
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,080
process that are kind of like

1813
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,280
loosely specified um

1814
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,280
and this can be beneficial in some

1815
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,360
scenarios that because you know it gives

1816
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,960
freedom for example to work in group

1817
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:49,600
chairs

1818
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,480
regarding to how to handle processes but

1819
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,480
in other cases uh you know it can be

1820
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,560
problematic for participants because for

1821
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,800
example they don't know what to expect

1822
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,840
like the the expectations uh um you know

1823
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,679
are uh you know are uh don't necessarily

1824
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:08,320
match uh you know what actually happens

1825
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:08,719
you know

1826
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,239
in our processes uh one example of this

1827
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,159
for example is ongoing work on

1828
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:17,840
um working group adoption of documents

1829
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,000
with you know tries to you know improve

1830
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,880
uh

1831
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,840
in that aspect next slide

1832
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,679
uh another one is the difficulty in

1833
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:32,480
joining or participating in the ietf

1834
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,440
uh well first of all finding interesting

1835
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,120
groups and areas there are so many of

1836
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:37,440
them

1837
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,120
that at times particularly for a

1838
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,360
newcomer it may be challenging to

1839
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,239
identify uh you know what's the uh

1840
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:45,679
working group where they might

1841
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,960
be able to contribute uh which working

1842
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,000
group they should

1843
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,159
you know take a proposal if they have

1844
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:54,000
any and so on

1845
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,960
uh there are also challenges that um you

1846
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:57,679
know involve

1847
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,560
authoring and submitting internet trust

1848
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:00,960
uh

1849
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,360
this of course has to do among other

1850
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,320
things you know

1851
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,719
with the requirements that you know

1852
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,760
internet reps have to comply with per se

1853
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,840
which nowadays i guess you know for most

1854
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,960
of most of us

1855
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,960
if you need to produce an internet draft

1856
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,080
there's not

1857
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:18,400
you know you need to rely on on some of

1858
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,760
the tools to do that

1859
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,840
because of the number of requirements uh

1860
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,239
that may be a challenge for particularly

1861
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,679
for newcomers

1862
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:28,640
um there are also for example in the

1863
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,280
case of

1864
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,840
xml to rfc there are different versions

1865
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,560
i

1866
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,320
for example i uh you know you might be

1867
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,000
able to handle version two

1868
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,920
kind of like quite well maybe not so

1869
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,640
much version 3 etc etc

1870
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,480
and when it comes to discussion there

1871
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,000
are also challenges there

1872
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,560
there are people that you know find uh

1873
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,159
you know the discussions on the mailing

1874
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,320
lists uh kind of like challenging

1875
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,640
you know from from having to subscribe

1876
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,480
to specific mailing lists

1877
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,000
long threads etc etc etc uh

1878
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,159
and for some of them the use of github

1879
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,360
by working groups it's

1880
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,600
you know can be a great improvement

1881
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,520
whereas on the other hand there might be

1882
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,320
uh people

1883
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:09,120
that you know uh might be used to using

1884
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,560
the mailing list but

1885
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:12,880
might not be that familiar with github

1886
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,760
so for

1887
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,840
you know that other community github

1888
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,280
might represent the challenge

1889
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,120
and obviously the decision on you know

1890
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,560
on what to use and the

1891
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,480
extent to which these things are used

1892
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,960
you know represents a trade-off

1893
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,280
necessarily uh next one

1894
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,920
so another one is economic constraints

1895
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,520
um

1896
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,239
you know obviously the the the process

1897
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:38,960
uh well

1898
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,640
not right now because of the pandemic

1899
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,719
but you know uh you know normal time so

1900
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,000
pre-pandemic times

1901
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,239
uh the processes obviously favor uh you

1902
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,440
know people that kind of

1903
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,640
that can attend face-to-face uh meetings

1904
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,800
uh there are a lot of expenses

1905
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,239
associated with you know

1906
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,480
uh with attending meetings travel

1907
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,360
accommodation

1908
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,840
you know dinners breakfast lunches and

1909
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,840
so on

1910
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,760
uh most of them you know in a way we

1911
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,040
don't control

1912
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,600
and there's also the um you know the

1913
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,400
issue of

1914
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,920
meeting phase which you know is

1915
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,920
something that is you know more in

1916
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,120
under our control um you know in this

1917
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,679
respect

1918
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:18,000
i do believe that you know this document

1919
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,880
in the schmo

1920
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,840
uh working group uh is a really really

1921
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,400
good thing

1922
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,239
and it's a step in in the right

1923
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,679
direction obviously

1924
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,400
it doesn't and it can't i address some

1925
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,080
of the other expenses which are you know

1926
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:31,679
impossible to address

1927
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,080
by the itf but i do think that it helps

1928
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,920
a lot in that area

1929
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,199
uh next slide

1930
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,960
there are also educational constraints

1931
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,600
um you know normally in order to you

1932
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:46,320
know become

1933
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,440
involved in the ietf uh you need uh to

1934
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,280
have at least some knowledge of

1935
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,760
you know a lot of uh you know different

1936
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:54,560
topics

1937
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,320
uh you know and you know a little bit

1938
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,080
about internet protocols a little bit

1939
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,600
about transport protocols

1940
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,719
congestion control dns etc etc

1941
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,080
uh that may be uh you know um

1942
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,719
a challenge uh you know for many people

1943
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:09,199
uh

1944
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,120
we are talking about newcomers in in

1945
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,560
particular right like you know people

1946
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:12,960
that

1947
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,239
would like to join and participate and

1948
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,880
at times uh there is you know another

1949
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:19,920
related uh

1950
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,480
issue if you wish is that uh you know

1951
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,920
normally if you want to work on

1952
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,560
improving

1953
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,679
uh you know protocols uh you not only

1954
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,760
need to uh have knowledge about the

1955
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,040
protocol itself but

1956
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,040
you know you also need to be able to do

1957
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,480
some critical thinking

1958
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,120
uh such as you know not just taking the

1959
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,880
technology for granted and assume that

1960
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,800
that's the best way to do things but

1961
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,480
understand the pros and cons

1962
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,159
and also understand that you know in

1963
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:45,920
many cases what you have in protocols

1964
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:46,880
are essentially

1965
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,199
historical artifacts that probably if we

1966
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:50,960
were to reduce some things we wouldn't

1967
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,480
do them in the same way

1968
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,520
so that's important for um you know um

1969
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,440
you know if you want to contribute and

1970
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,440
the other one is real-world experience

1971
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,239
like for example operational experience

1972
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,440
uh

1973
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,520
next slide uh i think this is the

1974
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,280
the final one when it comes to the you

1975
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,960
know different aspects of

1976
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,840
areas it has to do with cultural issues

1977
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,960
first one is language

1978
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,960
like for example the recent discussion

1979
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,520
on on the gen dispatch mainly this was

1980
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,560
uh you know about inclusive terminology

1981
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,360
um but language itself you know can be

1982
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,159
challenged

1983
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,400
can be challenging in you know many

1984
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,520
different ways like

1985
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,480
uh i would uh probably argue that for a

1986
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,679
large number of us

1987
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:35,760
um you know we speak english as a second

1988
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,159
language and that can be a challenge

1989
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,280
uh at times uh you know uh people that

1990
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,960
speak english as a native

1991
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,679
as a native language might use uh let's

1992
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:46,960
say expression

1993
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,880
expressions or jokes that for a

1994
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,560
non-native english speaker

1995
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,800
you know might have no meaning or might

1996
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,840
might be difficult to

1997
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,040
comprehend uh you know at times during

1998
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,960
presentations this can also be a

1999
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,840
challenge

2000
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,239
uh you know for those that you know

2001
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,719
speak english as a second language

2002
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:07,840
uh using email effectively might also

2003
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,880
be a challenge you know long threads uh

2004
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,080
you know the way in which

2005
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,880
uh we you know technical community

2006
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,719
employs email you know no

2007
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,560
um no html email you know we we

2008
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,120
uh quote parts of the you know the the

2009
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:25,760
email that we want to respond and so on

2010
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,159
and there are also issues that are

2011
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:29,199
associated with the

2012
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:31,440
you know with the comfort zone uh they

2013
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,880
may be related with

2014
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,679
culture itself you know in some cultures

2015
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:37,520
at times the kind of discussions that we

2016
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:39,199
may have in the ietf

2017
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,280
might not be let's say culturally

2018
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,520
culturally acceptable for them

2019
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,520
uh there are other issues like there

2020
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,280
might be people working in certain

2021
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:47,760
fields

2022
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,159
that you know the fact that they occupy

2023
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,040
a certain

2024
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,960
role or certain position in the company

2025
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,560
means that you know they

2026
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,040
uh they don't get involved into certain

2027
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,719
kinds of discussions whereas you know in

2028
01:20:58,719 --> 01:20:59,440
the itf

2029
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,440
essentially you are supposed to be

2030
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,920
willing to uh you know what to debate

2031
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,920
your ideas uh proposals and

2032
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,320
and so on uh next slide

2033
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,120
uh so before actually uh you know the

2034
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,000
the discussing

2035
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,719
the slide and the moving forward thing

2036
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:17,280
um

2037
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,760
let me just mention that you know while

2038
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:20,719
talking to the

2039
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:24,239
to the chairs um we agreed uh to

2040
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,239
essentially uh split the presentation in

2041
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,560
two parts uh the first part

2042
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,480
uh the problem statement which is what

2043
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,600
we have here

2044
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,159
and the second part uh to have some

2045
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:35,199
proposals

2046
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:37,760
for some of the topics that uh we have

2047
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:38,400
discussed

2048
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,080
so uh we could now uh you know

2049
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,639
focus and discuss you know what could be

2050
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:45,760
a good next step

2051
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,719
for this problem statement and uh you

2052
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:49,600
know once we

2053
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,920
make a decision on that then we can

2054
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,639
discuss

2055
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,719
the you know some of the proposals that

2056
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,199
we have for um

2057
01:21:57,199 --> 01:21:59,199
uh you know for addressing some of these

2058
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:00,719
issues among the

2059
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,320
you know among the possible options i

2060
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,600
guess uh is uh an ad sponsored document

2061
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,320
the other possible option would be the

2062
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,639
creation of a you know new working group

2063
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:11,040
to

2064
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,639
you know work on the problem statement

2065
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:14,880
and possible solutions but this is of

2066
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,719
course for the you know working group to

2067
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,360
to discuss

2068
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,280
yeah and i think um you know a

2069
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,159
subcategory

2070
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:27,280
of new working group is well not quite

2071
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,800
sure given what you've said

2072
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,120
uh this could use a buff a full boss

2073
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,960
devoted completely to this topic to sort

2074
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,239
of sort out

2075
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:36,080
whether this is worth the working group

2076
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,600
or not um

2077
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,280
so should we have a little discussion

2078
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,440
here on the moving forward piece

2079
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,639
is that the plan yeah definitely

2080
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,960
i think like the two parts are separate

2081
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:48,960
like we have some proposals for some

2082
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,760
things

2083
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,360
but you know first of all i think the

2084
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,040
most important thing is to agree on the

2085
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,239
problem

2086
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:56,719
yep all right so do people want to talk

2087
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:57,840
about the

2088
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,159
directions forward whether this sounds

2089
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:01,280
like a

2090
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,840
way to go forward um keith did you want

2091
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,520
to just jump in since you're

2092
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,600
co-authored here go right ahead

2093
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,880
um so

2094
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,080
if we're really going to try to improve

2095
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,639
uh diversity inclusion in itf it's a

2096
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:19,199
very

2097
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:23,840
broad topic and any kind of

2098
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,639
remedies would i mean it's the sort of

2099
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:27,920
thing that you would address

2100
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,280
differently in different parts of the

2101
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,880
organization or in affiliated

2102
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,560
organizations

2103
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,159
and so it seems like a lot for any

2104
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:37,360
single working group

2105
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:41,520
and it's especially because

2106
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,600
some things could be tools some things

2107
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,360
could be structural changes some things

2108
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,600
could be better documentation

2109
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,880
it's possible to imagine um

2110
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,639
some sort of ongoing organization

2111
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,560
probably not a working group

2112
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,520
that is tasked with keeping track of how

2113
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,040
well we're doing in this and maybe

2114
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,280
making recommendations or maybe

2115
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:04,880
whatever there are existing efforts

2116
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,679
and maybe some efforts that have existed

2117
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:09,120
in the past that

2118
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:12,560
didn't go as far as we would like

2119
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,440
i do believe that diversity and

2120
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,520
inclusion basically require

2121
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,920
uh a commitment to continue its

2122
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,560
improvement

2123
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,120
that's not the sort of thing that go

2124
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,000
ahead

2125
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,639
yeah i i just want to say that um we

2126
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:27,760
probably

2127
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,600
don't need to necessarily get caught up

2128
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,840
in titles because of course we've had

2129
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,120
sort of long long view working groups

2130
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:35,440
that

2131
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,080
last forever like this one for instance

2132
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:38,560
which

2133
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,120
sort of either do dispatching or say

2134
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,800
this really needs to be handled in this

2135
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,679
way

2136
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,480
so whether the structure we use happens

2137
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,679
to be a working group

2138
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:50,639
i think what's important is laying out

2139
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:51,440
what we

2140
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,600
what we want that whatever that entity

2141
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,800
is to do

2142
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,920
um so it doesn't necessarily have to

2143
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:59,360
look like a traditional working group

2144
01:24:59,360 --> 01:24:59,760
with

2145
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,360
particular um you know uh milestones and

2146
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,480
goals for

2147
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:07,280
you know this document that document and

2148
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:07,520
i

2149
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,920
kind of don't care what it's called but

2150
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,159
uh i do think that sometimes we get in a

2151
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:13,840
habit of working that is

2152
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,520
conditioned by working in so many

2153
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,199
working groups where

2154
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,120
the goal is to publish some documents

2155
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,480
and be done and

2156
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,440
i kind of think if the structure of

2157
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,239
whatever this ends up being doesn't

2158
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,440
encourage that

2159
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,480
that habit maybe we're better off but

2160
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:30,800
it's

2161
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,199
uh i think it's a topic to be sort of

2162
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,159
discussed among

2163
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:37,120
uh leadership because clearly i don't i

2164
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,239
don't think we're going to be able to

2165
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:39,920
figure this out it requires a lot of

2166
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,360
sensitivity to different parts of the

2167
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,120
organization

2168
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,840
um so anyway exactly what it looks like

2169
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,639
i don't know

2170
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,440
i'd like to see some sort of effort

2171
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,040
appreciate it and stick

2172
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,880
and go ahead and feel free to leave

2173
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,040
yourself either unmuted or on the screen

2174
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,639
as we go through this and same with

2175
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:58,239
fernando um

2176
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,600
so andrew you were next in the queue uh

2177
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,840
yeah so on you know given that there's

2178
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,520
some i think some good recommendations

2179
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,400
to come

2180
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,440
um i think this is a helpful

2181
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,560
um presentation i think it captures

2182
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,320
uh and identifies a really important

2183
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,320
topic for what it's worth i think this

2184
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,239
is far more important than the

2185
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:20,639
already potentially challenging topic of

2186
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:22,239
uh how to handle a few

2187
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:26,320
problem phrases um i think this is the

2188
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,600
significant underlying issue uh that

2189
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,480
needs action

2190
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,239
and i think an important first step is

2191
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:34,480
acknowledging that there is a problem of

2192
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,000
diversity in in

2193
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,120
many forms um uh perhaps

2194
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,239
measuring that in some way um and then

2195
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,040
looking

2196
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,840
at what actions to take but i think just

2197
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,199
at least getting agreement that it's a

2198
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:48,719
problem that needs addressing is a

2199
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,000
pretty decent start so

2200
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,400
thank you

2201
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,040
um stephen go right ahead uh

2202
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,600
so i don't think this topic is ready to

2203
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,000
dispatch in the normal sense

2204
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,719
i do think it would be great to see work

2205
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,800
of some sort continue

2206
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,040
uh a buff sounds initially attractive

2207
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,199
but kind of has a catch 22 doesn't it

2208
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,880
uh because if you don't do it face to

2209
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,639
face it's going to be lacking enormously

2210
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,080
and if you do it face to face it's going

2211
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:17,760
to exclude everybody you want to

2212
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,800
kind of get attracted

2213
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,320
so yeah there is amazingness as i

2214
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,480
pointed out in the chat it wasn't

2215
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,920
necessarily intended exactly for this

2216
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,840
but it might be useful

2217
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,560
of the topics covered in the draft

2218
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,080
personally i think the

2219
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,679
economic exclusion is by far the biggest

2220
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:36,400
barrier

2221
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,000
uh that's significant for what we want

2222
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,719
to do uh if there was some way to tackle

2223
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:42,159
that i'm not convinced there is but if

2224
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:42,960
there was

2225
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,000
that could be you know a sub-topic that

2226
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,440
might produce something tractable

2227
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,120
somehow that could produce

2228
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,480
uh some improvement and and just to

2229
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:54,000
highlight something just explain

2230
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,679
something from the chat

2231
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:57,120
when i say that i think time is the

2232
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,600
biggest barrier it's the ability to

2233
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,639
spend the time

2234
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,520
on the stuff the itf cares about and not

2235
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,199
have to work on your day job because

2236
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:05,760
you're

2237
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,960
you know a bus driver is i think the

2238
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,639
barrier that's what i mean

2239
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:12,880
um it's not the case that i'm not

2240
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,239
talking about a consultant who has to

2241
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:15,360
who's so busy making

2242
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,120
a thousand books an hour that they can't

2243
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,440
be asked uh so

2244
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,800
that's it so yeah i think madding this

2245
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,560
discussion continues probably the best

2246
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,760
yeah concrete outcome

2247
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,560
well perhaps we need to spin up a

2248
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,480
mailing list for this topic so that it

2249
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,120
doesn't

2250
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,960
uh conflict with other discussions on

2251
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,639
gen dispatch

2252
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,120
and and stephen uh mentioned in the chat

2253
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,480
that there is a diversity

2254
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,159
at itf.org that exists and was last used

2255
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:45,199
around three years ago

2256
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:49,199
i can take a look at that i think it is

2257
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,159
uh i think it's important to

2258
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:54,480
understand that diversity and inclusion

2259
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:55,920
or the inclusiveness or whatever word

2260
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,639
you want to use

2261
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,639
are somewhat different things and uh

2262
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:02,560
we it's easy for us to sort of lump them

2263
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:04,639
in together it is actually possible for

2264
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,400
them to conflict

2265
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,560
so i just want i just want to try to

2266
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,159
tease those apart and be careful

2267
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:11,520
about which we're talking about in which

2268
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,360
we're understanding you could make

2269
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,840
ietf more inclusive and the result be

2270
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,360
that it's less diverse

2271
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,960
i don't think that's necessarily a good

2272
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,280
result it is possible

2273
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,800
so um anyway just try to keep the topic

2274
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,719
separate in our minds i think and just

2275
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,480
they are somewhat different um

2276
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,280
both desirable

2277
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,480
yeah i think we should try to learn from

2278
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,239
what other standards bodies are doing

2279
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:41,520
um for example the w3c has an inclusion

2280
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,280
and diversity community group

2281
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,800
um it's so i think

2282
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,639
at least in the long run probably this

2283
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:49,920
belongs as

2284
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,480
as some some persistent body rather than

2285
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,679
just a mailing list

2286
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,920
um i don't know if that's the time for

2287
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:57,120
that is right now

2288
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,960
um i think 80 sponsored would be a

2289
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,639
mistake even for the problem statement

2290
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:01,600
because

2291
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,000
uh like we're we're seeing that lots of

2292
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,199
people have things to

2293
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:08,480
to put into it um that kind of one

2294
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,400
one set of authors isn't really

2295
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,679
sufficient to to cover

2296
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,600
and i also asked on the jabber room

2297
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,719
um if perhaps an ib program is is better

2298
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:21,199
than

2299
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,600
than a working group because the scope

2300
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:24,719
is is

2301
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,719
the scope of things that need to change

2302
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:28,400
is potentially bigger than

2303
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,000
than the stuff that a working group

2304
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,120
tends to to tackle

2305
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,320
uh elliot go ahead

2306
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,960
and uh hi again uh first thanks keith

2307
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,520
and uh fernando for the work you did on

2308
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,639
this draft

2309
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,360
um i really appreciate it this is a

2310
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,400
problem

2311
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,080
that we can't not uh

2312
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,120
talk about we have to engage on it uh

2313
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:59,520
two a couple of observations first of

2314
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,360
all this isn't our first

2315
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,400
attempt at this um and we've had at

2316
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:04,719
least

2317
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:08,080
some success here or there um and uh

2318
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,400
i'm thinking of the work that kathleen

2319
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,159
and uh

2320
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,960
suresh did a while back um that they

2321
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,480
presented in berlin

2322
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,440
and that was a big a good beginning and

2323
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,239
i think it

2324
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:24,159
did it has helped at times

2325
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,400
um there are a couple of other efforts

2326
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,239
that i always think about when we talk

2327
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,320
about this like the i saw fellows effort

2328
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,239
in terms of bringing people in who might

2329
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,000
otherwise not be

2330
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,120
um available and i think of the

2331
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,560
uh 1-1-1 star

2332
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:43,199
policy that we have in terms of how we

2333
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:45,040
meet and how we've been meeting over the

2334
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:45,760
last year

2335
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,440
and i say this as the person who wrote a

2336
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,400
draft that was that is entirely obe

2337
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,159
called draft leader we got to stop

2338
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:53,760
meeting like this

2339
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:58,719
um so i'm wondering then if there are

2340
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,920
multiple paths to dispatch this is sort

2341
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,280
of in parallel

2342
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:05,760
um to a point that that's been made in

2343
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,920
the jabber and elsewhere

2344
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,920
um what is it how do we know when we've

2345
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,360
succeeded

2346
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:12,639
usually involves some amount of

2347
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,719
collection of data and analysis

2348
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:18,239
we have people who can help us i think

2349
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:21,040
do that they need to organize to do that

2350
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:21,840
they should be

2351
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,600
doing so in a collaborative way with the

2352
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:25,360
community and i wonder if we can

2353
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,000
dispatch

2354
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,280
some of this off to jay um

2355
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,000
in order to to ask for his help uh in

2356
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,239
terms of finding out what sort of data

2357
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:35,679
we can collect

2358
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,760
that might be useful in figuring out you

2359
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,080
know how deep of a hole we're in what

2360
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,719
sort of problems we have

2361
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:44,719
and then uh what we could do to to

2362
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:46,159
address them so

2363
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:49,440
as as uh steven opined uh

2364
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:51,120
he thought most of the problems were

2365
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,199
economical okay that's that is

2366
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,719
definitely one axis

2367
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:56,800
um there are others and the question is

2368
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,880
uh who's affected in which dimension

2369
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:02,400
and by how much and so uh that's one

2370
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,520
area and then the second i think is i do

2371
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,800
like the idea

2372
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,880
of this community finding a place to

2373
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:10,719
continue this conversation to develop

2374
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:11,760
the ideas

2375
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,920
to talk to to develop a problem

2376
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,920
statement draft to continue to work on

2377
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,040
on the work that keith and fernando uh

2378
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,639
continue so i'd like to see that work

2379
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,040
continue even if it's in gen dispatch

2380
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,880
for further development but i'm happy if

2381
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,800
it goes to another list and

2382
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,320
that would be fine with me too but the

2383
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,400
analysis aspect has to come along with

2384
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:33,040
this before we take any action

2385
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:37,840
thank you

2386
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,520
thanks elliot richard europe thanks

2387
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,639
um so i i want to plus one what jeffrey

2388
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:45,840
said about learning from what other

2389
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,280
groups are doing here um

2390
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:49,120
i think that uh following the w3's

2391
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,040
example and starting up some sort of

2392
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:51,920
group where we can have these

2393
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,760
discussions is really important um

2394
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,360
probably a good idea here

2395
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:56,480
obviously i think this is an important

2396
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:58,639
topic to talk about um the reason i got

2397
01:33:58,639 --> 01:33:59,280
in the queue

2398
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,360
was that the notion of a problem

2399
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:02,960
statement

2400
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,719
kind of makes me nervous um because this

2401
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,320
is not like a fixed problem this

2402
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:08,159
problem is not fixed for for all time

2403
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:09,199
it's not really it doesn't really make

2404
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:09,920
sense as

2405
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,120
um you know an rfc to me um and

2406
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,880
i think this is an area where the sort

2407
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,159
of waterfall

2408
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:18,320
style of development that the ietf

2409
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:20,000
sometimes falls into or we do a problem

2410
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,520
statement and some requirements then

2411
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,120
you know many moons down the road we get

2412
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,560
to a solution is

2413
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:26,239
is really antithetical to solving this

2414
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:27,520
problem like i think there's there's

2415
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,040
points of urgent action here

2416
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,320
we should obviously make sure we

2417
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,760
understand what we're doing when we do

2418
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,639
something

2419
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:33,920
but i don't think we need to understand

2420
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:36,480
the entire waterfront of problems before

2421
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:38,580
we take action on specific things

2422
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:41,670
[Music]

2423
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,360
i will agree with that i think the

2424
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,480
purpose of the

2425
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,480
quote problem statement isn't to

2426
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,159
completely define the problem

2427
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:53,119
and then we can go off and fix it uh

2428
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,800
it's more like just to give the

2429
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:55,440
community

2430
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,840
a sense of the breadth of the different

2431
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,920
issues and also a chance to provide

2432
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:00,480
input

2433
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,920
so that we're hearing from lots of

2434
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,719
different people because it's very easy

2435
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:07,119
for a couple of authors or a few people

2436
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:08,000
to say

2437
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,840
oh these are the problems and completely

2438
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,239
ignore other things that other people

2439
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:14,960
are experiencing uh but i don't yeah i

2440
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,400
don't want to do a waterfall stop thing

2441
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:18,080
this has to be an ongoing effort and we

2442
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:18,719
have to

2443
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,000
do what we can when we can

2444
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,199
um kirsty go right ahead

2445
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:31,360
thank you yeah so just to say thank you

2446
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,119
for writing this draft i know that can't

2447
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,000
have been um

2448
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,560
the easiest undertaking so thank you um

2449
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:37,600
i just have a kind of

2450
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,600
philosophical question about to what

2451
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:40,880
extent the ietf

2452
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,280
itself or attendees who currently go can

2453
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,239
really understand

2454
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,440
the uh inclusion issues so we obviously

2455
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:48,960
all feel included to some extent that

2456
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,719
we're able to at least defend and turn

2457
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:51,440
up

2458
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,520
and i don't know if there's a kind of

2459
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,440
question here about how you could reach

2460
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,520
maybe people who came like one time and

2461
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,440
then were like thanks but no way

2462
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,440
um and left because of the inclusion

2463
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,960
issues they faced if there's a way to

2464
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,639
reach out to those people

2465
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,480
um just really aware that we're gonna

2466
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,320
have this self-selecting bias of like

2467
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:10,560
well i attend ietf and i have done for a

2468
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:11,280
while

2469
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,520
and i find the biggest issue like is the

2470
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:14,320
tool

2471
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,560
the tool system and like okay but you're

2472
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:17,600
already here

2473
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,239
so in terms of inclusivity maybe you

2474
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:21,679
know you feel included enough that you

2475
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:23,440
are still able to participate

2476
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:26,159
so um yeah i think elliot said that we

2477
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:28,320
can kind of opine as to what the reason

2478
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:30,800
the main reason we don't have a a vast

2479
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:31,360
um

2480
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,880
diversity in the itfa is why people

2481
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:34,480
don't feel included but obviously we're

2482
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,760
coming at that from

2483
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,480
our perspective and yeah just to kind of

2484
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,400
i guess a question or like a caution

2485
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,920
that you know we can form a

2486
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:43,600
an icf working group to have a good

2487
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,920
think about why people don't come to itf

2488
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,280
but obviously that's

2489
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,199
not the best breadth of representation

2490
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:50,719
you could get there so

2491
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,719
kind of a yeah for moving forward i

2492
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:53,920
would just like to see some conscious

2493
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,760
effort to reach outside of

2494
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,320
this sdo maybe look in other sdos or

2495
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,400
other technologies or um

2496
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,320
look at the kind of newcomers that never

2497
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,799
came back

2498
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,719
thanks

2499
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:08,880
yeah i would i would really like to find

2500
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,320
some way of

2501
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:14,000
capturing feedback from

2502
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,600
not only people who attended once and

2503
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,920
they didn't come back but people who

2504
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,000
maybe even didn't get that far because

2505
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,840
uh

2506
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,679
um you know if you manage to attend and

2507
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:27,199
participate at all you've

2508
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,920
you've crossed several barriers uh and

2509
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,360
probably

2510
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,119
gained access to resources who could

2511
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:35,679
help you move further but

2512
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,360
we don't we have no idea about the

2513
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,800
people who sort of don't even get that

2514
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,199
far

2515
01:37:39,199 --> 01:37:41,679
and i suspect that's a very underserved

2516
01:37:41,679 --> 01:37:44,320
population

2517
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,400
so i just want to say that we need to

2518
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,800
cut the queue here after daniel

2519
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,320
so that we can continue the presentation

2520
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:54,080
after that go ahead occur

2521
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,719
thank you um yeah i mean so some of what

2522
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,320
other people have said i think

2523
01:37:58,320 --> 01:37:59,360
you know i think it's good to have a

2524
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,639
sort of survey document that kind of

2525
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,639
covers much of the space

2526
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,840
these are issues which i think the

2527
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,840
entire industry is struggling with with

2528
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,520
more or less success in various axes um

2529
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,199
so i think you know it's important here

2530
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,360
to um you know when we figure out things

2531
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:14,480
that we can do

2532
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,080
like find out some find some way to do

2533
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,159
them um so i i definitely in favor of

2534
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:19,760
having some sort of mailing list and you

2535
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,080
use that as a brainstorming um you know

2536
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,800
kind of a

2537
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,000
incubator or a nursery for new ideas and

2538
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,600
then when those ideas become

2539
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,520
uh you know become right for for work as

2540
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,800
the um as a

2541
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,880
as the term work did then we take them

2542
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,639
on and actually give them an itf so

2543
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:37,119
um you know i i i don't think that we're

2544
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,480
not gonna solve like the entire thing in

2545
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,520
one shot um

2546
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,719
so especially in favor of like you know

2547
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:45,280
uh you know i think having a venue where

2548
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:46,480
we can try to like make incremental

2549
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,119
forward progress

2550
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,320
yeah um so uh i want to thank the

2551
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,719
authors of the document this is uh

2552
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:03,760
this is overdue for the ietf and i think

2553
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:04,080
that

2554
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,159
there's a pretty good initial statement

2555
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:08,080
here um i want to point out that the

2556
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,520
comfort zone point

2557
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,760
that they raise um is actually pretty

2558
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,800
critical

2559
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,320
and the organizations that i've been

2560
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,679
part of that have tried to do this kind

2561
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,840
of work

2562
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,159
have struggled a lot internally and i

2563
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:21,679
can't imagine that the ietf would not

2564
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:23,119
also be struggling this is going to be

2565
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:24,880
difficult if we take it seriously

2566
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,719
and if we don't take it seriously it's

2567
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,800
pretty irresponsible

2568
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,159
um to do that difficulty to handle that

2569
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:33,920
difficulty

2570
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,280
particularly for groups that have

2571
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,600
already sort of

2572
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,080
kept out people which i think includes

2573
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,920
the ietf

2574
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,520
we are going to need to think about

2575
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:45,440
bringing in folks outside the ietf to

2576
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:45,920
give us

2577
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,679
actual critiques actually listening to

2578
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:50,239
them and the process of doing that

2579
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:52,880
is not something that is done for free

2580
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,400
if you want to get somebody to come and

2581
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:54,880
give you

2582
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,840
a organizational analysis you often

2583
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,679
legitimately need to pay them for their

2584
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:00,880
time and their effort

2585
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,080
and they're going to you're going to be

2586
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:03,600
paying them to tell you things that you

2587
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,239
don't want to hear about yourself

2588
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:07,600
and so we can talk about trying to do

2589
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:09,520
this ourselves and i

2590
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:10,800
think we should be trying to do it

2591
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,239
ourselves but i don't think we should

2592
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:13,840
only be trying to do it by ourselves and

2593
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,199
we need to we think about how we

2594
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:16,719
allocate resources

2595
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,760
towards um towards addressing these

2596
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,520
problems it's not going to be for free

2597
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,000
and it's not

2598
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:25,679
going to be fun but it is necessary

2599
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,440
just to summarize i mean i'm at least

2600
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,560
hearing a general sense from folks that

2601
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,880
this idea of setting up a mailing list

2602
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,239
either reusing

2603
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:44,000
one that is currently uh stagnant or

2604
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,520
creating a new one um there seems to be

2605
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,199
at least some momentum for that's a good

2606
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,080
idea

2607
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:52,239
and then figure out what structures to

2608
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:55,440
put behind it as we go

2609
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,719
so you know that seems like

2610
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,440
at least a positive step and then i

2611
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,280
think talking to lars about what kind of

2612
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:04,000
structure to put

2613
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,320
around it um since he's going to be the

2614
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:07,040
stuckey

2615
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:10,000
at some level in in all likelihood is

2616
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,880
probably

2617
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,480
a good next step as well i would say in

2618
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:14,880
in

2619
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,000
oh sorry to interrupt let me know okay

2620
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,560
cool i i certainly want to see a mailing

2621
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,679
this discussion but i

2622
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,320
i think in a way it's easy for those to

2623
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,080
get buried and so i think it might be

2624
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,520
useful to have a mailing list

2625
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,719
and also some expectation of having

2626
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,840
additional meetings just maybe to raise

2627
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:34,639
the level

2628
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:37,280
of awareness of this that this effort is

2629
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:38,560
going on

2630
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,199
um and maybe not a long-term commitment

2631
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:42,560
to doing that until we know what the

2632
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,239
structure is but at least maybe at the

2633
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,880
next ietf meeting um

2634
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,920
and again uh lars

2635
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,679
or other ads or whatever can call it

2636
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:54,080
whatever they want but i'd like to see

2637
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:55,440
something to raise the level of

2638
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,199
awareness a

2639
01:41:57,199 --> 01:42:00,560
long drawn-out buff um

2640
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,840
yeah that never ends the buff that never

2641
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:04,480
ends

2642
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,679
um okay uh we'll we'll go back to that

2643
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,400
um so keith did you want to do some of

2644
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:11,199
the uh

2645
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:14,480
solution space stuff um and and then we

2646
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,480
can wrap up from there

2647
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,960
sure so these i would say these are uh

2648
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,000
suggestions

2649
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,600
and uh brainstorming and we

2650
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,520
part of the hope i think is that it will

2651
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,760
solicit other input so if you don't like

2652
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,199
something here and you want to suggest

2653
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,520
something alternative that's awesome

2654
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,880
um basically i would just like to see

2655
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:37,119
a lot of different ideas come forth and

2656
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,400
some of them

2657
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,000
may or may not be workable but don't

2658
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,360
filter them because you think they're

2659
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,560
not

2660
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,320
just try to get some input into the

2661
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,760
process

2662
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:49,280
so uh next slide please uh

2663
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,159
some disclaimers um a lot of these

2664
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:53,040
problems are not

2665
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,639
problems i think that can be fixed by

2666
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,560
publishing rfcs

2667
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,080
again that's kind of the normal thing

2668
01:42:58,080 --> 01:42:59,440
they would do and we might get in a

2669
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,080
habit of sort of doing that

2670
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,760
publishing documenting something that's

2671
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,679
done is great and sometimes you will

2672
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,600
need an rfc

2673
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,679
but sometimes again you might need tools

2674
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:11,280
sometimes you might need organizational

2675
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:13,440
changes sometimes you might need

2676
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,840
just to uh recognize existing efforts

2677
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,639
and work with those to be sort of a to

2678
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:22,080
have them dovetail with things and

2679
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:23,600
sometimes you might need to solicit

2680
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,280
support from elsewhere like i soccer

2681
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,320
anyone else

2682
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,400
for instance that could fund

2683
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,320
participation for people who can't

2684
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,360
uh as easily participate so lots of

2685
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,119
different things

2686
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:38,159
um again as we say we

2687
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:40,080
probably need effort from multiple parts

2688
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,560
of ietf in related groups

2689
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,119
there are some past efforts which i

2690
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:47,520
would like to recognize

2691
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,040
uh and if they're still ongoing uh

2692
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,280
maybe encourage them some some and sort

2693
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,320
of uh

2694
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,800
build some more cooperation uh we will

2695
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,480
need some new efforts also

2696
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,800
uh as i said earlier i think we need a

2697
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,639
commitment to continuous improvement in

2698
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:03,600
this area

2699
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,080
so this is you know it's not a we do

2700
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,440
this once and we're done

2701
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,920
it is a change in the attitude of the

2702
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:10,960
organization

2703
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,679
but i will say that i've always seen

2704
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:14,639
nietf

2705
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:17,360
a genuine desire to openness and i think

2706
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,199
it still exists i think it's

2707
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:20,719
i don't want to say we've been doing it

2708
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,040
all wrong we need to completely change

2709
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,639
things no i think we just need to

2710
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:25,440
continue

2711
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,719
and add to what has been done before

2712
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:32,480
and and continue this uh

2713
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:34,719
high value of openness and realize we

2714
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,159
can do better than we've done

2715
01:44:36,159 --> 01:44:37,520
and conditions have changed and

2716
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,239
sometimes we need to change too

2717
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:43,040
uh and the last problem last point about

2718
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,480
different time scales some things can be

2719
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,239
fixed quickly and some things

2720
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,800
are going to need longer term efforts so

2721
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,600
next slide please

2722
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:55,280
um so this is uh an idea

2723
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:59,520
not the only possible idea but a way to

2724
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,840
promote more diversity in ietf

2725
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,840
groups and leadership roles the

2726
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,320
essentially rotating people through

2727
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,080
working group chairs

2728
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,960
would actually would train more people

2729
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,080
it would make more people

2730
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,639
available for potentially other

2731
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,400
leadership roles

2732
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,080
and uh perhaps also

2733
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,000
a bit more churn within a working group

2734
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,440
and maybe an additional chair within

2735
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:28,719
each working group

2736
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:34,239
would uh give a wider variety of people

2737
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,280
um recourse if they didn't think

2738
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,040
things were being handled properly so

2739
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:41,199
just promote a better sense

2740
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:43,040
of fairness and inclusion than perhaps

2741
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,960
we have now

2742
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,520
next slide

2743
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:51,760
uh the suggestion also is you don't want

2744
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,800
in general if the

2745
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,440
if the sort of appeals chain or process

2746
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,520
chain of a document

2747
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,159
or a working group involves several

2748
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,639
people from the same organization

2749
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:07,119
that could be a barrier if if there are

2750
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:08,480
efforts that

2751
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,480
you know a certain company doesn't see

2752
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,080
is in their interest and wishes to

2753
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,520
discourage

2754
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,800
so um we'd like to see perhaps more

2755
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,719
diversity of

2756
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:21,840
uh the sponsors of different working

2757
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:22,800
group chairs

2758
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:27,199
um and uh some again some rotation of

2759
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:27,840
this

2760
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,840
um next slide

2761
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,679
uh again for iesg it would be nice

2762
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:40,880
if perhaps there was uh and this would

2763
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,000
affect nom-com

2764
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,199
uh but that basically we we sort of you

2765
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:47,199
shouldn't have more than one isg or one

2766
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:48,560
more than one person from the same

2767
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,440
organization on isg at the same time

2768
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,600
uh and this would probably have to be

2769
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,440
sort of gradually phased in rather than

2770
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,440
we're going to kick some people out

2771
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,480
but um but again

2772
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,760
just less opportunity for

2773
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,360
any single company to uh stack the deck

2774
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,719
so to speak um and this the last bullet

2775
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:11,679
here

2776
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:14,639
again if if a working group uh is under

2777
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:15,760
a particular hd

2778
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,920
then they should be from uh different

2779
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,440
companies

2780
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,480
next slide

2781
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,679
uh similar idea for iab members

2782
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:29,119
uh and uh

2783
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:32,159
i guess a gap between

2784
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:35,280
moving from one role to another uh so

2785
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,400
that

2786
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:41,199
maybe there's just more churn next slide

2787
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,119
um this comes from uh i think fernando's

2788
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:49,119
experience in nom-com

2789
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:52,480
where there was a uh strong assumption

2790
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:53,119
that

2791
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:55,280
uh nom-com members needed to show up for

2792
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,119
face-to-face meetings

2793
01:47:57,119 --> 01:48:00,639
and uh there was even a suggestion that

2794
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,639
i think he stepped down because he had a

2795
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,320
hard time doing this

2796
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,199
so uh i think it's a fair point that the

2797
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:09,280
the rules that we have for selecting

2798
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,880
nom-com while they've tried really hard

2799
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,239
to be fair

2800
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:14,480
uh they come from a somewhat different

2801
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:15,760
era and

2802
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,440
uh it's harder for people to attend all

2803
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,600
the meetings now in in some ways than it

2804
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:21,520
was for the participants back at that

2805
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:22,719
time

2806
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:26,480
um so in some ways that's because we're

2807
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:28,080
more diverse and that's a good thing but

2808
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,639
maybe

2809
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:32,080
uh if nom com could adapt to

2810
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:35,920
relying less on face-to-face contact and

2811
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,040
more things online and also the

2812
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,440
suggestion that

2813
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,520
nom-com members should recuse themselves

2814
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,719
from discussion or

2815
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:47,600
of a candidate that's from their own

2816
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:48,480
organization

2817
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,080
i'd like to think that happens already

2818
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:52,320
but maybe that's not the case

2819
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,799
next one

2820
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:59,440
uh fee waiver for face-to-face meetings

2821
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,080
uh

2822
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:03,199
obviously that's gonna require um

2823
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:05,280
well we can understand why that might be

2824
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,560
difficult but

2825
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,679
uh that certainly the the cost of

2826
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:11,360
participating in face-to-face meetings

2827
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,880
is a barrier

2828
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,280
and i think anything that we if we can

2829
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,159
find

2830
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:19,360
sponsors or ways of of uh

2831
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:21,360
providing economic assistance to people

2832
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,639
who have a hard time attending

2833
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,000
face-to-face meetings i think that would

2834
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,960
be a good thing

2835
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,840
and whether that's done by the

2836
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:28,800
organization making things cheaper

2837
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,880
whether that's done by finding

2838
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,119
you know sponsors or scholarships or

2839
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,320
something has been

2840
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,920
done in the past i don't know but i

2841
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,679
think it does need to be

2842
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,599
kind of an ongoing thing and not just

2843
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:41,760
like hey you can attend one meeting and

2844
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,000
that's

2845
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,360
not going to really improve the

2846
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,560
inclusion and diversity in the

2847
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:49,199
organization so

2848
01:49:49,199 --> 01:49:51,678
next slide

2849
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:56,560
so and i guess if we have discussion

2850
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,560
time i guess we're kind of running low

2851
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,599
um i maybe maybe it's better for a

2852
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:02,880
mailing list if it's created or

2853
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,159
something like that but

2854
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:06,000
we we were sort of fernando and i were

2855
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,520
kind of unsure about how to proceed

2856
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,239
because this

2857
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,040
this would be kind of a weird effort and

2858
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:12,880
uh there was a question about

2859
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,719
whether we should just sort of have lots

2860
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:16,159
of standalone proposals

2861
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:18,639
uh for to address different points that

2862
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:19,760
have been identified

2863
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,719
or or what and i don't know that's just

2864
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:23,280
uh

2865
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:26,400
probably a topic for discussion um and

2866
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,520
that i believe

2867
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,480
is the last slide or nearly so let's say

2868
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:32,239
what i have here yes

2869
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:36,000
so uh i'll defer to the chairs but i

2870
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,840
think in some ways we'd like to discuss

2871
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,280
we'd like to have a sense from the

2872
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:42,000
from the group of uh proposals for

2873
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,119
moving forward

2874
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:45,119
uh more more perhaps than brainstorming

2875
01:50:45,119 --> 01:50:46,400
about solutions at this point because

2876
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,360
we're kind of short on time

2877
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:52,800
yeah um i think if you know again

2878
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:55,840
it was sounding to me earlier and and uh

2879
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:56,560
what you

2880
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,239
laid out doesn't um uh go against this

2881
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:02,320
is that there is some momentum for

2882
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,480
let's get a list set up and and start

2883
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:05,599
talking about it there

2884
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:07,760
i think we do have to talk about

2885
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,520
structure of moderation whether

2886
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,119
someone's gonna be the

2887
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:14,159
um chair or some sort to keep

2888
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:17,119
discussions going but um do folks wanna

2889
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:18,719
make any comments on these particular

2890
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:20,080
and like keith said

2891
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,400
it's probably not worth going into you

2892
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,320
know diving into the details of any

2893
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,560
given proposal but

2894
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,080
um any comments on this so far

2895
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:32,400
the the uh jabber room by the way has

2896
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,000
been quite helpful uh

2897
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,480
and and interesting uh as you were

2898
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,159
talking uh definitely worth going back

2899
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:39,119
and taking a look at

2900
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:41,599
what some people said uh sorry i

2901
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:42,880
couldn't follow it while i was talking

2902
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,239
but yeah

2903
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:46,480
definitely take a look andrew you wanted

2904
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,560
to make a comment

2905
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,239
yeah it was just maybe picking up on the

2906
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:52,239
suggestion pete you made near the start

2907
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:55,280
in terms of uh next steps

2908
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,840
um well firstly i think the points you

2909
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:58,320
covered

2910
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:01,119
um both authors here in the paper and so

2911
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:02,080
on

2912
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,080
were good and i think a good starting

2913
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,199
point a solid

2914
01:52:05,199 --> 01:52:07,119
foundation there's maybe a few things i

2915
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:08,480
would add extra but

2916
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:11,040
we don't need to discuss those here um i

2917
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,199
do wonder whether a good next step

2918
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:15,040
to put more substance to this though

2919
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:17,040
could be uh above

2920
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,400
uh going back to one of the points that

2921
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,719
you suggested at the start uh

2922
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:23,920
pete there's another next step um

2923
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,280
which could be arranged i think quite

2924
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,000
quickly so it needn't delay things

2925
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,080
just to get just to maintain some

2926
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,119
momentum

2927
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:33,360
because just doing something on a list i

2928
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,199
think it would lose a lot

2929
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:38,880
if that's all that happened next

2930
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,320
so that would be my suggestion right

2931
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,000
because a bath doesn't necessarily i

2932
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,520
mean above doesn't necessarily have to

2933
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,159
be working performing it could be

2934
01:52:46,159 --> 01:52:49,119
okay we're trying to figure out the

2935
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:50,719
direction that this stuff is going and

2936
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:51,119
so

2937
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:54,239
maybe calling it a buff um is a way to

2938
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:55,920
continue momentum

2939
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:59,119
yeah um

2940
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:01,920
and it's certainly served again a

2941
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,520
meeting at the next ietf

2942
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,480
so yeah yeah yeah yeah and and then you

2943
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:07,520
know maybe the

2944
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,679
lars can give us some feedback on

2945
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:12,400
different structures we might use or or

2946
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,320
ways to approach this that might work

2947
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,000
out best

2948
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,239
since

2949
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:26,239
anybody else

2950
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:28,080
well i think we have some direction here

2951
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,400
um i think at the very least

2952
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:33,360
um we're saying let's get a mailing this

2953
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:34,480
set up

2954
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:37,760
and then i think um

2955
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,960
you know uh once we get that mailing

2956
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:42,560
list set up let's at least start the

2957
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,000
conversation

2958
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,440
um by having lars who by tomorrow will

2959
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:48,320
be our

2960
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,840
new ad sort of step in there um

2961
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,719
and say okay you know start the

2962
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:56,080
discussion of how we should structure

2963
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:57,119
this

2964
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:00,320
um i i think i'm hearing um

2965
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,400
a good deal of support for going forward

2966
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:03,520
with something

2967
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,760
um but people aren't really sure what

2968
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,199
that something would look like in the

2969
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:08,400
end

2970
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,239
um does anybody disagree with that

2971
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:11,520
assessment

2972
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:13,280
sounds like having a venue to continue

2973
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,599
the discussion not only a mailing list

2974
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:16,080
but

2975
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:19,199
like an actual meeting is a good idea

2976
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:23,839
yeah yeah yeah

2977
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:26,639
um and yeah to alyssa's question why not

2978
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:28,800
use the existing list i i think that's

2979
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,920
um not a problem um

2980
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:34,639
i think uh and keith can correct me if

2981
01:54:34,639 --> 01:54:35,520
i'm wrong but

2982
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,280
i think the only concern was that that

2983
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,840
had sort of a a charter of its own at

2984
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:41,920
some point and we wouldn't want to

2985
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:44,480
conflate it with that but beyond that if

2986
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,840
there's an existing list and

2987
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,800
and um you know we want to use that i

2988
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:51,199
think it's perfectly reasonable

2989
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,639
yeah i don't know i'd like to look at

2990
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,639
the list charter just to refresh my

2991
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:56,159
memory of it uh

2992
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:59,280
and um sometimes it is good to start

2993
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,239
fresh it's just

2994
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:02,000
psychologically speaking but i don't

2995
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,599
have a strong opinion about it at this

2996
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,040
point

2997
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:07,920
yeah alyssa go ahead

2998
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,320
the description of what the list is for

2999
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:11,840
can be changed

3000
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,360
so it's not like it's set in stone

3001
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,040
whatever whatever it says there that's

3002

3019
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:01,840
done hasn't always been easy

3020
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:03,760
and um you know this is kind of an

3021
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:04,880
experiment with

3022
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,320
bringing the dispatch model to the

3023
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:09,199
general area so i'm really thankful for

3024
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:12,320
all of your efforts and um

3025
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,880
lars do you want to talk about who we're

3026
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,280
bringing on

3027
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,440
i can it'll be pretty quick uh in the

3028
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,040
sense that as you can imagine

3029
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,719
the handover procedure thanks to cove it

3030
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:24,080
hasn't been quite so

3031
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,239
uh great as it has been in previous

3032
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:27,280
years so i'm

3033
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,840
still coming up to date so so for the

3034
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,440
foreseeable future the next couple weeks

3035
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,639
maybe until the next meeting

3036
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:36,159
um continue steady as you go um

3037
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:38,400
i'll keep a closer eye on what's going

3038
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,480
on um and i think sort of we're gonna

3039
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:42,480
have a discussion then uh with pete and

3040
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:43,280
kirsty about

3041
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,920
what we're going to do uh going forward

3042
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:47,440
with some of these larger topics right

3043
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,560
because it's

3044
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,480
clear that dispatch style isn't really

3045
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,159
suitable for them but but for now this

3046
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:53,360
is what we have and i think that's where

3047
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,159
the discussion

3048
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:57,839
has been happening and should continue

3049
01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:04,239
and big thanks to kirsty for um being

3050
