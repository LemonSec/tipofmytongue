1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,200
and welcome to the uh the hackathon

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,600
closing

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,679
hope uh hope you had a good week and

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,239
uh we have uh thanks to all you for

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,359
joining i see we have a good list of uh

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
presentations lined up i want to wait

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,760
just a couple minutes for those people

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,840
who are still joining

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:11,659
[Music]

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
so

11
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
while we are waiting for people to join

12
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,799
i want to uh

13
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,720
just cover a couple things that i'll

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,479
cover again at the end

15
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
but i figured uh you know some of you

16
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,920
may not be able to stay for the whole

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,759
time although i hope you can

18
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
so let me just uh briefly share this

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,360
first of all there is a

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,200
survey um for the hackathon

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
it it the link has been added to the

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,680
wiki so if you go to the hackathon wiki

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
uh you'll find it but i also put it here

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,280
in the slides and i've

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
uploaded these um to github so you can

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
grab them from there as well

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
then the other thing i wanted to mention

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,239
is a draft

29
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
um and actually uh

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
uh first shared this and had it

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
discussed at the last ietf meeting

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,080
and there's been some updates to it now

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,599
and it'll be discussed again in the uh

34
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,160
working group and it's basically

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,840
covering the hackathon

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
how it works uh kind of as a

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,519
from a process perspective just to

38
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,400
capture

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,920
you know this is how we run the

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,840
hackathon and why we do things the way

41
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
we do

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,040
and also part of the thing the reason

43
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
why

44
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
it was created was and the whole schmoon

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,519
working group

46
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,660
has to do with um

47
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,440
[Music]

48
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,000
uh you know dealing with meeting online

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,879
as we are now

50
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,400
both for the itf meeting for the

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,239
hackathon and so

52
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,920
the draft isn't specific to that it

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,319
really covers the hackathon overall

54
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,120
but um also aspects that are either new

55
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,239
or different

56
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,120
when you're running it online so i would

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,000
appreciate

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,560
uh if folks here while everything's

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,920
still very fresh in your mind if you

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
could take a look at that

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,120
it's it's not very long it's maybe you

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,959
know 10 pages or something like that

63
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
with a lot of

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
kind of boilerplate stuff so it's a

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,519
pretty quick read

66
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,440
and if you have any thoughts i'd love to

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,120
hear them on the list

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
a pull request uh it is on github

69
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,120
there's there's the link you'll find

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,760
that at the

71
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,518
on the data tracker

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,680
and with that i think i will go back to

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:47,440
the start and we will get started here

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
okay so um just a reminder

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
some people maybe didn't attend the

76
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,720
beginning but i think it's always good

77
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,519
to

78
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,439
uh you know attend the kickoff i think

79
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,040
it's always good to just recap why we're

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
here and that's really

81
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,120
uh you know for the hackathon the whole

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
idea is to advance the pace and

83
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,599
relevance of

84
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,879
of ihf standards um

85
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
to really bring together the that spirit

86
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
of collaboration that we get with the

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
open source community

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
and uh and work on code that's related

89
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,959
to the things we either have

90
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
standardized or in the process of

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,440
standardizing or have some ideas about

92
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,360
you know anything really related to ietf

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,639
standards

94
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,759
and uh the goals of that are both to

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,919
you know make the standards better right

96
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,840
because we're getting feedback from

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
actually having uh coded things but also

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,280
just to attract

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,600
developers and new people into ietf and

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,320
to

101
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
take some of the stuff that you know to

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,520
progress

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,240
really from just uh the specification

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,280
which is great

105
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
to if you actually have some code that

106
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
can help you get started

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
uh with implementing or adding support

108
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,040
for the draft or with testing things

109
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,800
about you know a protocol

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,080
that's all great too so those are the

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,280
the big drivers for the hackathon i want

112
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,199
to remind everyone of the note well

113
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,400
we talked about this in the opening that

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
the code you work on is governed by

115
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
whatever the license is of that code

116
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,800
hopefully it's open source code that

117
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,400
makes it easier for everyone to

118
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,199
collaborate and share but anyways the

119
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,720
you have to look at the license and the

120
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,479
rules and restrictions there regarding

121
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,360
the code

122
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,199
but when it comes to the presentations

123
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,720
that we'll all be enjoying

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,280
during the closing those are you know

125
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,840
your

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
your normal ietf contributions and fall

127
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,759
under the note well

128
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,080
okay the agenda so we have two hours i

129
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,440
don't think we'll need the full

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
two hours but based on the number of

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,199
presentations

132
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,680
uh my guess is we'll take a bit more

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,360
than uh one hour

134
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
so you know one hour plus we'll

135
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,120
definitely finish before

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,080
the end of the two hours and we'll have

137
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,360
some time for discussion

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,400
at the end and

139
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
the way it's going to work is we're

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
basically going to run through

141
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
the list of projects in the results uh

142
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
presentation schedule

143
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,759
and this is on the wiki if you want to

144
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,520
take a look at it i might have a

145
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,560
slightly dated version here

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
but it's pretty close i just grabbed

147
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
this maybe an hour ago

148
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,080
and the plan is to just run through an

149
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
order uh we'll start at the top

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,280
we'll work through them if anyone's um

151
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,360
not able to present during their slot

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,680
we'll try to go back again at the end

153
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
or if someone knows in advance that they

154
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
have a timing issue and need to present

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,000
in a different

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
order we can do that too but you know

157
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
this is just to make it a little bit

158
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
easier for everyone to to know when to

159
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
expect to hear something

160
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
or when to talk and and the idea is that

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,199
each of you can drive your own

162
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,319
presentation

163
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,720
so when your slots coming up if you can

164
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
put yourself in the queue and then share

165
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,960
your screen show your audio

166
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,720
share your video that would be fantastic

167
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,240
and if you run into any problems with

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,840
that i'm here to help you along

169
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,199
barry's here and uh alessandra i see is

170
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,759
here

171
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
uh from me techo so we should have all

172
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,039
our

173
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,479
support that we need to run this

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,960
smoothly

175
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,759
just a quick reminder here the the

176
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
presentations as we mentioned before

177
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,360
the ideas these should be quick

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,199
presentations short presentations just

179
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,960
covering some highlights

180
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,560
uh kind of up level to um present what's

181
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,360
real

182
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,560
you know relevant to the ietf community

183
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,720
even to folks who aren't deeply involved

184
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
in the technology you're working on

185
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
the idea that you can this is just to

186
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,199
give people an introduction to what you

187
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,840
did

188
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,879
and share some of the highlights and uh

189
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,240
and then you know people can always

190
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
reach out to you for those more detailed

191
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
discussions

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
but you know we like to focus on not

193
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,759
only like what we actually what worked

194
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,840
but just what did we learn in general

195
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
and especially feedback that you're

196
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,680
going to bring into your working group

197
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
that may help with the work that you're

198
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
the working group's doing on various

199
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,879
drafts and standards

200
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,440
and then also it's nice to see when you

201
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
worked with some open source code or

202
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
with people from an open source

203
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,039
community

204
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,280
or from another sdo because what we

205
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
found is that

206
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,479
code is actually a great way to

207
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,199
collaborate across the the typical ietf

208
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,599
sort of boundaries of a draft and a

209
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,479
small community

210
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,960
it's a way of expanding uh the scope

211
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
there because

212
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,599
we know there's a lot of great code all

213
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,360
over the place that isn't just

214
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
relevant to the ietf community it's

215
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,279
relevant to other communities as well

216
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,958
so this is a great way to engage with

217
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,320
them and we like to just

218
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,599
you know be aware of that that's

219
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,080
happening

220
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,760
okay all of the projects should be

221
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
uploaded to

222
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
this repo in the ietf github

223
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
uh if if you haven't uploaded yet that's

224
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
okay you can

225
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
present just you know the version that

226
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,480
you have on your laptop that's fine

227
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
but just you know afterwards please go

228
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
ahead and make sure it's been uploaded

229
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,680
and if you've already uploaded it that's

230
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,480
ideal

231
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
because that way people can follow

232
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
follow along with your presentation if

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,480
they want to

234
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
so um this

235
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
repo will remain open after the

236
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
hackathon closing

237
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,560
is done and so you know if you find

238
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,279
things

239
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,120
if you continue to work on your code the

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
next few days whatever

241
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
that's great you can update your

242
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
presentation to capture that

243
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,240
okay so with that uh we're going to get

244
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
started on the

245
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
the presentations um this again is a

246
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,519
snapshot

247
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,760
i'm going to pull up the actual list and

248
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,839
go off of that what's on the wiki but it

249
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,680
should be quite close

250
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,440
and any questions before we

251
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,760
begin

252
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,959
okay uh so why don't we get started then

253
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,120
uh application aware

254
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,839
uh gsr v6 networking

255
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,040
hello hello yeah

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
yep i can can hear you and let me stop

257
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,519
sharing so you should be able to

258
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,600
share your screen you see your video

259
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,839
don't see your screen yet

260
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
okay great

261
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,120
how to share uh

262
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,640
you should i've just granted you

263
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
that so you should see something and pop

264
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
up asking me

265
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
when you see my okay can you see my

266
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,279
screen

267
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,959
yep looks good okay thanks charles

268
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,680
uh hello everyone my name is jaiway mao

269
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,839
i'm glad to introduce our project for

270
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,640
you

271
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
it is application aware gsrv6 networking

272
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
our plan is to develop gsrv6

273
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,519
on the linux kernel and combine gsrv6

274
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,200
with apn6 here are some related iutf

275
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,760
drafts

276
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
for your reference and we have built up

277
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,279
some open

278
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,800
communities for you now let's talk about

279
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,880
gsrv6 first

280
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,160
as we know srv6 is the latest routing

281
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,279
technology nowadays

282
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,839
gsrv6 can resolve a critical problem

283
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,279
of srv6 the transmission overhead

284
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,200
of srv6 is too high for example

285
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
if you want to use a streaked te tunnel

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,720
with 10

287
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,040
seeds the seeds will occupy 160 bytes

288
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,360
in your packets that is not accepted in

289
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,440
interactive control and iot scenarios

290
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
which package length is under 128 bytes

291
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,800
so how about gsr v6 the key point is

292
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,279
gsrv6 can reduce 75 percent

293
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,000
transmission overhead that means the

294
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,519
size of seed list

295
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,440
is cut down moreover gsrp6

296
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,200
can reuse the locators of srv6

297
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,880
that means if you want to deploy gsrv6

298
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,440
you don't need to apply for new ipv6

299
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,800
address blocks

300
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
and advertise new ipv6 routes into your

301
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,519
network

302
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,720
so you can deploy gsrv6

303
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,000
incrementally and on your demand it is

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,399
full

305
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,519
compatible with srv6

306
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
by the way there are above 12 vendors

307
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,839
their devices have passed

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,600
test of gsrv6

309
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,040
next let's have a look at apn6

310
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,240
avn6 allows devices to identify

311
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,279
application related information and use

312
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,399
ipv6 extension headers to convey

313
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,720
the information along the packet to

314
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
traverse the network

315
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,920
the information contains app id sla

316
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,639
level

317
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,160
bandwidth delay requirements and so on

318
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,040
so network can quickly adapt to specific

319
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,560
sla requirements

320
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,600
of different applications okay based on

321
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,920
gsrv6 and

322
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,480
apn 6 we present application aware

323
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,200
gsrv6 networking it combines

324
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,040
their advantages to enable

325
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,519
application-aware

326
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,399
fine-grained strict te with lower

327
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
transmission overhead

328
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,160
in this hexane we implement a demo for

329
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,800
each

330
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,079
based on linux kernel and huawei router

331
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
in detail for gsr v6 we build a kernel

332
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,920
module to

333
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,440
identify apn 6 information and select

334
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,160
the most

335
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,760
suitable gsr v6 te tunnel for specific

336
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
application flows after that

337
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,160
you can encapsulate gsrv6 routing header

338
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,399
to packets

339
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,440
for apn 6 we developed we developed

340
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
some functions to encapsulate apn 6

341
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,120
options with application specific

342
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,160
information

343
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,720
in ipv6 hall by hub options header

344
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,600
we set up a three layer topology for

345
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
this demo

346
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
and we tested the performance between

347
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,320
srv6

348
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
and gsiv6 in this demo

349
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,800
we programmed three te pass for

350
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
three kinds of applications all of the

351
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,560
paths

352
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,320
are with above 10 hops that means

353
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
there are above 10 seats in the seed

354
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,639
list

355
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,240
the three applications are first file

356
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,360
downloading

357
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,760
with security tracking in a service

358
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
function chain

359
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,639
second interactive control which is

360
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,680
using

361
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
leave and short messages third

362
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,320
high definition video on demand

363
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
for the result of performance test we

364
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,600
can see

365
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,959
first forwarding rate of gsr v6

366
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,519
is 55 higher than srv6

367
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,320
second for the interactive control

368
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
scenario

369
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
which package contains only about 128

370
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
bytes in the payload

371
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,600
the transmission overhead is reduced by

372
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,120
50 percent third we can see

373
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,959
the bandwidth utilization of gsr v6

374
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,519
is 10 higher than srv6

375
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,639
finally for this hexane activity we can

376
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,079
bring some feedback to

377
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,120
working group the most important is

378
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,399
gsrp6 can improve the utilization

379
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,240
and value of bandwidth significantly

380
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,959
and guarantee sla better for

381
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,360
applications

382
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,759
by the way we have made some future

383
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,880
plans

384
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,240
we plan to make some pog tests in wider

385
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,560
aerial networks such as cine in china

386
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
and you are welcome to join us to

387
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
improve this demo together

388
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
okay here are my teammates if you have

389
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,880
interest

390
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
for our project please send us an email

391
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
thanks for your listening and thanks to

392
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
my teammates thank you

393
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
okay well great presentation yeah thanks

394
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,959
for getting us off to a good start

395
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,720
does anyone have any questions before we

396
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,839
move on to the next presentation

397
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,440
okay well great thank you very much

398
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,720
and thank you thank you very much

399
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,199
we'll move on to network telemetry

400
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
thomas

401
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,520
can you see my screen uh yes

402
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,120
looks good perfect excellent

403
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,480
so uh yeah i'm representing bmp

404
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
and uh young push from the grow and net

405
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
conf

406
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
working group so uh here

407
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,200
uh our plan on our hackathon plan

408
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,559
is uh we are

409
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
on the bmp side we were focusing on

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
on performance so basically we are

411
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,120
interested

412
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,720
just one uh if i could interrupt you

413
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,640
quickly at least on my side as

414
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,760
uh pop up on top of your the title of

415
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
the screen

416
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
about sharing maybe just minimize that

417
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,039
or move it yeah that'd be great

418
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,559
thanks sure i think let's put it

419
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,720
somewhere else yeah

420
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,400
okay great thanks a lot so

421
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,520
on the bmp side our focus is basically

422
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,240
uh we want to understand what is the

423
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
impact

424
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,039
of bmp onto the bgp process

425
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,320
especially if uh jason silip in

426
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,919
out with local vip and path marking is

427
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,360
enabled

428
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,360
onto cpu and memory consumption

429
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,240
on the other hand uh one of the

430
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,919
interesting part of

431
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,280
bmp is that you can get an exact copy

432
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,720
of the bgp rip state and we want to

433
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,440
understand

434
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,559
here uh if when

435
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,919
b bgp congestion is here

436
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,960
uh if under all circumstances

437
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
we can rely that there is no loss

438
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,080
present and on the other hand when bmp

439
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,200
is enabled

440
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,440
we will also understand what kind of

441
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
impact it has

442
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,240
on the bgp route propagation

443
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,520
so that's about the bmp part

444
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,760
so on yang push

445
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,919
there basically we're working on an open

446
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,919
source implementation

447
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,640
of udp node event distributed

448
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,559
distributed notif

449
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,080
so we have a data collection implement

450
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,880
data collection implementation and also

451
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,600
a mockup

452
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,960
publisher and we are we were

453
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,160
integrating it into the pmacct open

454
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,440
source

455
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,559
network data collection uh

456
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,880
in this hackathon we were also focusing

457
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,159
here on

458
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,840
testing the efficiency and the

459
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
throughput uh

460
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,520
on on udp notif uh

461
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,919
the main focus on udp notif is that

462
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,640
basically yang push can be implemented

463
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,039
directly on line cards on the network

464
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,480
processors

465
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,600
so here important for us is that we can

466
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,400
maximize uh efficiency and throughput

467
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
this is the software we are used in this

468
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,140
hackathon

469
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,960
[Music]

470
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
this the network so here on the very

471
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,840
left hand side

472
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,240
this is basically where we are ingesting

473
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,280
the bgp

474
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,720
vpn v4 unicast routes

475
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
uh these two routers are basically route

476
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,039
reflectors

477
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,240
and on the very right hand side this is

478
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,720
the

479
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,080
provided edge routers and these little

480
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,640
boxes in here show basically

481
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,080
uh the bmp coverage so

482
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,159
what we are exposing towards the

483
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,159
data collection which is in here

484
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,039
so on the lab environment side uh i mean

485
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,960
this is not the first time we were

486
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,200
participating the the idf hackathon

487
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,640
so we are from each academe steadily

488
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,360
uh improving so in this time we were

489
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,480
focusing on test ultimate

490
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,720
automatization so we are

491
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,760
in basically generating uh

492
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,240
sequenced pgp vpne for unicast routes

493
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,880
uh we are basically before we are

494
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,919
starting test

495
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,520
initializing the bmp state

496
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,159
collecting then the bmp metrics from the

497
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,799
network

498
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,120
to see to detect any loss or delay

499
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,000
and with young push we are measuring the

500
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,600
impact on cpu on

501
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,600
memory onto the bgp process

502
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,960
so here this time focus was on bmp

503
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,400
route monitoring where we wanna

504
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,360
which we wanna use to detect any loss of

505
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,000
metrics

506
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,120
and also delay into the bgp

507
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,760
propagation now

508
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,200
we are the next step where we want to

509
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,000
improve in this test that we use this

510
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,720
time

511
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
uh we were focusing on huawei vrp

512
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
we have also is6r and tuning patchunos

513
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,480
in the testbed

514
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
present but because of the time

515
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,679
restriction we were not able to use it

516
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,600
so in the next

517
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,159
itf hackathon the next step is also do

518
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,679
interoperability tests among vendors

519
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,440
and since timestamps are important

520
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
on detecting delay

521
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,559
here we saw some improvements we'd like

522
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,240
to add in the next testbed

523
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,799
on the yangpush site and we were

524
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,400
focusing

525
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
on the implementation on the udp notif

526
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,960
here uh we have an implementation now

527
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,000
open sourced

528
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,919
in c it's supporting the segmentation

529
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,840
option and it's in integrated into pmact

530
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,080
it will be soon after the weekend

531
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
available on github

532
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,919
below the github link

533
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,960
and we are working now since several

534
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,039
months towards this goal so this is

535
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,640
basically the first

536
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
udp notif message which we captured

537
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,320
during the itf hackathon in a kafka

538
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
json message so this

539
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,679
was like like a like a child's birth

540
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,240
moment for us that we finally reached

541
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
this goal

542
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,480
from a throughput point of view

543
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,080
in udp notif uh to be honest this was

544
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,720
like

545
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,400
uh really a big thing

546
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,760
uh for us uh because one of our

547
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,120
big aim was to bring performance and

548
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,159
scale into

549
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,679
uh young push so in this test setup

550
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,840
uh we had one

551
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,559
uh we were focusing on one core and we

552
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,840
want to understand

553
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,520
how many um basically how much

554
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,279
how many megabits with 500 000 messages

555
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,080
we can bring through and depending on

556
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,440
the message size we were able to

557
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,159
to to get a throughput between 400

558
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,559
megabits and 11.5 gigabits per seconds

559
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,120
and to be honest compared to what we

560
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,080
have today

561
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,320
in our networks uh with grpc this is a

562
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,520
huge difference

563
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,600
and i think this is a game changer

564
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,000
now back on on bmp

565
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,760
uh so on our test cases we were focusing

566
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,520
on the route reflectors and provider

567
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,720
edge routers

568
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,480
were json cited in pre-policy localhip

569
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,840
and adjacency outpost policy was enabled

570
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,400
with path marking support

571
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,520
and one of the key findings was

572
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,640
on the stress conditions basically

573
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
that the cpu increased after

574
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,200
the bgp was converged so

575
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,840
and for the memory part there was a

576
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,559
slight

577
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,799
overall increase throughout the test

578
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
cases and i will show

579
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
some graphs afterwards

580
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,120
and what was

581
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,440
pretty impressing and was also a big

582
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,440
surprise is even on the

583
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
stress condition uh the outbound bmp

584
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,480
monitoring was always uh be

585
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,360
very consistent so at the end of the

586
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,720
test cases

587
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,000
the state mirrored with bmp

588
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,120
and the state on the routers were always

589
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,919
matching

590
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,440
so we did not lose any metrics

591
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,960
regarding the pgp propagation delay

592
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,080
uh when bmp is enabled and not enabled

593
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,600
here uh we we found out that basically

594
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,679
that the testbed was not

595
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,960
accurate enough the delay is actually in

596
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,159
a in a very

597
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,440
low sub second area and in order to draw

598
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,039
a final conclusion

599
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,360
uh we need to improve our test bed

600
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,400
here just an example on uh bmp eastern

601
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,559
yeah let's just let you know we are over

602
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,480
time so if you could kind of wrap up

603
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
that'd be great and then we can look at

604
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,600
the results

605
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,159
then this is just basically the the

606
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,919
final results on

607
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,279
on bmp wherever they are

608
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,640
or not disabled and here basically

609
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
you see basically if bmp is flapping or

610
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,480
not

611
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,520
uh there is no impact on it

612
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,640
so the good thing about what uh about

613
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,679
this hackathon was

614
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
it was good well prepared we had a good

615
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,679
test automation

616
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,240
we were thanks to slack and teams very

617
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,679
well connected

618
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
same again as last time we were missing

619
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,960
the beers and cocktails and

620
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,080
thank you for uh all our colleagues who

621
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,678
participated this hackathon

622
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,760
thanks thanks for the presentation um

623
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
hopefully we're getting closer to the

624
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,120
cocktails and beers

625
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,760
i did have one question on the uh the

626
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
time stamps

627
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,360
uh i didn't quite catch this is that uh

628
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
a change that you would also need in the

629
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,200
draft or is that just

630
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,320
your test bed to test what's going on

631
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,000
with the draft

632
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,720
uh know that basically the draft

633
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,640
supports basically timestamps

634
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,679
in seconds and also in milliseconds

635
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,399
but in the vendor implementation it was

636
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,559
not

637
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,840
a q and it was not precise enough to

638
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,200
measure the

639
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,640
delay so we need to improve basically

640
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,600
the vendor implementation

641
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,320
okay so perhaps there may be some of

642
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,159
that could feed back into the draft that

643
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,480
was a recommendation of a reason why

644
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,120
implementations even if you could do

645
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,240
just the seconds

646
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,440
you know like why to use one uh

647
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,600
implement something rather than you know

648
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,200
at a deeper level

649
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,120
i don't know if some guidance could go

650
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,720
back into the draft because

651
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
it obviously wasn't wasn't evident that

652
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,080
those time stamps would be needed at

653
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,840
that grand clarity so

654
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,200
it seems absolutely this is this was one

655
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
of the key findings that

656
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,159
uh in order to measure such a

657
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,960
propagation delay such time stamp in

658
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,200
such final candlelight disease is

659
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,720
does does make a difference

660
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,240
great anyone else with any questions

661
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,000
okay thanks thomas thanks a lot

662
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,640
are you here yang model for network

tester

665
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,440
i don't see uh vladimir

666
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,000
he'd warn me he may be a little bit late

667
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,640
okay

668
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,039
let's uh let's go on to the next one

669
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,960
then and we'll come back to vladimir at

670
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,799
the end

671

uh tom if you're here uh ns3 models

672
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,840
do i see tom

673
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,159
okay uh actually vladimir i can see

[Music]

678
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,840
all right well then we will go on to uh

sebastian

680
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,120
hi can you hear me yes

681
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,399
and you should be able to share your

682
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:05,490
screen now

683
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,579
[Music]

684
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,559
um

685
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,000
i'm just fiddling with the screen share

686
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,159
okay i'm gonna get the right window

687
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:33,840
excuse me

688
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,799
[Music]

689
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,120
okay are you seeing the slide yes

690
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,640
okay uh thank you very much this is my

691
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,760
first ietf

692
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,519
hackathon um it might be a little bit

693
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,480
different from some of the other

694
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,919
projects big bang is a

695
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,039
is a software toolkit that's for

696
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,679
studying collaborative communities in

697
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:00,559
general

698
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,080
and especially standard setting groups

699
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,360
so um what it does it is it ingests

700
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,480
uh email get repositories

701
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,200
it ingests stuff from the iutep ietf

702
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,840
data tracker

703
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,480
as of this hackathon it ingests uh

704
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,720
listserv data which some other standard

705
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
settings groups use as a

706
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,960
communications tool and then it combines

707
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,159
those with

708
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,960
data science tools from you know the

709
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,480
scientific python stack

710
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,039
for entity resolution social network

711
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,440
analysis natural language processing

712
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,399
time series analysis uh we're expecting

713
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:38,960
to

714
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,240
start working with a group that does

715
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,679
information extraction soon

716
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,640
and it's a little bit different from uh

717
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,440
arcos

718
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,640
rfc stats uh which we love and are

719
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
inspired by

720
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,159
because it brings in a wider range of

721
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,000
data sets and supports different kind of

722
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
research questions so the big bang

723
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
research community has both social

724
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,519
scientists that are interested

725
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,720
in uh standardization collaboration

726
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,279
and the ietf in particular and also

727
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,440
computer scientists developing new

728
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,919
kind of data science methods for using

729
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,080
this kind of data

730
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,559
so uh it's got a number of different

731
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,080
groups contributing

732
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,640
article 19 is an ngo there's several

733
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,799
university researchers that are involved

734
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,279
not on this list is some participation

735
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,159
that's very

736
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,440
very vision from the university of

737
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
glasgow we're building

738
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,760
a python interface to the data tracker

739
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,279
and uh for this sprint we saw

740
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,840
a number of new participants uh growing

741
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,080
uh including you know a new user

742
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,799
and um a new software contributor who's

743
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,080
made a lot of

744
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,200
uh very great improvements we

745
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,880
uh did a lot of just sort of basic

746
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,120
maintenance and updating of

747
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,440
sort of the installation procedure to

748
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,640
keep up with changing

749
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,200
underlying dependencies uh we produced

750
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,720
an instructional video

751
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,679
about installation basic usage did some

752
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,719
debugging

753
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,159
um and built in this listserv

754
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,079
sort of scraping tool which we want to

755
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,239
apply later to other organizations like

756
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,960
3gpp

757
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
we also did some more substantive sort

758
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,399
of analysis

759
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:25,918
or even and science with the data um

760
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,800
one about uh one project that nick doty

761
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,679
did was about uh

762
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,599
attendance analysis and there was some

763
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,719
other work about

764
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,719
looking at organizational involvement

765
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,560
via email data

766
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,760
so uh this is from nick doty

767
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,399
this is a plot of uh ietf meeting

768
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,359
attendance by country over time

769
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,359
and what he was interested in uh in

770
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,199
particular was the last three meetings

771
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,159
had been remote

772
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,079
um you can see they've got some of the

773
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,839
red x-axis

774
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,520
tag uh and he was pleased to see that

775
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,320
there was

776
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,960
increased attendance relative to uh

777
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,599
prior

778
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,280
meetings because the meeting was remote

779
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,480
though not quite as high as when at the

780
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,359
peak of ietf attendance which was

781
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,480
i guess around 2004 or so

782
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
but the other thing that he noticed was

783
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
that um you can see say

784
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,800
uh in um let's see meeting 76

785
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,000
or 94 where there's a higher

786
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,200
uh higher percentage of of people

787
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,359
attending from japan that's because of

788
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,440
the location of the meeting so we can

789
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,160
see

790
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,119
swings in the nationality of attendance

791
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,160
based on

792
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
uh the location of the meetings the

793
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,920
remote

794
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,680
meetings um it seemed to lose

795
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,880
that locality effect uh which

796
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,920
i suppose is expected um but

797
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
uh is something to keep in mind i

798
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,280
suppose going forward

799
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,400
the other thing we really dug into in

800
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,160
terms of data analysis was

801
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,240
uh some of the research groups that are

802
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,920
involved in the project are very

803
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,440
interested in which organizations are

804
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:05,760
which

805
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,640
are influential in which working groups

806
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,280
um

807
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,160
and while the there's author stats work

808
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,880
that uh

809
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,400
definitely supports this sort of stuff

810
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,160
it doesn't generalize to other standards

811
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,599
groups that don't have as wonderful

812
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,560
a tool as data tracker so we're trying

813
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:20,880
to

814
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,920
explore this using uh email domains

815
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,320
uh for participation in mailing lists um

816
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,200
so theoretically you could use the email

817
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,960
domains basically everything after the

818
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,000
at sign uh but there are some challenges

819
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,119
there's a lot of people

820
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,960
especially in the itf community that

821
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,520
have personal email domains

822
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,440
and um there's also generic email hosts

823
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,760
like

824
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,040
gmail or gmx which

825
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,480
you know encompass several different

826
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,240
individuals

827
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,160
and we're trying to work out data

828
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,599
cleaning methods to make this

829
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,440
a little more useful we were

830
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,800
experimenting with a kind of

831
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,000
entropy threshold of email

832
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
just on the distribution of email

833
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,599
addresses per domain

834
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,440
and we found this quite effective at

835
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,200
filtering out personal

836
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,280
uh email domains we're still trying to

837
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,800
figure out what to do about these

838
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
generic email hosting

839
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
um issues uh but uh

840
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,000
so far we've been pretty good at

841
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,680
successfully isolating when

842
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,320
an email domain is uh coming from a

843
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
corporation

844
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,160
uh or organization uh as opposed to

845
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,200
representing like an

846
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,880
individual which is what we're kind of

847
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,240
trying to get at

848
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,839
um so for the future we plan to

849
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,480
release some improved documentation uh

850
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,079
hopefully make a containerized

851
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:40,720
environment

852
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,640
so that people could uh interact with

853
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,200
the data through an interactive notebook

854
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,960
as opposed to having to sort of download

855
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,599
and install the whole thing

856
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,599
we want to we've got some plans to

857
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,200
refactor the core code

858
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,800
for better encapsulation and

859
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
we want to develop a kind of

860
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,920
standardized process for looking at

861
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,839
organizational involvement that works

862
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,640
not only on ietf data but also through

863
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,359
gpp

864
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,119
w3c ican etc and we are

865
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,200
looking to work with another group in

866
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,720
the future that specializes in

867
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
olive knowledge graph construction and

868
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,960
we're very excited for that

869
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,880
so you can find out more about the

870
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,720
project on our github

871
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,320
uh page and there's a mailing list there

872
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,040
which um which you know you're happy to

873
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,240
join in and check out and join the

874
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,280
discussion

875
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,839
and that is all thank you

876
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,880
oh great well thank you very much uh

877
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
that's that's some some new information

878
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,000
i look forward to

879
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,839
seeing is that more analysis comes out

880
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,760
of that are you are there plans for

881
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,920
like sharing any of the data that you're

882
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,040
generating in it

883
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,280
i don't know in the ihf plenary or some

884
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,240
other format

885
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,839
it's cool the hackathon community from

886
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,440
the tooling perspective but

887
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,640
a lot of people if you're interested in

888
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,960
the results so that's that's a great

889
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,839
that's a great point

890
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,160
as i said this is my first itf

891
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,520
attendance and i've been working on the

892
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,359
big bang software for some time there's

893
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,880
others in the big bank community that

894
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,359
are

895
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,880
weren't tied yet but i'll bring that up

896
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
with them i think we'd love to present

897
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,480
this

898
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,520
at the plenary cool all right

899
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,800
well thank you

900
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
all right let's go on our next

901
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,839
presentation i see yari you're

902
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,720
you're here i'm here but i was wondering

903
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,440
if i could ask

904
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
still a question on the previous one oh

905
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
sorry sorry yeah

906
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,839
yeah so just uh really great stuff very

907
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:28,640
interesting and

908
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,040
and indeed we should hear it in a more

909
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,200
uh general setting in the itf plenary or

910
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,160
something

911
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,079
i i did have one comment on on this

912
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,079
generic email stuff and and there are

913
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,640
ways

914
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,560
to deal with that one of the things that

915
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,400
worked for author stats

916
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,680
was that you could by hand basically

917
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
list the most important

918
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,240
generic email domains and by hand at

919
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,599
least the

920
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,640
most interesting companies or most you

921
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,599
know

922
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,480
companies that many people work for and

923
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,720
from that you can actually override

924
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,960
the email domain information so you

925
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,160
could actually

926
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,800
analyze a little bit of who that's what

927
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,119
because people sign their

928
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,440
company instantly uh in the in the

929
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,880
documents

930
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,119
with the company um or provide the

931
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,800
company name in the documents

932
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
so that's what that's one way perhaps

933
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,560
that you could consider

934
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,280
that that is awesome and thank you for

935
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,560
your question of course we

936
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,319
um we're paying attention to your work

937
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,599
if there's any way we could

938
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,440
reach out to you and get you know your

939
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,920
list of hand-edited um

940
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,599
email addresses of dreams that would be

941
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,040
incredibly valuable but i think

942
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,000
that's something we're thinking about

943
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,520
doing down the line it's just a lot of

944
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,839
work

945
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,480
yes you could let's let's talk

946
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,119
bye-bye okay

947
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,760
and you're also our next presenter so

948
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,040
yeah so so this team worked on uh

949
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,079
quick measurements and um quick of

950
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,800
course is an

951
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,040
encrypted uh transfer protocol which

952
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,240
means that the

953
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,040
measuring it is is much harder than it

954
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,800
was for say tcp where you could just

955
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,920
look at the x and so forth

956
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,599
the quick standard does have some

957
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,920
features for enabling some

958
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,400
specific or explicit measurements

959
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
whereas the spin bit allows

960
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,839
some things to be measured and

961
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,480
we've built some software in earlier

962
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,040
times

963
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,599
two or three years ago already started

964
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,359
work on something called spindam for

965
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:34,880
instance that

966
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,440
i can look at quick flows and understand

967
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,760
what's right

968
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,119
okay should i see

969
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,560
ah do you really want to share your

970
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,160
screen yes i really want to share my

971
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,480
screen

972
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:03,119
do you see it now

973
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,680
do you see my screen uh i it shows your

974
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,880
arc of the screen but it

975
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,720
says it's all black i don't know if

976
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,520
anyone else sees more than that

977
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,839
no it looks like it's next screen same

978
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,560
here

979
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,280
yeah charles could you perhaps share

980
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,920
instead

981
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,760
just about the problem

982
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,400
yeah i think so let me uh

983
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,839
oh okay

984
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,520
yeah let me pull up your your

985
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,119
presentation i'll download it

986
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,640
hold on maybe i just need to do no

987
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,240
yeah no it doesn't allow me to do it

988
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,839
okay

989
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:12,079
yep just kind of yeah

990
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,359
now i'm seeing a black now yeah perfect

991
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,560
thank you so um we built the software

992
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,599
called spin dump

993
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,480
uh to help analyze some of these uh

994
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,640
encrypted traffic flows of the text

995
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,520
that we can and we've been working on

996
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,960
that and expanding that

997
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,680
uh in various directions in in several

998
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,160
uh

999
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,560
hackathons actually over the last year

1000
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,160
and a half or so

1001
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,960
uh this time it was these people from

1002
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,160
telecom italia

1003
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,200
huawei university of hasselt and

1004
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,960
ericsson who participated there for

1005
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,920
ticker the next slide

1006
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,720
and so we worked basically on

1007
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,079
four things uh this week the first one

1008
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:56,400
is

1009
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,440
like new research on different types of

1010
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,200
measurements that we could do with

1011
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,160
encrypted protocols and there's a

1012
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,040
there's a draft

1013
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,319
and there's an implementation of the

1014
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,040
draft in in spin dump

1015
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,240
integrated into the software you can get

1016
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,200
go take a look at the draft i won't go

1017
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,480
into details of that

1018
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,280
today to save some time i've also worked

1019
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,319
on

1020
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,800
android tooling so the idea is that

1021
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,000
users could

1022
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,960
run this measurement tool on their

1023
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,440
phones

1024
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,800
and provide some measurement data to a

1025
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,079
central point

1026
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,280
instead of having the network do this

1027
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,160
these measurements and one one thing

1028
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,359
that we actually were

1029
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,000
surprised by a little bit in this effort

1030
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,200
was that

1031
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,079
that it's it's quite uh possible to

1032
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,040
measure

1033
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,680
quick flows at least when there is the

1034
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,400
spin but

1035
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,880
spin bit is being used uh but it's quite

1036
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,160
difficult to use

1037
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,599
uh or to observe tcp uh for the reasons

1038
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:58,640
that

1039
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,079
some of these platforms um

1040
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,119
hide some of the uh some of the traffic

1041
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:05,440
from

1042
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,160
from us uh on the phone platforms and so

1043
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,560
forth

1044
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,200
and and it's it's not possible to see

1045
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,720
all packets

1046
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,280
um even with this like packet capture uh

1047
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,240
interfaces or

1048
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,160
alternatively one would need more

1049
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,040
permissions to to see everything but

1050
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,400
um so it's been kind of an interesting

1051
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,720
side effect of this encrypted protocols

1052
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,800
that they actually go through

1053
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,760
everything uh on the uh points and

1054
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,640
internet work

1055
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,800
and and you can see what you can see

1056
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,240
obviously you can't measure everything

1057
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,440
but you can

1058
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,640
you can see the things that were

1059
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,319
designed to be seen uh everywhere

1060
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,800
we also do uh quite a bit of uh sort of

1061
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,920
monthly maintenance of the software so

1062
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,000
we need to update it usually with

1063
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,720
new versions of quick now fortunately

1064
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,720
the quick protocol is being released as

1065
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,920
rfc so the version has been set as one

1066
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,200
and uh

1067
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,079
and that's it uh for the moment at least

1068
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:04,960
but we did

1069
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,760
integrate a few pr's and uh fixed a

1070
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,839
number of issues added some features

1071
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,280
some interrupt testing and one of those

1072
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,319
features that we added

1073
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,599
is is q log and uh q lock is like this

1074
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,680
logging format that is

1075
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,440
supported by many endpoint

1076
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,280
implementations so quick

1077
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,599
it's mostly used initially at least for

1078
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,839
for debugging purposes there's a couple

1079
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,200
of drafts you can go read them

1080
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,040
and we chose to add q logos

1081
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,359
as a possible output format from from

1082
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:38,480
spin dump

1083
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,000
and the idea is basically that you would

1084
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,839
get information from several directions

1085
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:42,960
you'll get it from the host

1086
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,440
implementations you'll get it from

1087
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,760
network tools such as spindom you would

1088
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,520
get it from the server

1089
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,040
implementations and then you can

1090
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,200
put all of this thing uh information

1091
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,640
together and then use tool

1092
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,280
tooling built for q log to to look at

1093
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,079
like

1094
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,280
what is the situation from different uh

1095
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,040
viewpoints

1096
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,079
and uh if you go one step forward it's

1097
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,200
the last slide

1098
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,240
so this is kind of um

1099
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,000
sounds may be complicated but it's quite

1100
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,839
simple uh quilo

1101
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,359
clock q lock is uh

1102
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,880
jason essentially and it consists of a

1103
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,240
basically an array of events client

1104
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,520
events and then there's

1105
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,119
information about the protocols and and

1106
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,119
so forth and what we've been

1107
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,440
able to add there is is measurement

1108
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,720
events

1109
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,040
um and there's various kinds of

1110
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,400
measurements that spin dump

1111
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,119
does this what is shown on the screen is

1112
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,359
just one example

1113
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,160
well that's that's basically it and uh

1114
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,559
uh

1115
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:50,880
looks interesting i think we we are

1116
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,599
going to

1117
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,079
have to stop the coding for a moment and

1118
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,160
think about some of the

1119
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
drafts going forward the class are being

1120
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,359
discussed i think

1121
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,359
tsv wg in the coming week

1122
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,960
by robin um but

1123
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,520
but since they started from this logging

1124
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,040
debugging perspective and not from the

1125
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,640
measurement perspective then building

1126
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,000
those measurements

1127
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,839
capabilities into the formats will

1128
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,280
probably take

1129
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,960
a little bit of effort so we sort of

1130
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,880
identified

1131
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,040
opportunities for improving the drafts

1132
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,160
or writing the awards perhaps

1133
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,720
so that's it

1134
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,079
great thank you you know one question i

1135
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,599
had

1136
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,079
so you can identify that the flows are

1137
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,640
quick

1138
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,920
and within the quick flow can you

1139
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,280
identify kind of

1140
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,240
sub flows within it like or is it just

1141
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,400
that this traffic is quick or

1142
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,960
you you can identify a particular quick

1143
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,760
connection

1144
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
or a pair of connections uh going

1145
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,880
between two

1146
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,480
parties and but like what uh in subflows

1147
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,359
or

1148
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,400
or streams are inside one quick flow you

1149
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,440
cannot see and that's

1150
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,200
that's by design of course you can see

1151
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,000
what what the encrypted traffic is being

1152
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,359
fixed okay good

1153
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:11,680
thanks

1154
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,480
uh any other questions

1155
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:31,839
okay great well thanks sharon thank you

1156
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,440
okay let's go to our

1157
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,680
our next presentation i need to get back

1158
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,839
to my list here

1159
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,040
oh it's me

1160
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,359
okay um so uh karsten

1161
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,599
unfortunately couldn't be here as uh no

1162
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,960
one from the uh

1163
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,200
asdf wishy team uh was able to be free

1164
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,319
at this particular time slot so i just

1165
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,240
have a very quick update from them let

1166
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,359
me pull that up

1167
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:27,839
and i'll share it with all of you

1168
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,359
okay

1169
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,640
so uh on behalf of the uh

1170
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,520
asdf wishy team just wanted to give you

1171
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:47,760
a

1172
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,280
a brief update um so this project

1173
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,599
it was it's a joint project between the

1174
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,960
asdf

1175
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,119
group and then the chairs from that

1176
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,079
group running it along with the

1177
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:02,079
tdtrg group um

1178
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,240
and that's really where wishy is being

1179
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,480
uh discussed

1180
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,839
and so the goal for them um

1181
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,640
was to validate sdf 1.1 i believe at the

1182
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,640
last hackathon it was 1.0 they were

1183
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,720
working with

1184
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,280
the semantic proxying trying mapping

1185
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,800
files etc

1186
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,079
a link to their github code wiki

1187
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,280
can get more details a rather

1188
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,559
exploratory

1189
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,400
hackathon is how karsten phrased it

1190
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,119
but you know two pieces of code did come

1191
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:36,960
out of that that

1192
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,760
that will aid with model transformation

1193
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,160
so

1194
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,280
the good news is these uh

1195
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,200
the results of the hackathon are already

1196
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,800
expected and planned

1197
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,440
to be discussed in more detail in the

1198
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,000
actual

1199
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,280
working group and research group session

1200
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,119
so i have them listed they're both on

1201
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:57,440
thursday

1202
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,520
so for those of you who are interested

1203
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,720
in hearing more

1204
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,440
that'll be a great opportunity to engage

1205
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,319
with

1206
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,559
those groups and discussions around the

1207
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,520
hackathon

1208
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,200
and what they accomplished and learned

1209
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,880
and with that i think we will go back

1210
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,079
to our next one which uh paul we have a

1211
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,920
couple presentations from you

1212
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,280
and uh great i see you're here

1213
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,319
let me hello this is paul can you hear

1214
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,359
me

1215
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,640
yes i can okay great you should be able

1216
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,240
to share your screen now

1217
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:47,839
okay sure okay

1218
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,680
okay we can see it uh we're on your

1219
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,359
wrap-up slide though

1220
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,359
and now it just switched to presentation

1221
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:09,359
mode which you know may not be the best

1222
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,440
format

1223
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,200
okay yeah so it is great right okay

1224
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,040
yep that's good and then just one more

1225
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,880
thing there is a little pop-up

1226
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,119
near the bottom uh which maybe you can

1227
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,240
just move that

1228
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,160
it's okay oh

1229
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,680
okay what's going okay

1230
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,400
okay can you okay it's good right yeah

1231
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:32,880
so

1232
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,400
uh okay so hello

1233
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,520
uh this is uh i'm poor jung

1234
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,599
from seongyun university

1235
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,480
i will uh share our hackathon project i

1236
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,440
to nsf

1237
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,599
this time so this is our poster

1238
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,960
so this time we want to implement

1239
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,160
itunes f monitoring data model

1240
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,359
and also we want to

1241
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,480
show the approval concept

1242
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,880
of security management automation new

1243
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,920
draft

1244
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,119
so especially this draft proposed

1245
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,920
application interface for delivering um

1246
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,720
feedback

1247
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,000
information from itunes to analyzer to

1248
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,599
security controller so basically

1249
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,800
this is a typical i2 nsf

1250
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,720
framework so this time

1251
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,760
denial of service attacker generate the

1252
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,200
tcp plot traffic to web return

1253
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,599
network security function a and then

1254
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:38,640
analyzer

1255
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,160
collect the data from

1256
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:45,280
nsf a and then using a machine learning

1257
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,359
ml it detect nsfa

1258
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:52,880
is affected by dios attacker

1259
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,720
and then using application interface

1260
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,079
analyze deliver a bit of information

1261
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,280
such as the dos attack

1262
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,960
from somebody else and then

1263
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,440
security control and translate that

1264
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,599
feedback information into new

1265
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,960
security policy and then deliver

1266
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,240
over nsf facing interface and then

1267
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,599
a new descriptive policy is imposed by

1268
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,319
nsf

1269
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,359
a and then it can drop tcp sync messages

1270
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,640
so this is a monitoring data such as

1271
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,079
cpu memory other resources

1272
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,359
are monitored and also

1273
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,119
using the observation of

1274
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,559
tdos attack and then we iterate the

1275
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,079
analyzer can detect

1276
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,119
so this is the information the attacker

1277
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,400
source and this is the frequency of

1278
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,760
tcp um plot

1279
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,359
so basically uh what we got done

1280
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,200
so we implemented the monitoring

1281
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,920
interface and then analyze

1282
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,599
the dos attack also we deliver the pwa

1283
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:08,400
information

1284
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,359
over application interface and then

1285
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,520
security controller

1286
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,960
translate high level security policy

1287
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,839
into

1288
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,760
a lot of very skilled policy and then

1289
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,680
deliver that

1290
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,119
new skill policy over nsf

1291
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,040
phase interface and then nsf using

1292
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,400
firewall and then it can drop the

1293
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,599
tcp flat so what we

1294
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,720
learned this time so we implemented the

1295
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,559
monitoring interface

1296
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,599
and also we recognize monitoring

1297
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,599
packet flows in nsf to detect the dos or

1298
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,960
ddos attack we need to

1299
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,640
flow based traffic monitoring is

1300
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,480
required so this time we

1301
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,720
show the feasibility of application

1302
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,799
interface this is uh

1303
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:05,839
nearly a proposed by itunesf working

1304
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,359
group

1305
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,079
for security management automation so

1306
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:10,880
next step

1307
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,040
we have five items we want to extend

1308
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,319
monitoring young data model monitor

1309
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,359
packet flows

1310
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,240
and also we want to use as pro along

1311
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,520
with the

1312
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,839
itunes monitor interface to observe

1313
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,160
that traffic monitoring also we want to

1314
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,280
improve

1315
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,599
iterative analyzer in terms of machine

1316
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,480
learning

1317
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,760
and also we want to

1318
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,960
update automatically solved function

1319
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,839
chaining of

1320
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,960
nsf corresponding to

1321
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,599
the security policy and also we want to

1322
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,559
enhance

1323
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,880
security policy translator for security

1324
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,839
management

1325
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:55,200
automation now this is our uh

1326
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,960
ito nsf open source project at github

1327
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,640
so this is a new repository for

1328
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,680
at this time so

1329
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,119
this is my team okay so this is a

1330
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,960
collaboration work with the sunshield

1331
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,680
university from professor young kim's

1332
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,319
lab

1333
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,520
and from actually doctor zhang chobak

i have more moji school uh he is an

1341
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,640
intern from liberty university in the

1342
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,000
united states and also i have a

1343
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,799
visitor student gyeongshi kim from

1344
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,559
kyungbung national university

1345
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,079
so we work together with ipwave

1346
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,200
and vmware working with teams so

1347
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,000
those are our sponsors thank you for

1348
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,720
listening

1349
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,160
listening your mi presentation thank you

1350
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,440
any questions or comment

1351
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,079
uh yeah i did have one question on the

1352
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,760
the yang model that you mentioned

1353
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,000
for the uh monitoring is that

1354
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,079
is that an ietf like uh is it the best

1355
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,200
model that's being developed oh this

1356
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,200
one oh there it was okay

1357
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,559
okay okay so yeah yeah and it's in the

1358
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,400
i2 nsf working group

1359
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
yeah this one is i2 and as a working

1360
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,000
group

1361
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,280
so recently a young doctor

1362
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,119
approved this young mother is related

1363
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,799
to the working rash core so currently

1364
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,480
this draft under walking or rust core

1365
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,160
okay okay ah thank you

1366
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,799
okay great

1367
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,640
so okay

1368
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,040
uh charles can i uh move to next

1369
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,400
presentation

1370
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,240
yeah i think so unless uh did anyone

1371
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,680
else have any other questions

1372
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,520
otherwise yeah we'll move to the next

1373
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,079
one i don't see anyone in the queue so

1374
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,520
go ahead

1375
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,240
okay great

1376
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,359
okay this is a if you wave

1377
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,240
a basic protocol project my name is jam

1378
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,640
for zhang i'm from uh skk or sungyeong

1379
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,240
university

1380
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,920
so this is a foster

1381
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,559
but basically uh previously uh we had

1382
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,400
three hackathons the first one

1383
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:46,079
is we demonstrated the ip2006 to packet

1384
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,079
transmission over ocb

1385
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,920
wi-fi modules and also

1386
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,280
the 108 case we implemented simulation

1387
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:57,520
of

1388
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,200
context aware navigation protocol and

1389
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,640
last hackathon 109

1390
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,680
we started the implement context of a

1391
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,520
navigator protocol

1392
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,040
so this time we use the r1

1393
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,720
i1 lobotics robot it

1394
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:19,440
can be controlled manually or autopilot

1395
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,319
mode

1396
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:23,520
so this time he manually controlled next

1397
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,839
time we tried to autopilot mode

1398
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:29,839
so it sport the linux corner in terms of

1399
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,559
real-time linux so it also

1400
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,880
like to be a sport ip wave

1401
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,119
wave stack but still we need to

1402
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,040
implement ipv6

1403
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,119
step stack so this hackathon is based on

1404
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,440
a context of a navigator draft

1405
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,559
so basically contact aware navigation

1406
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:53,760
protocol means

1407
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,039
this is a highway vehicle to

1408
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,079
hit some obstacle you know highway and

1409
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:00,640
then

1410
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,520
it delivers some emergency contacts

1411
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,319
messages to neighbors and then this guy

1412
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,039
and these guys and received this one and

1413
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:10,160
then

1414
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,960
already their exchange using contact

1415
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,079
corporation

1416
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,240
context message having position

1417
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,720
direction speed acceleration

1418
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,839
behavioral drivers this one can be

1419
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,440
spray or a lot of cluster header and

1420
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,720
it can adjust the maneuvers

1421
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,000
of neighbor speakers to avoid extent

1422
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,559
those are our previous components and

1423
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:37,119
the

1424
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,039
internet draft so basically our

1425
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,799
contact over navigation protocol based

1426
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:45,119
on a neighbor discovery message option

1427
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,760
is called the beaker mobility

1428
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,599
information option vmi

1429
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,319
so this is a and the option so we

1430
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:53,280
support the

1431
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,280
corporation context messaging and the

1432
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,240
emergency context message

1433
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,200
so basically we implemented and tested

1434
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,480
using a robot

1435
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,839
r1 a1 uh robotics

1436
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,119
so they exchanged a message ccm

1437
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:12,240
and the ecm but this time we you

1438
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,359
implemented the udp instead of i76

1439
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,319
this hackathon will try to implement

1440
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,039
icmp

1441
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,960
version 6. so we try to extend the

1442
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,240
ubuntu linux corner for nd

1443
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,200
it turns out there is some high

1444
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,480
complexity

1445
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,680
so we just yeah designed

1446
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,039
how to extend the neighbor table

1447
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,079
that is the neighbor cache and also it

1448
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:40,559
has

1449
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,200
entry for neighbor using neighbor

1450
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,160
structure

1451
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,480
so we try to take advantage of the

1452
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,160
current implementation

1453
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,599
and we want to extend the and the option

1454
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,720
so still uh ongoing work uh hopefully uh

1455
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,640
next hackathon we try to

1456
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,680
finish so next step we

1457
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,559
will continue developing and debugging a

1458
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,440
new option

1459
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,400
called the speaker mobility information

1460
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,440
option in linux corner

1461
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,039
and and also we also will export

1462
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,119
context over navigation uh protocol

1463
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,880
based on this

1464
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,319
new option and then we'll test

1465
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,440
this uh ip46 neighbor discovery

1466
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,359
and also we will sport the autopilot

1467
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:31,280
mode of robot cars

1468
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,799
such as cmp contacts

1469
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:36,400
or where navigation protocol max is

1470
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,240
changed such as there is some accident

1471
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,839
over optical ahead of it

1472
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,400
speakers can exchange the message and

1473
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,680
they can avoid

1474
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,720
that obstacle or the collision with each

1475
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,440
other

1476
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,520
so this is a ip wave open source

1477
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,720
project at guitar

1478
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:00,400
also this also uh collaboration work

1479
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,319
with the social university professor

1480
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:02,720
young

1481
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,480
game and my pitch student

1482
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:09,920
vienna me and chris and

1483
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,200
don they are my phd students

1484
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,119
and son from sunshine university and you

1485
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,400
know

1486
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,440
national university in the same way we

1487
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,839
work together with the itunes sf

1488
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,960
and the vm working group teams

1489
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,359
those are our sponsor especially tta

1490
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:30,079
provided

1491
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,440

okay thank you

1501
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,960
yeah yeah thank you okay bye-bye yeah

1502
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,240
okay uh great next presentation

1503
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:18,640
ratson company thomas

1504
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,880
hi charles hi thomas

1505
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,400
yes they want to show screen

1506
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,520
uh

1507
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,240
wait a second presentation

1508
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,920
okay can you see uh yes

1509
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,839
yeah it's uh i mean we're seeing uh

1510
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:50,960
we're not seeing like

1511
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,240
like presentation mode

1512
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,920
but but you know it's okay okay okay

1513
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,559
let me try and see okay so um

1514
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,319
we came here with a verizon project the

1515
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,760
reason project is a

1516
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,920
project we launched uh four or five

1517
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,119
months ago

1518
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,559
with the goal of building a bunch of

1519
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,599
open source packages that can be

1520
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,119
composed into another station

1521
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,559
verification service

1522
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,160
um these packages tend to cover you know

1523
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,000
several different facets of data station

1524
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,079
verification pipeline

1525
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,640
so we have data formats we have apis to

1526
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,960
vacations to

1527
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,680
with each other we have um evaluation of

1528
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,359
the appraisal policy

1529
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,039
uh endorsement and trust anchor

1530
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,280
configuration storage query whatever

1531
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,319
all that stuff um so this is the second

1532
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,319
microphone we do one verizon

1533
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:45,440
and last time itef 109 we

1534
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,240
implemented heat and cost sweet from the

1535
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:48,960
rats and

1536
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,119
second working group and this time

1537
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,039
around we wanted to put together a bunch

1538
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,240
of the components

1539
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,960
we have built into an instance of of the

1540
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,319
rats architecture

1541
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:01,280
and specifically the so-called

1542
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,200
background check model

1543
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,079
and we wanted to do that using a

1544
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,480
specific attestation format

1545
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,400
which is the psa psa attestation token

1546
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,240
and using a specific interaction model

1547
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,760
which is a challenge response

1548
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,640
um and this was one thing we want to

1549
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:19,520
cover the other thing

1550
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,158
we wanted to do was bringing up to speed

1551
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,080
our 8 implementation

1552
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,399
uh with with the latest version of the

1553
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,198
working group

1554
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:29,120
draft and this was very important to us

1555
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,479
because uh

1556
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,120
the latest version contains a new claim

1557
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,120
that is critical to our workflow and we

1558
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,719
wanted to play with it a bit and see if

1559
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:37,359
it worked

1560
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,679
right so

1561
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,279
the thing so worked on uh

1562
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:47,439
four drafts uh three working group

1563
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:49,520
crafts

1564
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,679
and one individual draft which is the

1565
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:52,960
draft strategic

1566
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,319
uh psa token which we want to

1567
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:00,159
progress through the independent stream

1568
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,759
and what did we do

1569
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,359
we did a considerable amount of

1570
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,759
development and integration

1571
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,960
in four different packages

1572
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,239
of the verizon project

1573
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:19,279
and apart from that we spent a lot of

1574
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:19,679
time

1575
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:22,158
discussing new ideas about uh you know

1576
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:22,799
uh

1577
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,920
missing um tools and

1578
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,158
and and stuff like that or evolution of

1579
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,080
the api implementation

1580
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:34,319
uh to cover other um scenarios uh

1581
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,040
we have you know pr's uh that have been

1582
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,479
merged we have issues that have been

1583
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:38,960
opened

1584
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,839
and all that stuff uh wherever demo

1585
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,198
we've put together a demo based on

1586
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:43,920
docker

1587
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,679
that you could run if you wanted to and

1588
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:46,510
it's there

1589
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:47,679
[Music]

1590
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,640
at that url at the bottom of the page

1591
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,600
and we did

1592
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,759
not do any interrupt for now but we

1593
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:54,800
chatted with another

1594
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,640
uh it's stack to to decide the sort of

1595
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,679
inter

1596
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,400
test which we wanted to perform and and

1597
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,640
we agreed with them to to schedule a

1598
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,520
an interrupt test uh soon maybe a

1599
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,239
virtual one

1600
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,920
instead of waiting for the next cycle

1601
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,679
but um

1602
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,280
um what we learned is

1603
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,080
um as i said we wanted to have this

1604
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,960
profile claim

1605
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,679
implemented and we did it uh thanks to

1606
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,199
yogesh

1607
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:25,360
and uh and that was very interesting

1608
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,280
because we realized while doing that

1609
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,480
that the spec

1610
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,280
as it as it stands is not a hundred

1611
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,640
percent correct and

1612
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,000
uh we need to have more precision around

1613
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,040
uh interesting bits of it and

1614
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,880
so there's a there's a new issue that

1615
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,400
has been raised um

1616
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,920
and there's some discussion already

1617
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,440
ongoing and

1618
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,880
and i think that this would be

1619
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,239
a will be in fact uh some kind of

1620
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,080
feedback that needs to be taken into the

1621
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,239
youtube discussion next week

1622
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:00,560
to wrap up yeah the team members is uh

1623
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,400
jokers myself in sergey

1624
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,080
and yogesh was a first timer and i

1625
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,880
think he enjoyed it very very much as we

1626
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:09,840
did

1627
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,840
that's it thank you

1628
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:20,000
okay well great glad you found that uh

1629
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,199
issue in the draft

1630
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:25,280
now rather than afterwards yes

1631
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,000
exactly what we want to do so all right

1632
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,480
i'll talk to the team for that

1633
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,159
uh any anyone with questions

1634
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,400
okay well thanks thomas uh cheers

uh kj if you can request to share your

1642
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,759
your screen will do that

1643
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,080
okay

1644

can you hear me yes we can see you too

1645
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,800
but not your screen yet

1646
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:35,760
ah okay you should see uh requests now

1647
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:36,960
allowing you to uh

1648
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:51,840
to share

1649
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,679
oh my screen sharing is

1650
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,440
not working so could you pop up to my

1651
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,919
slides

1652
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:33,840
yeah let me uh let me do that

1653
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,960
all right i'm just looking for the uh

1654
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,840
the right one here

1655
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,350
i will not open that

1656
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,459
[Music]

1657
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,719
okay and bng let me find it

1658
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,920
okay i got it

1659
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:29,840
okay thank you

1660
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,080
okay now i can see okay

1661
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:46,000
great yes so this is

1662
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,360
yeah so can i start yes go ahead

1663
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,920
okay so this is the about the bmwg

1664
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,840
considerations for benchmarking network

1665
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,440
performance in the containerized

1666
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,679
infrastructure

1667
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:04,960
so this is our the third hackathon

1668
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,120
and please go to the next slide please

1669
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,560
yeah so the main goal of this hackathon

1670
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,120
is

1671
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:17,040
to figure out the container talking

1672
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,640
performance impact

1673
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,159
by the various resource options so based

1674
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:22,960
on

1675
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,520
our draft so we set up two main features

1676
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,920
the first is implementing containerized

1677
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,679
infrastructure with the

1678
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,040
various network models and second is

1679
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,040
verifying performance impact depending

1680
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,080
on the

1681
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,040
various configuration settings next

1682
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,600
slide please

1683
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,239
yeah uh so the last two

1684
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:53,120
are the hackathon so we set up the

1685
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:53,840
environment

1686
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:57,679
and then test some new technologies and

1687
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,719
network networking models

1688
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:04,239
and then at the time in this hackathon

1689
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:07,679
we first our first vlog is to discuss

1690
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,840
about the current status of

1691
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:12,239
ventrac for in the containerized

1692
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,480
infrastructure benchmarking area

1693
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:17,600
so the we the survey and then checking

1694
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,719
the other walks

1695
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,080
not only our our works so the one of

1696
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,360
them is the

1697
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,560
uh the open source activities

1698
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,320
which such as the bs puff in the opnfp

1699
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,840
and another part is that the industry

1700
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,120
the benchmarking test results such as

1701
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,159
the fdiu

1702
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,800
and then the pdk performance report so

1703
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,640
based on that so we

1704
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,400
are mapping

1705
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,199
our defined networking model category

1706
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:50,800
and the test scenario

1707
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,840
to map to the uh to

1708
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,960
to the other activities and then based

1709
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,840
on that

1710
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,159
we want to generalize our test

1711
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:02,560
architecture and then some the test

1712
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,920
cases

1713
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:07,199
and the next slide please

1714
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:14,560
yeah at the same time after we

1715
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,880
check the other activities and then we

1716
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,080
want to

1717
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,400
we are validating the other benchmarking

1718
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,120
works into the our lab environment

1719
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,360
uh so first is uh using the obs dpdk and

1720
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,880
then ppp memory

1721
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,920
and sriv and we

1722
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,000
set up this environment and then we

1723
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,800
measure the through food and the latency

1724
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,159
and the package drops in the some single

1725
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:41,040
port

1726
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,159
to the external traffic generator and

1727
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,400
the other is that the multi-post test

1728
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,679
scenario which is

1729
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:52,880
uh supported in the vpp memimp

1730
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,920
uh so and then based on this multiple

1731
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,000
port case and then size function

1732
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,280
chaining case

1733
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,719
we follow that scenario and uh and we're

1734
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:04,560
validating that

1735
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,080
and at the same time we using the

1736
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,840
uh the other or the technologies such as

1737
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,320
ostpdk

1738
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,040
with the same testing scenario so we we

1739
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,320
are

1740
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,920
comparing with the existing the test

1741
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:23,280
result for us

1742
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,320
compare their performances so these

1743
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,640
works are still on progress

1744
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,239
and then we will get the results soon

1745
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:35,519
okay next slide please

1746
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,920
so the uh based on the discussion and

1747
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,280
then validator

1748
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,400
uh so we need to update our

1749
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,440
related draft uh to rearrange

1750
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,199
our chapters and figures and words of

1751
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:57,120
uh uh it's more need to be more

1752
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,600
generalized and then up-to-date

1753
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,880
technologies

1754
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:03,040
and adding the other the benchmarking

1755
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,640
activities

1756
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,320
and then for the next hackathon so we

1757
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,600
are finding a remaining area for the

1758
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,320
benchmarking containerized benchmarking

1759
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,840
area so the first we choose is

1760
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,280
uh we choose multiples in a single host

1761
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,000
case

1762
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,760
or with the different acceleration

1763
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,840
techniques so there is

1764
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,040
some two-part one partition multiple

1765
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,159
to market report and apparently

1766
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:37,360
we send to the packet to the multiple

1767
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,640
two multiples

1768
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,480
and then another one is the

1769
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,840
training scenario which is traffic

1770
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,480
should be forwarded sequentially to or

1771
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,480
through the multiple ports

1772
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,600
uh and the other uh the testing scenario

1773
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,080
case

1774
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,360
uh can be the port or with

1775
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,560
multi multi interfaces so the using

1776
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,000
when the port using the multi interfaces

1777
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,360
and then going traffic simultaneously

1778
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:07,760
through

1779
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,360
the multi interfaces so we uh

1780
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,360
we want to the uh

1781
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,920
the venture came for them and and want

1782
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,000
to find some issues

1783
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,400
of which impacts to the performance of

1784
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,880
the containerized infrastructure

1785
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,159
okay next slide please

1786
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,600
okay so here is our team members so the

1787
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,480
professor young

1788
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,000
kim and then uh some guys uh in the

1789
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,040
uh iistrc the research center

1790
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,800
and then professor jayang poor zhang

1791
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,159
from sushi

1792
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,360
san jung university and then dr henshi

1793
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,960
yang from the kt

1794
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:52,000
so this is our member and then thank you

1795
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,639
for listening

1796
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,000
okay well thanks for uh for sharing and

1797
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,560
for the presentation

1798
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,920
any questions thank you

1799
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,159
i don't see anyone in the queue so

1800
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:15,040
thanks again

1801
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:19,760
kj and now we'll move to uh to well

1802
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:29,280
thank you

1803
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,679
and i need to stop sharing sorry about

1804
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:32,800
that

1805
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:42,080
no problem

1806
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,679
uh let me see

1807
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,719
right can you hear me

1808
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:56,960
yes excellent

1809
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,520
yeah so these are the results from

1810
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,159
project

1811
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,920
dns which turned out to be project

1812
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:07,920
zot so

1813
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:12,159
just like previous time we used this

1814
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,600
i used the metalmost chat surfer of the

1815
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,239
dns

1816
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:20,239
operations in analyzers research center

1817
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:24,320
because quite a lot of

1818
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,920
open source dns developers already there

1819
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,400
so it's a convenient and appropriate

1820
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,639
place to communicate

1821
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:35,920
and i it's also open to anyone

1822
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,199
so anyone can join

1823
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:42,239
in a chat on

1824
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:45,600
about dns hackathon projects they

1825
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,719
might have i have a link on the hexon

1826
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,000
wiki as well but so one

1827
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,040
month ago i changed

1828
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,320
the channel name into itf 110

1829
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:01,760
dns hackathon and

1830
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,360
just when i did that people started to

1831
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,000
complain a little bit right because uh

1832
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,679
it's a pity that we have to do

1833
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,120
online hackathon again and it would

1834
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,520
it would be better to have the in-person

1835
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,400
hackathon

1836
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,159
and you know with online hackathon

1837
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:23,280
i only have 15 minutes three times over

1838
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,960
the week to spend on this

1839
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,080
i would rather spend a lot more time on

1840
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:28,400
it

1841
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,880
and because dns developers actually

1842
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,480
have to work and are

1843
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:40,159
working all week and you know so

1844
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:44,400
anyway um so

1845
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,239
i decided well why don't we

1846
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,360
organize in-person hackathon day at

1847
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,800
the netherlab's office and i proposed

1848
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,239
that on the channel

1849
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:59,760
and most people were hesitant but

1850
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,080
at least one person was enthusiastic

1851
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,639
about it which is the dice

1852
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,600
and so we will have an in-person

1853
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,719
hackathon

1854
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,600
day tomorrow at the email network's

1855
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,639
office

1856
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,159
i'm looking forward to that one but

1857
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:18,960
besides that we also did the online

1858
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,520
hackathon

1859
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,920
so there were quite a few ideas for for

1860
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,800
dns

1861
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,600
people wanted to work on dns of quick

1862
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,440
and

1863
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:34,400
svcb came along catalog zones

1864
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,440
but those were all

1865
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:40,560
intentions which didn't actually turn

1866
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:40,960
out

1867
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,360
in actually actual work done

1868
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:44,239
unfortunately

1869
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:46,960
because you know we have to work uh

1870
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,600
except for

1871
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,639
this one zot so this is what i could

1872
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,239
find

1873
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:56,000
on the wikipedia which is like wikipedia

1874
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,040
but then in the

1875
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,360
star wars universe on zot it's

1876
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,800
apparently a sentient species

1877
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,320
but it's also a

1878
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:09,679
proposed a draft internet draft still

1879
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,800
it's a working group last call has just

1880
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,560
finished

1881
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,159
it's now in ad review state

1882
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:21,440
about having the zone the dns zone

1883
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,760
transferred over tls

1884
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,120
and so there's a lot of things

1885
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,199
that are involved with that uh like

1886
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:32,560
authentication that you don't if you

1887
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,480
really want your zone to be private

1888
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:38,000
you may not leak it

1889
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,920
in in clear text basically so there are

1890
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,960
some things you have to watch out for

1891
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,960
and related to salt this the transfer of

1892
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:51,600
tls is also the extended dns

1893
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,880
errors which is a part of salt if you're

1894
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:55,760
doing zot

1895
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,960
they assume you're doing extended dns

1896
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,320
errors too

1897
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,480
but actually not that many

1898
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,760
implementations yet

1899
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,480
of extended dns errors at least not in

1900
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,719
our software and also not in bind i've

1901
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,000
heard today

1902
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,600
so we had to work on that too

1903
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:18,000
sarah dickerson set up this excellent

1904
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,040
hackathon planning document

1905
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:24,960
in which you know everything surrounding

1906
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,159
salt was mentioned

1907
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,760
and other other steps and plants

1908
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,880
unfortunately sarah herself

1909
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,600
got ill this week so she could could not

1910
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,679
participate

1911
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,880
but chiffon palavi and han

1912
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,800
they were a unit that worked from

1913
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,360
east coast united states i think they

1914
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:45,920
had a

1915
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,120
mini group in which they

1916
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,320
talked over a google meet at an elnett

1917
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,040
lobs

1918
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,360
we have new guy named tom capari he

1919
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,199
worked on ede

1920
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,960
and all the work from pallavi hung and

1921
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:06,320
chifan was reviewed by walter weinhardt

1922
01:27:07,199 --> 01:27:09,840
paid from dyke he worked on shots for

1923
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:10,719
power dns

1924
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:13,600
in my ties making i don't know if he is

1925
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,120
already working on or

1926
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:19,520
will work tomorrow on salt for a bind

1927
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,920
and

1928
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:25,840
yes so

1929
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,800
part of the planning was also setting up

1930
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,040
a

1931
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:33,600
interoperability testing environment

1932
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,480
and from this i registered the domain

1933
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:36,880
name

1934
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:41,040
zotrox so i spent up a few virtual

1935
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:41,760
machines

1936
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,880
and gave everybody access to

1937
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,000
install their software and try out

1938
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,199
interoperability transfer zones over tls

1939
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:51,679
from

1940
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,760
each other with appropriate

1941
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,560
authentication

1942
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,560
so what got done tom capari

1943
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,280
he made extended dns errors for

1944
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,159
anestheda

1945
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,360
our authoritative name server from

1946
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,800
analyte lobs

1947
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,880
and this was quite interesting he found

1948
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,400
some missing error codes in the rfc so

1949
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,920
for example a specific error

1950
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,520
if your d name expansion

1951
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,920
overflows if you end up with a too large

1952
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,840
domain name this is possible

1953
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,440
it has a very unspecific response card

1954
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,280
currently

1955
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,719
pallavi worked on access control lists

1956
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:37,600
now if you're doing shots you should not

1957
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,480
do a zot

1958
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,000
on for the whole of the internet without

1959
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,280
t6 or without t6 is okay but then for

1960
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:51,120
specific ip ranges and

1961
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:55,600
yes interval probability testing of zot

1962
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,800
so what did we learn learn we

1963
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,000
all we still miss all miss the in-person

1964
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,280
hackathons

1965
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,480
that will have a mini one tomorrow yeah

1966
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,320
just me and matthias basically but

1967
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,600
that's i'm

1968
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,440
very much looking forward to that

1969
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:16,760
from ede maybe we need a update on

1970
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,000
8914 or maybe we come up with some more

1971
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,320
codes that are missing from that so

1972
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,400
that's nice and

1973
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,679
swot just works rocks so

1974
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:30,400
that's all good

1975
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:32,400
so these are the people that

1976
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,000
participated

1977
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,159
more hacks are coming tomorrow

1978
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:41,360
but maybe next week as well

1979
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,800
because the dna shop is on thursday and

1980
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,120
we can still do

1981
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,840
we want to do still catalog zones

1982
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,360
interoperability testing because it

1983
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,480
happened quite a bit

1984
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,600
on that draft too that's the end of

1985
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,800
my presentation

1986
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,719
on the azot hackathon results

1987
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:09,199
yeah thanks willem uh tom you're you're

1988
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:10,560
in the queue is that for the next

1989
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,080
presentation or do you have a question

1990
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:17,760
and if you have a question you can go

1991
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,840
ahead and and share it now

1992
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,760
um otherwise uh william i thanks

1993
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,800
you made uh dns and privacy and security

1994
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,719
look like a lot of fun i'm glad you have

1995
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,560
all that infrastructure in place

1996
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,280
i think that'll help uh with your your

1997
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:38,639
in-person hackathon

1998
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,320
i'm a bit jealous i have to say

1999
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,280
and i hope that uh you know we don't

2000
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,639
know about ihf

2001
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:49,280
111 yet i guess there's still a chance

2002
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:49,840
to

2003
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:51,760
do something in person so we'll see

2004
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:53,040
we're working on it

2005
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:57,120
yeah okay

2006
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:00,639
okay great thanks and we'll

2007
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,760
turn it over to tom tom if you uh

2008
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,560
request

2009
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,560
uh screen sharing you should be able to

2010
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,600
share your presentation

2011
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,760
okay can you hear me can hear you can

2012
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,080
see

2013
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:21,040
you don't see your screen share yet

2014
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,159
this says it's starting but then it

2015
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:29,040
kind of stops

2016
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,560
oh maybe it looks like you have the

2017
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,960
ability to share

2018
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:45,840
yeah i'm getting an error um

2019
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,560
get display media must be called from a

2020
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:53,760
user gesture handler

2021
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:59,840

2022
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,559

2026
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,199
to github yes i have

2027
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:19,360
all right let me go ahead and see if i

2028
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,600
can find it

2029
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,639
it says i'm sharing now or it's at least

2030
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,840
the request is going through

2031
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,080
okay i see you requested i granted

2032
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,679
access so we'll see if we have better

2033
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,000
luck this time

2034
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,440
now it says it's shutting down so

2035
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,080
if you don't mind sharing yeah let me uh

2036
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:55,840
let me find your presentation

2037
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,120
okay uh

2038
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,000
let's see what am i looking for here all

2039
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,440
the ns3 models

2040
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,839
just look for the name of yours

2041
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,400
um

2042
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,840
what what's your presentation named i

2043
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:18,400
don't see it it's um

2044
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:23,839
let's see

2045
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,840
hmm

2046
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:48,840
should be iatf110 hackathon presentation

2047
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,840
ns3

2048
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,360
and i had uploaded it about 20 minutes

2049
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,840
ago

2050
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,718
try to find it okay

2051
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,840
i don't see anything that's come in in

2052
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,199
the last

2053
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:24,639
hour maybe it's not in the 110

2054
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,159
uh projects

2055
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:33,839
do you see it now i mean reload

2056
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,639
no nothing

2057
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:43,600
all right well why don't i just uh in

2058
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,119
the interest of saving time why don't i

2059
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,839
just give it verbal

2060
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,519
okay

2061
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,800
okay so yeah sorry for the technical dif

2062
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,000
difficulties um

2063
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:00,239
so my name is tom henderson and i'm here

2064
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:03,119
representing typically the group that

2065
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:03,840
works on

2066
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,360
ns3 simulation models in the context of

2067
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,719
the iutf hackathon

2068
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:11,600
and i i think we've been doing this for

2069
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,719
five or six

2070
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,320
ietfs now in a row this time i was

2071
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,520
pretty lonely

2072
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,320
um it turned out that's many people who

2073
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:22,159
usually participates

2074
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,880
were busy with other things this week so

2075
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:25,280
i

2076
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,480
i basically worked pretty much solo

2077
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:33,199
i had one student stop by and

2078
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:37,040
he was able to help on a starter project

2079
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,000
essentially

2080
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,520
doing some validation of our tcp model

2081
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,600
but it was mainly just me hacking this

2082
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,440
week

2083
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:47,760
the topic that i focused on this week

2084
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,600
was

2085
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,400
protocols that are being discussed and

2086
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:54,000
under consideration in the transport

2087
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,679
area working group

2088
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:58,639
in particular there's a proposal for a

2089
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:00,880
new ecn response

2090
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,920
and protocol the

2091
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,280
initiative is called l4s and

2092
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:10,880
i was working to freshen

2093
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,560
our tcp prog congestion control model

2094
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,760
as well as a new aqm structure

2095
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,159
called the dual q which is a draft in

2096
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:20,960
the

2097
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,400
tsvwg working group and

2098
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,400
working on aligning those models both

2099
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,119
with our latest ns3 development tree

2100
01:36:29,119 --> 01:36:33,119
code as well as linux

2101
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:35,199
performance results that were conducted

2102
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:37,119
using the linux kernel implementations

2103
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:38,239
of those

2104
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:42,480
last year i also worked to finalize

2105
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,600
a couple of merge requests

2106
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,960
for different aqms we have

2107
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,280
from last year we had students working

2108
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,520
on

2109
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,679
just as there's fq caudal which is the

2110
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:56,880
default q disk

2111
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:00,639
in linux there's also an fq pi

2112
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:04,159
aqm and we have an ns3 model for that

2113
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:07,520
as well as fq cobalt which is

2114
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,639
a component of the overall cake

2115
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:12,880
q disc which is popular in the buffer

2116
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:13,679
bloat

2117
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,400
community and so i was able to finalize

2118
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,280
both of those

2119
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,679
and those will probably be pushed to the

2120
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:20,400
main line

2121
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:23,199
in a couple days

2122
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,560
as well as let's see

2123
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:32,639
so i would share the links maybe after

2124
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:33,119
the

2125
01:37:33,119 --> 01:37:34,560
after the presentation people are

2126
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,480
interested can download the slides

2127
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,800
uh all of our code is uploaded to git

2128
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,679
lab

2129
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:43,040
um our finalized uh proposals have been

2130
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,119
uploaded to

2131
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:48,880
the mainline ns3 gitlab.com

2132
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,440
instance

2133
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,880
and i would share some preliminary

2134
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,520
results of alignment between our code

2135
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:00,719
and in linux results but

2136
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:02,400
i guess that will have to wait or you

2137
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,760
could download the presentation at a

2138
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,880
later time

2139
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,560
in terms of what we learned this week i

2140
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:09,040
think

2141
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,280
it's really there's nothing that would

2142
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,119
change any of the existing drafts or

2143
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:14,880
rfcs it was more

2144
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,880
us getting our models aligned with the

2145
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,880
latest drafts

2146
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,560
but it's really just a capability that

2147
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,639
we'd like people interested in the

2148
01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:24,239
working group who

2149
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:27,119
may want a simulation model rather than

2150
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:28,560
working with linux code

2151
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,199
to experiment with these protocols so

2152
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,040
it's just a capability to be

2153
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,040
advertised to the transport area working

2154
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,960
group for people who wants

2155
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,920
simulation models of this work and it's

2156
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,040
just two credits

2157
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:44,000
we did have one students sachin nayak

2158
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,880
who

2159
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,280
was his first hackathon and i worked

2160
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,520
with him a lot on wednesday

2161
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,199
and otherwise it was just me working

2162
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:58,480
this week

2163
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:02,000
uh any questions for tom

2164
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,880
all right well tom thanks for sharing

2165
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,080
and uh we'll

2166
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,480
we'll get the uh you know where you're

2167
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:15,840
oh it looks like there is a

2168
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,440
is there a question and a chat yep

2169
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,199
uh yuri was just telling you good stuff

2170
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:22,719
tom um thank you

2171
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,440
yeah i agree we'll we'll get it

2172
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,040
straightened out where your presentation

2173
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:29,360
is and make sure it's it's uh

2174
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,080
it's been uploaded if it's not there

2175
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,760
already so that everyone else can find

2176
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:35,119
it

2177
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:38,320
and uh with that let me see

2178
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,280
if we have a vlad because we skipped

2179
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:42,000
over vlad

2180
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,600
earlier as well for a yang model for

2181
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:54,159
network tester

2182
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:56,400
i know vap let me know offline that he

2183
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,480
was working furiously to get

2184
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,480
uh things working and i met and that's

2185
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,320
what he's doing now so we'll prob he'll

2186
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,600
probably have something to share later

2187
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,480
on

2188
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,400
i'll encourage him to just send what he

2189
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,000
has to the list and

2190
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,600
an update to the list letting people

2191
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,199
know uh

2192
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:13,040
what if he uploads a presentation that

2193
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,760
they can go and grab it from there

2194
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,880
so with that i think

2195
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:23,840
let me jump back

2196
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,920
looks like i may be getting a problem

2197
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,440
with screen sharing now too

2198
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,600
crest is not allowed by the user agent

2199
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,199
in this context okay

2200
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:51,839
i'm going to try reloading

2201
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:23,760
reloading uh me protecto

2202
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:25,600
and coming back it seems like i can

2203
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,520
share now but sorry i was gone for

2204
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,880
a couple minutes there um

2205
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,320
so i think we got through all the

2206
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:35,440
presentations is there um

2207
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:37,119
tom i still see you in the queue but is

2208
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,800
that from your previous presentation

2209
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,840
or did you have something to add

2210
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,199
oh yeah yeah i didn't just probably

2211
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,839
okay

2212
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:50,239
great well i believe we got through all

2213
01:41:50,239 --> 01:41:52,320
the presentations just a reminder

2214
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,800
uh they should all be here in the 110

2215
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,159
project presentations

2216
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:59,040
um if any of you have updates because

2217
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,800
you continue to work on your project

2218
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,360
uh over the course of the next you know

2219
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:04,159
week or two

2220
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,080
or you know all the way up until the

2221
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,520
next hackathon that's fine you can

2222
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,560
always update

2223
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,000
what's here if there's something you

2224
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,760
think there's useful to share in terms

2225
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,719
of

2226
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,639
your results from from this hackathon

2227
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,960
and

2228
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,320
i do want to you know say a big thank

2229
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,159
you to icann

2230
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,400
they've supported us uh throughout this

2231
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,280
whole uh

2232
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:32,800
virtual uh online only hackathon and we

2233
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,719
really appreciate that

2234
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,760
and uh look forward to having them and

2235
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,520
welcome new sponsors i don't know if any

2236
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,040
of you follow um

2237
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:42,639
i don't know if it was on the ietf list

2238
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:44,400
there's a new

2239
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:47,360
structure for how sponsorship works they

2240
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,679
specifically call out things around

2241
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,600
running code of which the hackathon is

2242
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,199
of course one

2243
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:54,560
but there's other things too like the

2244
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,280
code sprint and

2245
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,800
you know other ways to get involved with

2246
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,480
code so hopefully

2247
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,560
uh that will help and we certainly

2248
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,040
welcome more sponsors especially when we

2249
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,679
get

2250
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,520
back to in-person meetings those are a

2251
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,159
bit more expensive for us to run

2252
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,760
so we can have the food and of course

2253
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,280
the beer and cocktails that everyone

2254
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,780
mentioned

2255
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:16,800
[Music]

2256
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,639
i just want to remind you again please

2257
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:21,040
uh

2258
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,400
for those of you who aren't here at the

2259
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,239
very beginning of today's

2260
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,320
closing we do have a survey for the

2261
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,360
hackathon

2262
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,119
and it'd be great if you could take a

2263
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:30,639
few minutes this is just for the

2264
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,159
hackathon i think it's like

2265
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:34,719
10 questions maybe even fewer depending

2266
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:37,119
on how you answer the first few

2267
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:40,000
and uh that'll help us we'd love to have

2268
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,080
feedback that'll help make

2269
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:44,320
future hackathons better whether they be

2270
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,320
online or in person

2271
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,040
and then um also i mentioned the the

2272
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,440
draft that i've put together that covers

2273
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:52,960
the hackathon

2274
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,719
really from a perspective of how to run

2275
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,639
it so that um

2276
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,360
you know i don't anticipate being a

2277
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:01,600
hackathon co-chair forever

2278
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,000
uh and i think barry has other uh things

2279
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
that he's probably going to do so

2280
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,920
in any case it's like everything else in

2281
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,600
the itf we like to have drafts that

2282
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,119
cover what we do and this one

2283
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,719
specifically the reason

2284
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,560
it came about now and it's in the schmoo

2285
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,840
working group

2286
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,560
is because um you know with the nature

2287
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,239
of having to meet online

2288
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:22,880
because of the current circumstances and

2289
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,639
other circumstances that may happen in

2290
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:25,760
the future

2291
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,920
uh it forced us to rethink a bit about

2292
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,080
how we run ietf meetings and certainly

2293
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,280
the hackathon

2294
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,600
and so this isn't specific to running it

2295
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,000
online it really covers all facets of

2296
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,440
the hackathon

2297
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,320
and um so especially for those of you

2298
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:41,040
who just

2299
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,199
you know you know participated in this

2300
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,360
one things are fresh in your mind

2301
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,360
it'd be great to get some feedback on

2302
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,480
that draft

2303
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,639
from from that perspective as well

2304
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:53,679
because i have my view of how it works

2305
01:44:53,679 --> 01:44:55,840
but uh but would love for you to point

2306
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,280
out things especially things that you

2307
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,560
think are important

2308
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:00,400
and that aren't mentioned in there at

2309
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,639
all that i need to call out

2310
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:04,560
um so that'd be great it will be

2311
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,800
discussed in the shmu working group

2312
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,800
meeting which i forget what exactly

2313
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,560
which day that is i think it's wednesday

2314
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,080
or thursday next week

2315
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,760
we'd love for you to be in that session

2316
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,000
but feedback directly to me or to the

2317
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,360
working group would be great too

2318
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,920
and uh with that uh we're going to wrap

2319
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,480
it up

2320
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,560
and certainly hope to see all of you

2321
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:27,679
next time

2322
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:29,440
and hopefully in person as we've

2323
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:31,360
discussed uh also

2324
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:34,320
if anyone has any questions any thoughts

2325
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,840
um

2326
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,239
uh happy to to take those now as well

2327
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,840
and actually i have one question for the

2328
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,520
group i see some people have already had

2329
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,960
to drop off but

2330
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,159
we had a new um template

2331
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:50,400
this time that people could use we've

2332
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:51,520
had a

2333
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,360
powerpoint version of that template that

2334
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,679
i know many of you have used in the past

2335
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,320
i think sarah put that together for us

2336
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,400
initially and it's been very helpful

2337
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:03,600
and this time benson um oh yeah i see

2338
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,719
benson's on

2339
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:06,639
he helped put together or he did put

2340
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:09,360
together an html version of that

2341
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:11,520
template which uh you know we talked

2342
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,800
about the kickoff

2343
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:16,000
just wondering if anyone did use that um

2344
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,159
if you did love to hear about how that

2345
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:20,080
experience went

2346
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,080
and uh as with everything with the

2347
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,119
hackathon we

2348
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:26,239
look to make it better next time so

2349
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,000
enhancements to the templates new

2350
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,280
templates

2351
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:31,119
anything else to make the hackathon

2352
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,880
better whether we're in person or like

2353
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,440
this would be

2354
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,080
appreciated

2355
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,239
okay well i'll close them by by thanking

2356
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:43,440
