00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,720
happening

134
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,520
at the interior working group and not

and agreed with eric

142
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,599
that would push the chicago sick fox

143
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,400
case probably a waiting edition

173
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,479
and the receipt of state means really

174
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,080
well advanced and

175
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,280
being reviewed by the rfc their team so

176
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
we're getting there with the shake of

177
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
allah one document

178
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
and then as you can see in the other

179
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,960
circle there is the

180
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,400
yang data model document

181
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,520
that for which we we actually pushed a

182
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
review request

183
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,360
to the young doctor so that that's why

184
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,519
you see this this review statement about

185
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
the young doctors

186
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
and so as you can see there are two

187
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
documents which are sitting there and

188
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,679
waiting for adoption

189
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,720
the very new lp1 architecture that that

190
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,519
alexander has mostly edited for now

191
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,240
and uh dominic's oem document which uh

192
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
would deserve some more new work as soon

193
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,360
as you can dominic you're welcome to

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
show us what's happening there

195
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,680
and with this alexander i will leave you

196
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,839
the presentation and

197
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,959
please thank you thank you pascal

198
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,160
yes please so um yes everyone

199
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,519
this is uh of course uh um we've been

200
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,160
waiting for

201
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,720
uh for a couple of years now but uh

202
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320
right now we've had a couple of major

203
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,640
main

204
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
milestones that we closed and we're

205
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
opening a new new fields that uh you

206
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,680
know

207
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
in this architectural work really shows

208
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,080
and the goal is to show how all these

209
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,680
bits and pieces work together

210
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,480
so we wanted the first thing to do is to

211
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,880
just

212
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,920
do a short recap of you know what the lp

213
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
ones are and how

214
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
uh how we are aiming at them so we

215
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
actually look some

216
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
slides that we use from the very first

217
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
buff that we had so

218
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,920
low power power wide area networks so

219
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
um click pascal or the canine yes

220
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
so low power these are things that are

221
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,279
designed to be working

222
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,839
many many years 20 years considerable

223
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,440
battery

224
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,040
so i click wide area

225
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,200
i cannot click next next slide please

226
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,320
so right there it's not able to

227
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
communicate over

228
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,120
very very long distances and

229
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,760
next slide here is actually the really

230
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
interesting part you know star topology

231
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,240
huge densities and we have case where

232
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
the communication is device

233
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
initiated with strongly asymmetric links

234
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
where the uplinks are much cheaper than

235
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
the downlinks

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,399
and the throughput is very very very low

237
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,040
right

238
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,519
and all that combined and on the next

239
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,320
slide please

240
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,640
all that combined you know we can have

241
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,640
operation in license free or in license

242
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,600
spectrum

243
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,079
and and there we have a bunch of other

244
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,720
questions

245
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,480
you know how to handle about you know

246
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
duties like cycling collisions and

247
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,720
and and you know the mode of operation

248
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
so basically what we are

249
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,079
what we tried what we done in this

250
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,920
working group until now is really to

251
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,640
to focus on all these different um and

252
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,959
the next slide please

253
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,399
on all these different um constraints

254
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,640
and different

255
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,920
considerations um next slide

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
maybe i'm it's it's not proceeding for

257
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,839
me

258
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,839
next slide pascal

259
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,320
so um i'm moving the slides i'm not

260
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
seeing them maybe someone else is

261
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,760
um and so we i was on slide

262
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,600
16 the one which says rfc 83676

263
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,839
lp1 architecture that's what uh

264
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,279
you're supposed to see okay thank you so

265
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,880
yes i'm i mean i'm i'm

266
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,639
okay it's getting a little bit slower to

267
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,000
me i think it's blocked but it's the

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,120
connection on my side

269
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,720
it's it's not terrible so so basically

270
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
um you know this is the architecture

271
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,240
where we have

272
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,360
uh uh you know the the the the overview

273
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,000
[Laughter]

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,800
you can find in all types of networks

275
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,839
from on the left hand side we have

276
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,279
devices that communicate

277
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,399
over the application of the long

278
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
distance to the rail gateways

279
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
then the radiators are connected to an

280
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,600
element that is called the network

281
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,560
gateway

282
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,639
that does the interconnection between

283
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,839
the the radio

284
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,680
and the application behind and that also

285
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,880
does uh the the authentication uh

286
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
of the devices and this part of the of

287
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
the security

288
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,000
so uh next slide please that will be 17.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
yes so this is where we also took

290
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,680
the uh uh this huge opportunity to

291
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,720
actually be working

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,680
with the four uh major uh lp1

293
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,800
technologies

294
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,000
and uh we did this that that's really

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,120
one of the one of the first major rf

296
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,959
documents that combines all these

297
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,880
technologies rfc 83

298
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,839
76 and i'd really like to to thank the

299
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,560
authors

300
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,600
of the draft that it's really uh um

301
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
showing you know they took really the

302
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,800
time to align

303
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
the the terminology and we decided you

304
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
know we need to have the ihf terminology

305
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,000
so we have this table like the device in

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,040
the itf course

307
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,000
and and the corresponding to terminology

308
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,480
in lure

309
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
one and and and in the different

310
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,920
in the different uh uh uh yes and the

311
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
different technologies

312
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760
so what's the so that's you know the

313
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
overview of the

314
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
of the work done until now what the chic

315
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,399
architecture document

316
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,120
um is doing is providing a reference

317
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,079
architecture

318
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
of how the different systems are working

319
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,199
together so for

320
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,880
until now we have identified two modes

321
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
of operation the

322
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
the first one is uh in the classical

323
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
chic device in gateway mode

324
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,800
where we have the device and the gateway

325
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,240
uh working together

326
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,880
and we also identified a mode that we

327
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,800
can call the shake peer mode where we

328
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,680
have peers

329
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,000
shake peer peer devices or shake pure

330
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
gateways talking to each other so the

331
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,680
architecture also

332
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,040
you know uh shows and the goal is to

333
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,000
show how to

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,600
the data model is used and how the

335
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,920
device and and how the

336
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
the rules are created and updated and

337
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,680
how they are

338
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
installed and discovered next slide

339
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,360
please 1919

340
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
yes so what we have is of course the end

341
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,800
device that needs to talk to the network

342
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
application

343
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,880
next slide uh

344
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
the network application is residing on

345
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
application server

346
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,320
next slide so we have the radio gateways

347
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,040
that are around the device then we have

348
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,480
the network gateway that

349
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,160
you know it's connecting to to this

350
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,839
radio gateways

351
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,320
and then what we have is like the the

352
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,279
full view

353
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,040
with the element that we call here the

354
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,399
sheet gateway so we have the sheet

355
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,240
device and the sheet gateway

356
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,800
uh that um you know so that that

357
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,399
corresponds to the to the

358
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,760
architecture of how the system is

359
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,440
working next uh

360
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
site yes so and we have uh ip uh

361
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,880
communication

362
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
like ipdp code but it can be any network

363
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,720
protocol communication between the sheet

364
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
device and the application

365
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,760
next slide please now when we zoom in in

366
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
the sheet gateway

367
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
we have identified that there are like

368
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,480
three uh functional

369
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,800
uh blocks there we have the rule monitor

370
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,680
manager

371
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,639
the rules and the chic compression the

372
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,000
compressor the compressor

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,800
and fragmenter a recombiner i could

374
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
all that functions right and the device

375
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,240
is basically

376
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,560
uh communicating with the with the rule

377
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,880
manager or with a protocol such as core

378
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,519
conf

379
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,839
and the rule manager is uh managing

380
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,800
actually the the the rules

381
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,240
next slide please so we can

382
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,399
basically uh do a zoom in the shake

383
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,360
device as well

384
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,639
and here what we can have is uh

385
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,720
like a full chic device and a full sheet

386
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
gateway communicating

387
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,079
to each other so both of them will have

388
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,920
the the chic compression compressor

389
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,880
decompressor and

390
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,519
fragmenter recombiner with both of them

391
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,880
have the rules and both of

392
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,639
them have rule managers and the rule

393
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
managers are talking to each other over

394
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,440
protocol

395
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,000
such as core code and uh uh the data

396
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,759
representation so the way the the way

397
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,880
the rules are represented

398
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,920
is by following the yang data model

399
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,600
right so that's when we are talking

400
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,519
about the the chic device and

401
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,680
the sheet gateway and the same thing

402
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,720
goes for

403
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,680
chic peer mode of operation so these are

404
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
actually quite metric and

405
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,519
we think that in most cases these will

406
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,959
be uh there will be a lot of

407
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,880
overlapping functionality it's just that

408
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
you know we'd like to keep for a moment

409
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,120
this separation because because the

410
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,480
device and she gateway

411
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,880
i mean there is this notion that you

412
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,000
know the chic device is

413
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,399
much less powerful than the gateway for

414
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,320
example whereas in chic peer

415
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
mode of operation that could be between

416
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
two gateways and both can be really

417
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,400
full-fledged and so here we have this

418
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,520
operation where

419
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,799
uh uh and uh yes so what what we have

420
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,000
here is an example

421
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,319
of that um operation where we are

422
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,119
talking

423
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,799
uh for on the network level chic so

424
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,319
that could she can operate on the

425
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,000
network level okay it can operate on the

426
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,880
application level

427
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,919
as with the co-op uh uh co-op of russia

428
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,679
and so here what we have is like this

429
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,039
expansion of

430
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,000
let's say if she too chic appears device

431
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,120
and she gateway

432
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
and we have the applications talking to

433
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,320
the ip stack

434
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,160
and we have uh how actually the room

435
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,480
managers are communicating the next

436
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,679
slide please

437
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
how actually the rule managers can be

438
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,200
communicating you know so

439
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
through core coffee or score but they

440
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,720
can actually be communicating

441
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,600
through the ip stack uh uh through the

442
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,880
through the ep stack

443
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,919
uh and uh going through the the shake

444
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,280
compressing the compressor and

445
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,200
fragmenter uh uh

446
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,480
recombiner uh and so the two rule

447
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
managers are communicating to each other

448
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,240
the room manager one

449
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,039
on the other hand

450
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,840
they can push to other place to to fetch

451
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,160
the

452
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
uh parts of the rules and

453
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,919
so really they're the build blocks of uh

454
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,600
this architecture allows

455
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,799
the fifth start from the bootstrap to

456
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,840
discovery to

457
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,880
you know the operation of uh two chic

458
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,919
levels um things if you wish check

459
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,120
device fit between or shake peers

460
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,400
so um that's oh

461
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,840
really sorry to to hear that so that

462
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,679
that's the end of the of the

463
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,360
presentation

464
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
okay alex thanks so much uh you are

465
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,640
breaking up a little bit but i hope that

466
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
people could actually hear

467
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,679
um yeah so as eric says on on the chat

468
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,160
as well

469
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,960
yes there was the audio was not perfect

470
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,440
but

471
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
on my side i could get most of what you

472
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,440
were saying i mean don't worry

473
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,280
too much um and

474
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,919
then the next speaker will be lauren

475
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,400
about

476
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
the young data model so do you

477
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,600
do wish to share your screen or do you

478
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,320
want me to move the slides laura no you

479
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
are doing it very well so

480
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,520
i'm the best page

481
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
go ahead okay so i will present the

482
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,360
version 4

483
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,400
of the young data model

484
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
so can you go back

485
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,320
to this one so uh there is no more

486
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
difference between the three and the

487
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,720
four

488
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,840
we have now a model that is quite stable

489
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
so the only difference is some

490
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,000
clarification in the text

491
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
so i remind that the goal of this

492
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,880
document is to define what we

493
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
the value of what we find in uh in chic

494
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
on rfc8724

495
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
and there is two functions one is

496
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,960
to define identifier that we will use

497
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,559
in the chic rules and to define the

498
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,200
structure

499
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,159
of this rule either for fragmentation

500
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:16,480
and

501
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,400
compression so uh we

502
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
as a xavier is a strong link now with

503
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,679
the

504
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,039
architecture draft and here is just

505
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,600
the definition of the young data model

506
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,640
so we don't

507
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,840
look at how to implement it and

508
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,120
all this thing will be done next using

509
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,240
for instance core conf

510
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
so for the on the next slide please

511
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,799
next one so here is a way we define

512
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,240
identifier

513
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
so first we defined for example here is

514
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
for uh

515
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,039
their acs

516
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,840
algorithm so we defined the identity

517
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,360
based

518
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
and then we derive all the algorithm

519
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,120
that we can find

520
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,720
using this identity reference

521
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
and from that we defined a type def

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
that will be used on the structures

523
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,200
so next slide so here is all the ideas

524
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,159
that you find

525
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,799
in in the draw in the draft or in the

526
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,919
young model so you

527
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,640
we have things for identity type so it's

528
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,559
all the field that we will

529
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,080
compress so its cover ipv6 udp

530
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,200
co-app underscore so these are things

531
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,840
that are in

532
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,919
rfcs or in future rfc there is also

533
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,520
icmp v6 from the aom draft that is

534
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,720
still at the draft level right now we

535
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
have the fin length type that can be

536
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,679
either a length or

537
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,960
a function that can be var or token

538
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,840
length

539
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
we have the direction indicator up down

540
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,679
or bi-directional we have all the four

541
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,840
matching operators of eight

542
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
compression decompression action and

543
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
that's for the compression and for the

544
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
fragmentation

545
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
we have the rcs algorithm as we saw in

546
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,000
the example and right now we have only

547
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,840
one single value we have the

548
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
fragmentation mode

549
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,480
we have on some parameter also

550
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,240
for uh icon error

551
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,840
next slide

552
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,120
so here is an example uh shake so i saw

553
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,080
chic is

554
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,080
uh okay

555
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,240
so here we have the identity so here is

556
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,679
an example next slide

557
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,520
and here is another example including

558
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,039
co-op options

559
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,080
and all that stuff so uh

560
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,799
it can look long then of course we will

561
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,440
not

562
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,760
we cannot send that on the neon

563
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,039
constraint network

564
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,720
so we will have to use qualcomm for

565
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
example to have a value

566
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,600
instead of this long ascii string

567
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,919
okay next slide for the structure so the

568
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:06,559
structure

569
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,799
are quite common to what we see

570
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,840
in the rfc so we have

571
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,120
a rule so rule is a a chic

572
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,640
set of rule is a list of rules each rule

573
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,960
is identified by a rule id and a rule

574
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,159
length

575
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,720
and then we associate two of these keys

576
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,760
either a fragmentation rule or

577
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,280
a compression rule that we will see

578
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,919
after so for the fragmentation world we

579
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,760
have a part that defines

580
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,440
the chic header so the secular will

581
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,960
start with the tag window

582
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,000
size and uh sorry the tag

583
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,039
window on the fcn and here we indicate

584
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,919
the size of these of these fields we

585
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,919
have the rcs algorithm

586
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,480
and then we have parameters that are

587
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
used by the state machine

588
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
and that are defined in the annex

589
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,279
of uh 8724

590
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,960
and for icon sorry can you go back and

591
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,679
for

592
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,320
uh icon error we have also some

593
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
operation mode

594
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,159
mod tides in all one or add behavior

595
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,080
that can be defined

596
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,440
for the compression next slide so

597
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,480
a compression rule is a list of entry

598
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,960
an entry is identified by a field id a

599
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,240
field position

600
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,440
and a direction id indicator and

601
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,279
here you will and after that you have

602
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,360
the list of all the fields that you find

603
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,559
in

604
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,559
ascii table in rfc8724

605
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,200
so one discussion maybe we can have it's

606
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,080
about

607
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,120
the field length dominic rays that maybe

608
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
this field can be optional i agree

609
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,159
so we have a question mark here too to

610
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,919
say that it's not mandatory to

611
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,400
to feel it but it will be present in the

612
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,039
model

613
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,880
because we see some usage for for it

614
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,400
next slide uh so

615
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,200
right now we have a quite stable draft

616
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,120
we have discussed it in several interim

617
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,000
meeting

618
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
we have also some informal meetings with

619
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,440
uh

620
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,120
some offer and dominic made a

621
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,159
a very nice review of of the document

622
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,039
so now i think we we can go forward and

623
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,919
be ready for working with school or ask

624
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,360
for working group glasgow

625
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,279
okay thank you very much lauren

626
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,400
before the workplace go i guess we we

627
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
want to see the result of the

628
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,799
young doctors did you get any news eric

629
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,080
on the young doctor's review

630
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,760
i was basically about to ask laura

631
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,159
whether he got some private replies

632
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,600
on my side i got nothing back uh

633
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,559
so maybe we need to circle back uh over

634
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,600
email on this

635
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,120
because this thing is important we're

636
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,840
going to the last call

637
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,960
solo on the news right

638
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,400
to answer thank you sorry

639
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,880
you i think i cast you you didn't get

640
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,679
anybody contacting you

641
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
i have to check again my mail because if

642
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,159
it's a

643
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,799
personal mail maybe i have missed it but

644
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,440
i'm not sure

645
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,080
okay okay so let's do a round of

646
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,640
applause

647
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,360
okay thank you very much one point on

648
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:33,840
the

649
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,360
on the on the working group

650
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,360
so i mean we have the document for quite

651
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
some time and um

652
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,440
uh i i i get that really i get the

653
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,320
feeling and i

654
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,720
i did a couple of reviews i i probably

655
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,520
need to do

656
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
uh one last public review but it seems

657
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,440
to me that the comment is quite

658
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,919
um i mean it's finished in in many

659
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:54,880
aspects

660
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,960
so launching and working with classical

661
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,760
seems like a good idea in the sense that

662
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,600
then of course we'll need to put in copy

663
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
networks probably

664
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,440
and uh and and you know that will

665
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
put people also in the in the in the

666
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,720
sense that hey well you know we

667
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
considered it was done

668
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,200
and um you know if there are any reviews

669
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,960
now is the time to do that

670
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,080
so um there are basically two things

671
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,840
in in a document like this right there

672
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
there is do you have all the content

673
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
and for that there is nothing better

674
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,919
than an implementation we have a number

675
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,440
of implementations

676
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,279
so we can actually check the content and

677
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,200
the content was written based on those

678
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,960
implementations so we're pretty safe

679
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
there

680
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,240
and the second thing is uh i would say

681
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,679
the yankness

682
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,480
of the document i mean is that the way

683
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,960
that

684
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,520
you know the young experts would uh

685
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,399
express

686
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,520
the things that we have in the code and

687
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,240
and

688
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,840
otherwise i mean yes i mean there's

689
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,520
nothing opposed is the worker plus

690
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,200
we really would like to see the young

691
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
doctors come up to us

692
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,840
so we can review the final format for

693
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,320
the world cup last call

694
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,559
but like you i'm up here with the

695
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,760
document assist

696
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,600
if it was not for the young doctors i

697
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,360
would be launching the one for classical

698
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,720
okay um it's um you have

699
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,320
you have two more minutes than scheduled

700
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,000
one colors so the ball is yours

701
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
do you want to share the your

702
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
presentation or should i push the slides

703
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,679
as i did so far

704
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
uh if you can push this light pascal

705
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,120
probably

706
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,880
so that we can keep going so thank you

707
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,240
very much everyone

708
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
uh juan carlos suniga here and uh

709
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,399
presenting an update on the

710
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,440
she cover sick fox as well as the

711
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,640
taichik hardcore uh

712
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,520
code so uh we've been working again on

713
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,000
the

714
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,559
offline coding uh with help from the

715
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,360
university of

716
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,559
chile and uh university of uh uh

717
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,159
catalonia for the icon error and noac

718
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,600
parameter optimizations uh we this time

719
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,799
were focusing on error conditions that

720
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,080
have been tested uh for the last updates

721
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,840
uh we added a

722
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,440
long list of uh message sequence

723
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,000
examples that explain the different icon

724
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,960
error and

725
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
no ack and chic error scenarios that

726
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,559
we've been testing

727
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,559
and very importantly we have also

728
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,039
updated the the co-authors list

729
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,760
because of the strong contributions from

730
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,960
work

731
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,240
we have now welcomed the sergio diego

732
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,960
and sandra

733
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,919
onto the authors list so thank you very

734
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,440
much for the help

735
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,640
and uh out of that in fact uh we have

736
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,640
also been working on

737
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240
compound chicago message proposal

738
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,120
with the intent to save on the on the

739
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,720
protocol overhead number of

740
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,520
acknowledgement

741
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,240
messages on different situations but

742
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,559
still keeping the flexibility of

743
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,440
the noack mode where we can send

744
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,320
opportunistic

745
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,360
acts over a session so

746
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,159
for this we are going to show some

747
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:00,799
slides

748
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,960
and i'm going to pass it on to sergio

749
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,960
right now

750
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,919
my name is serge aguilar i'm from upc

751
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,520
and i will be presenting to you the

752
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,200
proposal regarding the

753
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,559
compound act message in account error

754
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,520
over sig fox

755
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
when cheek fragment losses are present

756
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,440
in intermediate windows

757
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,640
at least one act is generated when the

758
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,480
cheek fragment losses are presented in

759
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,760
the last window

760
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,039
at least two acts may be generated

761
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,880
and independently on the cheek size

762
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
the sigfox down downlink payload size

763
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,520
is fixed to 64 bits

764
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,760
therefore when errors occurs over

765
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,799
multiple windows

766
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
the number of facts can be reduced by

767
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,480
reporting losses

768
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,760
of several windows in a single lakh

769
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,200
here we have an example of a 14 tiles

770
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,840
chick packet with with a window size of

771
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,200
seven tiles

772
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
and errors over multiple windows in this

773
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,399
case

774
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,600
we have three act messages can we go to

775
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,480
next slide please

776
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,679
the component principles are in this

777
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,480
case

778
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,279
it only includes it only reports windows

779
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,320
with fragments

780
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,200
with chic fragment losses for each

781
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,760
bitmap

782
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,679
the window number must be included

783
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,840
it may not fit all bitmaps of all

784
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,919
windows for a cheap packet

785
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,880
it has a variable size and is compatible

786
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,559
with the cheek receiver award message

787
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,200
format

788
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,159
and the act failure message format and

789
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,399
the advantages of the compound act

790
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,399
is the the act reduction in this case

791
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,600
the aggro option is related to the

792
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,799
number of regular chic fragments minus

793
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,559
the number of windows minus one

794
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,360
in this case as a number of windows of a

795
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,720
cheek packet increases

796
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,760
also the act reduction will increase

797
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,360
can we go to the next slide please

798
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,559
here we can see the proposal of the

799
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,120
message format

800
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,480
the act header is fixed and is the same

801
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,200
as in the

802
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,640
are in as in the rfc 8724

803
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,840
after the first bitmap

804
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,480
you may add as many window number plus

805
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,679
bitmap groups

806
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,120
as windows with losses in this case

807
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,440
you can add as many as you can fit on

808
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
the downloading

809
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,240
on the downlink payload size in this

810
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,919
case we can see the example of the

811
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,240
compound knack of the 14

812
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,399
tile sheet packet transmission we saw

813
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,240
before

814
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,080
can we go to the next slide please

815
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,360
other details about the compound act is

816
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,600
that the window number plus bitmap

817
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,200
groups

818
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,279
order from the smallest window to the

819
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,640
largest

820
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,360
and if the window number zero has error

821
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,080
in this case

822
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,519
is present in the india it must always

823
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,159
be

824
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,480
between the rule id and the save it to

825
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
avoid confusion with the zero padding

826
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,799
bits

827
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,679
in this case we included this example

828
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,880
that is of a

829
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,919
14 tiles chick packet

830
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,679
because it was more clear

831
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,279
there is also in the presentation

832
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,000
another another example of a 28

833
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,480
cheek packet size with also error

834
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,159
distributed in all windows

835
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,880
where we use the where you can see also

836
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,559
the ag reduction

837
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,200
and using while using the message the

838
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:39,840
compound

839
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,919
message format next slide please

840
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,760
thank you very much for your time any

841
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:53,840
questions or comments

842
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,720
yeah dominique

843
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,679
hello can you hear me yes yes

844
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,200
good night congratulations

845
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
i was wondering you just mentioned that

846
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,280
the you avoided confusion with padding

847
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,918
bits

848
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,480
uh and you said zero bits does that mean

849
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,599
that you mandate

850
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,760
in the sick fox profile that padding

851
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,599
bits are zero

852
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,040
or is it is it actually is

853
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,359
in in the act if i'm not mistaken in the

854
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,320
rfc

855
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,918
in the 87 24 the ack

856
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,239
the negative act format has padding bits

857
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,320
of zero

858
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,440
well so is z6 still using the same

859
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,679
format regarding the padding bits

860
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,159
8724

861
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,040
has padding bits and it recommends that

862
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,079
padding bits are

863
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,320
zeros but it does not mandate that

864
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,918
padding is zeros

865
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,399
that's up to a profile so i was just

866
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,359
curious if

867
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,440
you have defined in the profile that the

868
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,119
padding bits are zero

869
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,119
and then you're safe i'm not saying it's

870
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,480
broken i'm just asking

871
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,839
i'm i'm not sure but we have been using

872
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,480
as as the other

873
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,240
rfc the zero padding just make sure it's

874
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,040
written that padding bits must be zeros

875
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,880
otherwise your

876
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,079
distinction may not work okay

877
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,000
and also are you using a bitmap

878
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,520
compression when you

879
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,720
do this uh aggregation

880
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,359
or is that actually yeah we thought

881
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,880
about bitmap compression

882
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,000
but in the downlink payload size of sig

883
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,800
fox is fixed to 64 bits

884
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,560
we have extra extra room for for using

885
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,760
we don't need the the compression that's

886
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,160
the

887
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,920
thing so we are not using bitmap

888
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,599
compression right and

889
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,520
it's probably safer that it's not data

890
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,040
dependent on which you might be

891
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
exceeding the payload size

892
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,520
okay got it right yeah indeed uh

893
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
dominique just to add uh

894
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,200
that this is uh let's make it makes it

895
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
more predictive because we know exactly

896
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,440
how many bitmaps we can always

897
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,760
fit and uh and also because they can be

898
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,119
discontinuous

899
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,880
discontinuous the this uh gives us some

900
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,280
clarity on the on the format adding the

901
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,160
window

902
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,760
bits in the beginning of the of the

903
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,839
bitmap

904
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,200
right thank you

905
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,040
the window is higher than seven bits and

906
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,920
you can detect it

907
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,440
among the padding

908
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,839
sorry could you repeat the question no

909
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,119
but if the padding can be seven bits

910
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,560
long no more not more so if you have a

911
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,000
window

912
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,440
what you call the ww here is more than

913
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,200
seven bits then it will be detected

914
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,880
yes in this case i'm not i'm not sure

915
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,760
but we are using

916
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,200
padding until the 40 for in this example

917
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,680
we use 42-bit spanning to feed the 64

918
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:23,040
frame of sigfox

919
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,520
right so so the proportion here is to is

920
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
uh what we're saying is uh

921
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,359
we we're trying to comply as much as

922
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,960
possible to

923
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,480
to the rfc 8742 but then we

924
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,200
we believe that there's a lot of things

925
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
by using this format so

926
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,359
we are proposing then to to add this

927
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,119
format definition

928
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,920
in the draft i mean i don't see why you

929
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,839
could not i mean you can always

930
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,880
inherit from an rfc and add

931
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,160
additional methods so if you want if

932
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,240
that's what you want to do and if it's

933
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,880
the best for your case i mean just do it

934
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,800
okay it's just a new message format so

935
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,000
you can always propose a new format

936
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,320
right so yes the only thing the group

937
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,560
can can do is just what

938
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,839
lahore and um

939
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,400
i think the question is more do you do

940
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,839
we generalize this to

941
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,800
over protocols or if we keep it to

942
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,920
sigfox there is no

943
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,760
no problem because here we we know that

944
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,920
the downlink is as a fixed size and so

945
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,800
you can

946
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,920
do tricks and beat values but is

947
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,599
can be generalized to something else

948
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,640
okay as presented it looks very very

949
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,440
uh opportunistic to the sigfox case

950
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,000
so i don't see that we need to define it

951
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
elsewhere

952
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,800
and if if another rfc wants to know if i

953
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,720
don't know nba ut but it won't need this

954
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,440
but

955
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,920
um if another rs in the future needs

956
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,839
this it can always take inspiration but

957
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,040
probably they will

958
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,800
they will tune it slightly differently

959
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
so i would not make too creative

960
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,079
thoughts

961
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,119
to try to generalize it it's a great uh

962
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,040
opportunistic technique for the case of

963
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,680
sick fox and certainly i encourage

964
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,160
but let's leave it at that for now and

965
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,800
how about i mean so actually that's a i

966
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,320
think that's an excellent question what

967
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,280
if

968
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,640
some other technologies would be

969
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,520
so i i you cut alex but um

970
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,079
i think hearing hearing uh the inputs

971
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:46,640
here

972
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,880
maybe what we can do from our side is to

973
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,160
to make sure that we

974
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,320
document correctly the principles the

975
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,079
advantages and then that with ability to

976
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,520
seek help so that

977
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
if ever other technologies want to

978
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,480
inherit or point to the same principles

979
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,320
and advantages they can do so without

980
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,160
necessarily going to the specifics of

981
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,440
sql

982
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,000
okay yes they will probably redefine

983
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,240
which would be very he could inherit

984
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,040
from this

985
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,599
but might be slightly different it's

986
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,200
really opportunistic i mean just the

987
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,560
fact that the ack has

988
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,640
so many beards that you can really fit

989
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,560
more than one window in there

990
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,839
it's i guess it's the it's

991
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,720
matches sick facts and the fact that you

992
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,160
don't want the links and you want to

993
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,240
compress them into one message i mean

994
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,440
all this is

995
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,079
is sick folks but um it's nice i mean

996
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,680
you you re-optimize

997
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,040
that's why we wanted to have those

998
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,119
technology drafts right to optimize for

999
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:42,319
each given case

1000
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,400
but how do we know that the next case

1001
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,640
will need exactly that or would

1002
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,319
do its own slide variation so now it's

1003
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,839
yes you said you make it public you

1004
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,319
explain how it works and if ever another

1005
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,680
technology needs something

1006
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,760
like that similar but maybe their own

1007
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,200
version of it they will define it as

1008
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,839
well

1009
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,240
very happy with this spending time on

1010
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,760
trying to generalize this

1011
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,480
now it looks like overkill to me okay

1012
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,760
dominic yeah

1013
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
i would just recommend sorry i didn't

1014
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,960
have time to read

1015
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,359
the new version of the draft on this but

1016
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,440
i would just recommend that you

1017
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,640
make it very explicit how an

1018
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
implementation can distinguish between

1019
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,800
the the regular arc message and the new

1020
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,680
one and

1021
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,880
what are the criteria

1022
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,119
and of course it's probably simpler than

1023
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,520
in the general case of 8724

1024
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,800
because you have a bright alignment and

1025
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,640
we spend quite a lot of time describing

1026
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,079
all this how ambiguity is avoided so i'm

1027
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:44,640
just

1028
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,599
hoping this will be the same level of

1029
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:48,480
description

1030
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,599
in this draft thank you yes thanks by

1031
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,480
the way just to

1032
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,560
to add on that uh thanks for the input

1033
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,520
and uh

1034
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,680
we wanted to first show the concept and

1035
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,760
get feedback so we have not

1036
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,920
documented in the latest version of the

1037
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,960
draft yet

1038
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,119
this uh this proposal we wanted to first

1039
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,319
hear the feedback

1040
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,359
so our plans are now to take all this

1041
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,560
uh comments uh and information feedback

1042
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,560
etc that you have given us to

1043
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,480
to make a new version of the drafting

1044
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,160
and then include the details

1045
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,280
but uh but yeah dominique to you we have

1046
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,040
added some some slides on our

1047
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,480
presentation to to

1048
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,119
explain as much as possible the concept

1049
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,560
that's where you will find information

1050
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,240
but otherwise

1051
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,079
you can expect some more details in the

1052
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,280
in the next version of the draft

1053
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,119
so dominic do you still have the slides

1054
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,720
that you presented when you

1055
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,880
explain the working of check and you

1056
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,640
explain exactly those because if you

1057
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,280
could

1058
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,000
dig the slides and send them to one

1059
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,480
colors maybe one colors could build

1060
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,200
um some similar slides using similar

1061
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,720
formats and then we could merge all

1062
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,680
these in our tutorials

1063
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,960
um okay try and do that

1064
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,240
i'm not sure i had slides we had slides

1065
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,119
every so often on the new improvements

1066
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,400
but i think

1067
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,720
the the content went actually in in the

1068
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,480
text of the rfc

1069
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,760
but yeah i'll see what have as a

1070
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,520
material that could be a starting point

1071
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,000
because it's yes to understand exactly

1072
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
the games of the zeros and

1073
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,960
ambiguity and avoiding ambiguity that's

1074
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,000
one of the most tricky

1075
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,280
things in shake this this all zero arc

1076
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,040
so uh having slides which explain

1077
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,880
exactly how it works that's

1078
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
very useful i thought you you presented

1079
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,319
something like that

1080
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,000
at 180f but okay okay i'll look it up

1081
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,319
okay so but that would be nice to just

1082
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,240
extend that with okay here is the

1083
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,240
difference for sick farts

1084
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,480
how it works and have a single story

1085
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,280
that we can

1086
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,119
review you know because reviewing is a

1087
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,240
bit hard in this case

1088
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,400
okay so actually um it's pretty much

1089
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,359
time for this

1090
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:09,839
slot we can take one more question

1091
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,119
well i guess that's it uh thank you so

1092
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:13,599
much for

1093
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,040
for this presentation i really love when

1094
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,720
we have a technical discussion like this

1095
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,200
during

1096
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,040
an atf meeting as opposed to just going

1097
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,240
through slides

1098
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,359
so um yes please let's let's build this

1099
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,040
the slides for an intro

1100
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,200
where we explain exactly how we do the

1101
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,160
ambiguity

1102
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,079
uh how we resolve the ambiguity today

1103
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
and how that

1104
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,119
that is done in six folks and make sure

1105
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,440
there is no room for any ambiguity

1106
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,640
okay so next

1107
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,599
will be uh anna you have five minutes

1108
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,760
and now on the club static

1109
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,319
thank you you want me to to move the

1110
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:47,119
slides

1111
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,160
yes please so yes

1112
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,680
um hello everybody i'm happy to announce

1113
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,960
that

1114
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,079
we have successfully sent this

1115
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,400
draft to the rfc editor

1116
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,599
we received our last uh comments from

1117
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:06,880
benjamin just

1118
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,480
to be for the iutf and

1119
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,400
we work with eric to

1120
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,000
to post the last version this monday

1121
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,520
so now we are done is is going to the

1122
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,720
editor

1123
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,240
so congratulations to everybody

1124
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,560
that has give input to this work

1125
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,359
um for for my next slide i would like to

1126
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,480
explain more quickly the changes between

1127
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,440
version 16

1128
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,520
and version 19. how this has been

1129
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,880
moved from

1130
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,200
over the versions because it has been

1131
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,960
done very quickly

1132
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,160
so in version 16

1133
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,359
we have rewritten section 2 with the

1134
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,200
uses cases

1135
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,359
and keeping all the same

1136
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,480
terminology section 6

1137
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,960
with the co-op extensions

1138
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,680
[Music]

1139
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,040
to explain better how to compress them

1140
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,720
section four uh we put a new

1141
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,160
introduction

1142
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,359
for the new header options if

1143
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,640
in case there were a new option created

1144
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,280
for

1145
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,800
co-op so this is a new part

1146
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,880
and then for we send it for revision

1147
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,400
in version 17 and 18 i put it together

1148
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,680
because

1149
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,240
there's not so much differences because

1150
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,960
when i published version 17

1151
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,000
i saw that i forgot an

1152
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,440
a comment from benjamin so i published

1153
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,240
version 18 with this new comment

1154
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,800
for the big big big difference is the

1155
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,000
section of co-op

1156
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,200
options for variable land

1157
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,319
fields and the security section

1158
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,520
again and the last

1159
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,440
um not the least but

1160
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,240
as soon as benjamin verifies the version

1161
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,119
18

1162
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,520
he accepted and he give us a

1163
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,280
present he give us a

1164
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,559
security section for this draft

1165
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,200
so i want to thank you very much

1166
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,800
benjamin kaduk

1167
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,640
for this valuable input

1168
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,200
so there are many literal needs and you

1169
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,960
can verify them

1170
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,960
next steps of course we we wish that

1171
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,520
we get 1924 because this will

1172
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,040
give us the the same number of

1173
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:55,359
cheek 24 so we will see

1174
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,200
i guess we can ask for something like

1175
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,119
this if we contact

1176
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,640
the rfc editor in due time

1177
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,559
unless they have already attributed this

1178
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,160
this number

1179
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,760
you can send me a reminder i don't think

1180
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,640
you can you may i may and i think it's a

1181
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,400
nice idea so anna please send me an

1182
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,240
email i will do my best

1183
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,920
okay thank you and then you owe me some

1184
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,359
chocolates right yeah we feel it

1185
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,160
thank you very much i mean that doesn't

1186
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,680
make sense eric because the best

1187
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,800
chocolates are from belgium anyway so

1188
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,640
yeah so if there are some questions uh

1189
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,839
something else

1190
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,160
no so so just like i said it's an edit

1191
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,079
state meaning that the rfc editor has

1192
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:42,960
not yet

1193
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,079
put his hand on this but only been there

1194
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,680
for two days so

1195
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,800
yes that's it we send it on monday so

1196
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,760
yes and also pressure that we push out

1197
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,240
oh you're breaking up alex but yes

1198
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,280
sorry i don't understand

1199
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,760
congrats

1200
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,480
if you write it in the chat perhaps we

1201
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,920
can read it

1202
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,520
or if you use reliable and available

1203
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,440
wireless or something else

1204
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,839
nothing important congrats yeah

1205
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,680
okay so we will move on to the next

1206
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,160
slide

1207
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,480
we are pretty much in time so thank you

1208
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,319
so much and now again

1209
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,040
and uh let me now do the final

1210
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,559
presentation

1211
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,440
so um this is

1212
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,000
so this is actually a document which is

1213
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,200
being followed at the

1214
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,319
interior working group but uh for which

1215
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,760
we really need help

1216
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,640
from the the

1217
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,440
lp1 working group because it's dealing

1218
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,920
with shake and how to use shake

1219
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,240
for at least some part and um it's not

1220
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,920
the expertise that

1221
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,000
we can expect from interior and we

1222
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,040
really expect that it

1223
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,359
expertise to be coming from this group

1224
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,480
so i will keep

1225
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
keeping the group aware of everything

1226
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,760
that happens on this document

1227
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,040
so for now it's uh chicago ppp but as

1228
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,640
you know we did it because once you have

1229
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,839
ppp you are full

1230
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,760
because ppp was initially designed for

1231
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,280
serial lines but then

1232
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,160
there is pppoe for how you do ppp over

1233
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,920
point-to-point ethernet

1234
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,119
uh even across the switch fabric and uh

1235
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,640
then once you have ethernet you have

1236
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,640
wi-fi so you can basically apply

1237
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,119
shake to to a number of technologies as

1238
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,720
soon as you do shake over ppp

1239
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,680
as alexander mentioned in the

1240
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,440
architecture document

1241
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,400
typically the model for chico ppp would

1242
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,200
be a symmetrical peer-to-peer model so

1243
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,839
we'll discuss that

1244
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,359
what we do in this draft is we signal

1245
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,440
um in existing ppp signaling

1246
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,000
a new compression there is already a way

1247
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,359
in ppp to signal

1248
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,960
which compression you're going to use

1249
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,520
you can use from jacobson for instance

1250
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,079
here we're going to use check so we just

1251
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,079
added in a new

1252
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,000
a new compression and i guess the value

1253
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,640
was 2 meaning check

1254
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,040
now when you signal the compression in

1255
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,559
in an option of ppp

1256
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,800
when you set up the the call you can

1257
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,000
also signal

1258
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,400
uh some parameter and the only parameter

1259
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,440
that we signal

1260
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,480
here is actually a url

1261
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,680
um where we expect that uh the data

1262
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,240
model

1263
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
based on the young document that that

1264
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,920
the laura has just

1265
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,720
explained would be located so the idea

1266
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,599
here

1267
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,960
is compared to the normal

1268
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,079
old version where you ship a chic device

1269
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,920
with hard-coded rules

1270
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,160
that may even you know always use the

1271
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,680
compressed format and never really

1272
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,680
operate in the uncompressed format

1273
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,280
here the model is both sides operate on

1274
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,559
ip

1275
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,760
and they both fetch

1276
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,200
uh the rules from a same place

1277
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,240
so they they are kind of as alexander

1278
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,800
said they're kind of both gateways

1279
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,359
and uh so they both get the the

1280
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,800
compression from that place

1281
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,319
i expect that the compression is

1282
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,160
symmetrical so it's not like there is a

1283
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,559
device side and the gateway side

1284
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,359
um that would be symmetrical and and

1285
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,079
they will basically

1286
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,079
apply the rules that they fetch the same

1287
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,559
place which is the way we ensure that

1288
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,599
um we get matching state in

1289
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,040
in the compression under the compression

1290
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,880
so for this effectively we have a

1291
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,680
dependency on the chic document

1292
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,960
so i just placed here the shape

1293
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,559
of a packet as

1294
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,920
it would be if

1295
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,000
the document is implemented as is right

1296
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,520
now so you can see that the rule id

1297
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,720
occupies

1298
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,920
uh the first two bytes aft after the the

1299
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,040
ppp protocol signaling ipv6

1300
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,160
and um so the compressed p is the what

1301
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,280
we call the residue

1302
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,720
occupies uh something and the alignment

1303
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,559
is in the draft is done uh

1304
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,680
at some you know to align to one byte at

1305
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,200
the end of the compression residue but

1306
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,559
the expectation

1307
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,240
is that there will be some content in

1308
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,880
the packet which will not be compressed

1309
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,680
um so we we have this extra thing that

1310
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,760
does not appear and check

1311
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,000
with the uncompressed payload from the

1312
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,800
original so

1313
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,040
we we we expect to compress up to some

1314
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,440
place do the padding there

1315
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,920
and then add some more bites all the way

1316
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,520
to the end of the packet

1317
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,200
so it's not exactly matching what

1318
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,040
you may expect from from the chic

1319
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,880
document but

1320
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,040
the question is is it against the rule

1321
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,800
or is it acceptable

1322
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,880
um and it's back to to the same

1323
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,079
discussion as uh

1324
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,119
sick fox right if if that's how we do it

1325
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,000
in this environment well worst cases we

1326
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,319
can say that this document updates at

1327
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,359
87.24 but

1328
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:16,000
i'm still not clear if it's legal with

1329
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,839
8724 not to do it this way

1330
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,400
um so the document is pretty old i need

1331
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,359
to refresh it

1332
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,119
uh by the end of this month um

1333
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,800
so the other rules i don't have much

1334
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,480
time so i won't go through these details

1335
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,559
they were presented at the interim

1336
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,960
basically that's we we now have

1337
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,240
compression for the rules

1338
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,960
and we do a fragmentation and the reason

1339
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,960
for doing fragmentation

1340
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,960
is if you want to use a deterministic

1341
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,480
network which operates really really

1342
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,359
fast

1343
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,839
and you want to be able to schedule it

1344
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:48,960
what you want to do is

1345
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,480
is bring every frame down to a small

1346
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,280
and same size so you can reschedule

1347
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,520
independently of what the packet is

1348
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,280
and so for this shake could be a very

1349
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,960
very useful tool because you would you

1350
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,799
would say hey let me align everything to

1351
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,440
64 or 128 bytes

1352
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,319
and you would compress every frame which

1353
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,759
is bigger than that down to that

1354
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,160
um so yes as alexander presented this

1355
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,559
creates a purewise relationship

1356
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,640
in the architecture i suppose the device

1357
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,559
gateway

1358
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,799
there is not any of the endpoints which

1359
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,240
we charge the compression rule which is

1360
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,680
what i was saying

1361
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,000
and we guarantee that they they have the

1362
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,960
same state because

1363
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,799
both will fetch it from the same place

1364
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,200
and that's pretty much it i don't have

1365
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,280
much time to go through this flow

1366
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,760
uh the real question for today is first

1367
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,240
thing i'm a bit alone on this one

1368
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,400
um is there somebody who's willing to

1369
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,839
work with me on this

1370
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,079
so feel free to raise hands now or

1371
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,160
contact me on email

1372
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,319
um there was the question of the

1373
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,760
applicability statement

1374
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,319
all i've been saying here is actually

1375
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,040
not written in the document

1376
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,480
i expect that the architecture will

1377
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,400
cover a lot of it

1378
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,359
but do we need to say hey here is why

1379
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,280
you would do fragmentation here is why

1380
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,880
you would do

1381
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,240
compression blow here is why it's useful

1382
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,559
and do do we want some text on that

1383
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,680
um i think it's important to have it

1384
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,680
because

1385
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,839
for example when you put the padding in

1386
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:28,960
the middle

1387
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,200
it means that it's not so efficient with

1388
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,559
fragmentation

1389
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,280
so i think that in ppp you don't expect

1390
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,280
a chic fragmentation

1391
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,200
so are you here

1392
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,839
i lost you um

1393
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,319
let's go

1394
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,720
so he's still connected i'm not sure

1395
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,799
and also there was eric in the queue

1396
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,319
eric i got muted

1397
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,640
i'm back

1398
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,440
hello eric

1399
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,359
yes we are you pascal okay

1400
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,839
so i don't know how long i've been muted

1401
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,960
when you when you talked

1402
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,680
you weren't talking in your eyes and you

1403
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,400
disappeared

1404
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,599
when i finished my question oh

1405
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,559
i didn't do anything

1406
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:32,240
okay so i was asking uh

1407
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,720
so for the applicability statement and

1408
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,760
you said yes

1409
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,599
and i was wondering if there is anything

1410
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,119
else that you would like to see in this

1411
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:41,839
document

1412
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,680
oh basically i also answered you maybe

1413
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,880
to nobody

1414
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,119
that this is an option to have some

1415
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,400
uncompressed data at the end of the

1416
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,559
packet now if you want to fragment

1417
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,319
probably you would not be doing this but

1418
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,319
it's it's an additional capability that

1419
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:57,119
i have

1420
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,680
if you if you're not doing compression

1421
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,920
so yes maybe we can explain that

1422
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,359
that's that would be a good thing to

1423
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,359
explain but you don't have to put

1424
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:06,559
uncompressed data after

1425
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,400
after the padding you you may do

1426
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,640
something

1427
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,359
so i think it's better to explain why

1428
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,480
i'll use it

1429
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,880
it's for example it could be to interact

1430
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,480
to

1431
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,160
interconnect some chic gateways

1432
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,280
but i don't think it's the case so uh

1433
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,480
it's more to for real-time systems yeah

1434
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:28,880
i can

1435
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,400
i can give you examples that i have in

1436
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,480
mind that have not applied check yet to

1437
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,760
those environments but

1438
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,359
for instance in the smart grid

1439
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,799
infrastructure there is a protocol

1440
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,480
called goose

1441
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,480
and if you're aware of goose it's a very

1442
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,559
very chatty problem

1443
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,000
where you have to expand very long names

1444
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,160
so before the frame says anything it

1445
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,480
transmits a lot of bytes

1446
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,960
to just give give always the same very

1447
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,040
long ascii string names

1448
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,760
and what i wanted to do in this case was

1449
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,119
to be able to compress

1450
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,119
all those goose headers which gives you

1451
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,040
those long names and blah

1452
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,240
and provide the goose data in the

1453
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,520
uncompressed way

1454
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,240
just just just compress all these these

1455
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,880
very very long headers that they have

1456
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,640
and and not fragment actually in that

1457
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,559
case

1458
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,240
so that wasn't that's an example that i

1459
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,400
had in mind i knew i did not write about

1460
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,160
it i did not even do the exercise of

1461
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,599
applying chic to goose

1462
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:25,520
but it seems to me that it makes a lot

1463
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,200
of sense from what i understand of how

1464
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,160
good works

1465
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,839
so that's why i have this kind of

1466
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,960
example

1467
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,200
so perfectly yes go ahead

1468
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,920
just want to enforce and second your

1469
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,520
comment about

1470
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,960
this working group following the

1471
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
discussion on the interarrier working

1472
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,599
group

1473
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,680
you know that subscribing to a milling

1474
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,200
list is easy

1475
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,400
and the interior is on friday so please

1476
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,839
go review and have pascal as a co-author

1477
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:01,839
on this draft that's very important

1478
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,799
okay so i guess we we're getting out of

1479
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,400
time for this meeting

1480
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,799
um so if you think about extensions if

1481
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,480
you want to contribute with me on this

1482
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,440
draft

1483
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,680
um if you have ideas about the

1484
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,200
applicability statement and

1485
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,359
and things that i may have missed about

1486
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,040
where it can work why cannot

1487
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,119
work and everything is welcome on the

1488
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,160
mailing list

1489
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,319
please come back to me on anything like

1490
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,280
that

1491
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,440
and with this we we are getting to the

1492
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,119
end of this meeting

1493
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,200
um so we have just a minute or two if

1494
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,400
there is any uh

1495
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,880
aob

1496
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,799
i don't think so so thank you thank you

1497
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:41,040

1498
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,319
thank you for one

1499
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:46,480
very interesting session and a very

01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,760
interesting couple of months

1501
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,160
since the last itf and looking forward

1502
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,760
for the next interview

1503
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,079
and uh excellent work everyone thank you

1504
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,000
thank you pascal thanks eric

1505
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,240
and congrats to the authors of the

1506
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,400
shikko app and the chico valor award

1507
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,319
that's great achievements that we did

1508
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,599
here

1509
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:06,880
okay so meeting isaac drone thank you so
