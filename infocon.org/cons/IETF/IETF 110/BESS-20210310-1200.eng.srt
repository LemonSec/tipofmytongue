8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,040

carriage which was

under time permitting but i guess we

21
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
should be able to uh to understand

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,839

24
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
a status update uh one rfc

25
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
has been published since last time so

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800

00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,959
5549 and this is the

28
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,920
only one published we still have bunches

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,520
of documents in vrfc editor queue

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,080
mainly due to some dependency especially

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,720
for the vpn prefix advertisement where

32
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,959
we still have a dependency and via

33
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
intercept net forwarding

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,879
draft which has been in isg and 84

35
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,840
for a long time and there are still

36
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
pending discussions

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,120

38
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,560
we don't have aliens connected

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,959

update on the inter subnet forwarding

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
the mpls label 2

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
is referenced and uh we should

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,200
mark the document as updating it via

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
7433

49
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,480

52
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,560
some audio issue

53

55
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,400

be able to

66
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,879
to come to a resolution regarding this

67
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,840

we will not be able to

82
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,639

84
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,080
that this is manageable and we don't

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,800

110
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,919

document forward but it's not a release

116
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,759
job to do

117
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,520
to do the edition so we really need

118
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
support for the

119
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,560
all the coders of the document to to to

120
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,280
make via

121
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
the appropriate edition so we can we can

122
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,080
move forward

123
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,360

especially on

126
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,080
on the highest and lowest priority and

127
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,520
how we do it

128
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,479
um i think we are really really close to

129
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,880
uh

130
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,759
to a resolution so the document should

131
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,560
be able to

132
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,400

140
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
addressed and a new revision

141
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
of the document has to be posted or

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
maybe it has been posted

143
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
at the beginning of the week i haven't

144

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
yeah there's a bit of discussion on the

148
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
list about it they did post an

149
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,039
update i think and um there's a little

150
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,319
bit of discussion going on on the list

151
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,639
so we'll see that successful first

152
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960

153
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
martin has given comment on inter subnet

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
forwarding draft that

155
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,039
it will lose ballot because of iesd

156
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,520
change

157
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
and it will have to go through another

158
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
telecheck

159
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,680
sure

160
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,720
okay status of the last

161
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
polls that we have sent

162
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,080
so there was a recent poll on the evp

163
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,319
and irb extended mobility

164
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,560
so the poll has been closed and iran

165
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
just to provide couple of

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,800
updates very minor comments but

167
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
it needs to be addressed before moving

168
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,400
forward

169
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
on vpws fxc unfortunately and this is

170
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,919
not the first time we

171
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,120
really got very very few response

172
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
during the poll which is putting

173
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,479
us chairs in a very bad position because

174
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,159
if we have very few responses it's

175
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:34,958
really

176
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
hard for us to tell if there is a really

177
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
good consensus to move the document to

178
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,719
our

179
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,080
to the next step so we will extend

180
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,200
the poll and we are really requiring

181
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
feedbacks positive or negative with

182
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
comments

183
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,399
to to ensure that we can move forward

184
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:54,800
with

185
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,599
with the document

186
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,240
on the evpn lsp ping

187
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
we are still waiting uh on the mpls

188
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
shares because um at some point after

189
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,519
the working group last call

190
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
the inr consideration section was not

191
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,839
uh written in in a good way because mpls

192
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,560
was

193
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
uh doing some change in the registries

194
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
and so on

195
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
so the change has been done but we need

196
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,080
to uh

197
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,720
to have the mpls shares validating

198
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,800
what what has been done so we can we can

199
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
move forward

200
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,040
on the weighted hrw there is still

201
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
one ipr reply which is

202
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
missing from ali so we cannot move

203
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
forward until

204
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,839
we are closing uh all aprs

205
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
we don't have any document yet which is

206
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,320
ready for its first working group call

207
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
however we have two documents where we

208
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
need a new working group last call

209
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,440
uh because there was some substantial

210
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,480
comments

211
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,880
uh that have been addressed or changed

212
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
introduced in the draft so we need a new

213
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,360
a new working group review and we will

214
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
proceed

215
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,360
right after the atf with this newer

216
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
short working replace call

217
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
so the first one is beyond an equal cost

218
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,040
slot balancing

219
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,720
so there was some controversy a couple

220
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:30,959
of

221
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,120
itf backs of uh reusing the existing

222
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
link bandwidth communities and so on so

223
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
everything has been sold

224
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,600
all the references have been cleaned uh

225
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,120
so we need a

226
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
review again of the working group to

227
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,320
ensure that

228
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
we can move forward with the new with

229
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,959
the latest version

230
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,560
igmp mld proxy there have been a lot of

231
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
comments

232
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,160
addressed and i think luke has also

233
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,880
provided

234
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,880
additional comments so the offer will

235
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,480
have to look at the new comments that

236
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
have been provided

237
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
and as soon as they have been addressed

238
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,720
we will again do a new shorter working

239
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
or passcode for this one

240
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,399
we have one new working document

241
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
from the last atf which is the evpn

242
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,519
redundant

243
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
multicast source and we don't have

244
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
uh yeah we just have a single document

245
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,959
which is

246
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,200
ready for working group adoption in our

247
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,079
queue

248
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,560
so if you think that your individual

249
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,480
document could be ready

250
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,040
for working or production don't hesitate

251
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,079
to uh

252
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,600
uh to pull us um you don't have to wait

253
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
for an atf to to do that just

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,279
send us uh an email and we will um

255
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,880
assess if your document could be uh

256
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
could be ready you know if we can

257
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,839
add it in our queue

258
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,000
working group document update

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,320
i will not go through all the updates

260
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,360
that we have

261
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,160
received there are a couple of documents

262
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,800
where

263
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,519
that are in on the agenda so we will get

264
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920

265
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,279

266
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,279
are couple of them where we have

267
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,480
no statues so

268
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,839

269
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,720
this one

270
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
but it has been cancelled so we don't

278
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,279
sentence to

279
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
it's actually ready so uh we presented

280
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
it last ietf

281
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,519
and we actually requested last call

282
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,760
uh okay so we are missing it in our in

283
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,800
our list so

284
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
yeah in this case don't hesitate to

285
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,320
check the wiki

286
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,839
uh to ensure that our queue is accurate

287
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,440
and if we are missing anything

288
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,079
uh don't hesitate to contact us again

289
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:20,639
okay

290
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,519
yeah thank you i i had one more question

291
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,560
about the uh

292
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,360
easy p90 pvpn interworking draft i know

293
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,399
there was

294
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,160
there was some discussion ending with

295
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
the idr working group but uh i haven't

296
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,600
seen anything

297
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,880
happening in in idr so

298
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,839
yes exactly and this is what i have

299
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,600
could recommend that i'm still

300
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
pending some replies from the uh

301
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,399
idr share so there was if i remember

302
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,639
correctly two points to address

303
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,800
and discuss which were the rules of

304
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,279
aggregation and also the

305
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,800
uh how we are managing the propagation

306
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,279
of the attributes especially what

307
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,360
process do we need to uh

308
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
to introduce between the two groups to

309
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
ensure that every new attribute is

310
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,560
getting

311
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,519
the right propagation rules uh so i

312
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,320
think we have

313
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,519
jeff and sue connected

314
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,440
maybe i have missed the reply but i

315
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,959
haven't seen anything

316
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,040
on my side soon jeffrey

317
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,519
any comment on your side

318
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,279
now i'll answer since it's it's my fault

319
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,399
um due to the chair switch uh

320
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,600
we're behind on a few things uh we will

321
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,360
try to get back to you

322
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
uh with by the first uh week or so in

323
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,600
april

324
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,160
okay okay yeah absolutely absolutely but

325
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
yeah this is something that we really

326
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,199
need to close because today it's

327
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,880
blocking the process of our document

328
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,600
i have it as one of the first things to

329
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,720
do

330
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,279
on my target list after dealing with a

331
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,480
couple

332
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,760
problems with um on open

333
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,880
working group calls so yes i understand

334
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,959
yeah and if we need if we need to set up

335
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
a call between chairs to uh to discuss

336
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,560
that point there is also absolutely no

337
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,519
no issue we can

338
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,240
we can set up that to to speed up the

339
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
resolution as well uh

340
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,639
uh again after this after itf

341
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,800
people usually take a week off but after

342
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,760
that

343
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,079
let me make sure i'm aligned with my

344
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,759
other new chairs

345
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,759
uh thank uh i will be missing john

346
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,279
uh and always good work you know

347
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,160
uh but after we let me discuss it with

348
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,000
my new chairs i have been

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,639
at least trying to bring them on board

350
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,519
at

351
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,959
after that i will probably send you and

352
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
uh the other chair is my right up

353
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,320
because some of the original discussion

354
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,040
was mine

355
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,199
thank you thank you sue uh

356
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,399
okay and i have an issue with two other

357
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
drafts so the first one is the fast df

358
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,240
recovery

359
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,959
because apparently the draft is uh

360
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,279
having multiple solutions and one which

361
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,000
is the

362
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,040
n-check solution uh looks really

363
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,639
complex not sure that it's well proven

364
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,560
so i'm really wondering how we should

365
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,800
move this document forward

366
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,440
and if one of the solutions to move the

367
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,959
document forward could be to

368
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,040
split the document and to have the

369
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,199
distribution of the engine completely

370
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,480
separated so

371
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,880
i i would like i would be happy to hear

372
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
the opinion of her

373
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
of the editors of the drafter regarding

374
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
the receiver of the progress

375
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,639
and the other one is uh evpn geneva

376
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,880
so there was a couple of comments after

377
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,720
the working room classical

378
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,560
and the draft has expired and

379
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,680
nothing has been replied and i

380
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,799
so the draft was edited by sami if i'm

381
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,319
not mistaken

382
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
and i guess sami has moved to uh to to

383
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,000
some of her

384
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,640
uh responsibilities so i'm even not sure

385
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,119
that

386
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,280
he actually wants to to continue the

387
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,520
worker

388
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,000
on that one so i will try to pull him

389
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,799
again

390
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
and in case he don't want to uh to

391
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,720
continue we may need

392
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,840
a new editor to uh to to close this

393
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,520
draft

394
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,640
and this is uh what we have

395
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,120
for our presentation so if there is no

396
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,840
particular question regarding our status

397
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,840
we will move towards the presentation

398
00:17:49,120 --> 00:18:01,840
again you are the first one

399
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,120
okay all right hi um my name is

400
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,919
guillaume mishra sorry

401
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,160
hi all right we can hear you

402
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,840
yes okay

403
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
hi my name is gion mishra i'm with

404
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
verizon and

405
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,480
i'm providing an update for distract uh

406
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,200
so this draft primary use case related

407
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
to the draft is to be able to carry

408
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,760
ipv4 nlri over an ipv6 next hop

409
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,960
so uh with this with this draft up

410
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
the major update that we've had with

411
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,400
this draft is we have

412
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,520
five vendors on board supporting this

413
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,400
use case

414
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,679
so this primary use case is it's it's

415
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,679
it covers any any use case where you

416
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,600
have any type of edge peering so

417
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,960
ebgp edge peering pc peering

418
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
either core or data center enterprise or

419
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,559
service provider

420
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,440
where you have um dual stack peering so

421
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
now instead of

422
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
having dual staff hearing the best

423
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,640
practice would be

424
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,400
you know once the interoperability

425
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
testing is completed between the five

426
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,679
major vendors

427
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,039
in this uh draft is uh

428
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,039
published is that we would now be able

429
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
to carry uh that v4 enter

430
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,559
an lri over an ipv6 next top the major

431
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,320
gain is that we would eliminate all v6

432
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,120
peering

433
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,240
um on on the edge period and it does

434
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,280
allow the further proliferation

435
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,240
proliferation of ipv6 and elimination of

436
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,280
edge so

437
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,840
object savings so no more vcd for

438
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,760
addressing on that edge tiering

439
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,960
um as well as opex cost to maintain the

440
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,000
v4 edge period and of course ipv4

441
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
address depletion

442
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,160
the five major vendors that we have on

443
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,039
board that's

444
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,160
that confirmed supporting this feature

445
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,000
we have from cisco we have our

446
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,919
representative

447
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,320
from juniper we have lily wang from

448
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,039
nokia

449
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,760
we have adam simpson and from aristo we

450
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,120
have queen yang

451
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,360
and then finally from huawei we have

452
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,400
sheng long chen

453
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,760
so those five vendors are uh the folks

454
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,799
that i've mentioned

455
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,720
are the primary point of context for the

456
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
interoperability testing

457
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,960
uh legit and logistics of getting the

458
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
interoperability testing completed as

459
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
quickly as possible um our goal is to

460
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,799
get the uh

461
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,120
once once this draft is adopted we would

462
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,280
like to get

463
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
started on logistics related to the

464
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
interoperability testing for this for

465
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
this document

466
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,120
um as as the support is there but we

467
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,799
want to make sure that any operator

468
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,000
around the world we have got some

469
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,200
feedback verizon

470
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,919
included that they want to start the

471
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,640
proliferation proliferation of ipv4

472
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,600
ipv6 on the edge and elimination of e4

473
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,799
appearing so

474
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,840
this this is a um it's a hot draft that

475
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,559
um

476
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,480
i think a lot of them a lot of operators

477
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,240
around the world can really take really

478
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
tremendous advantage of this trap so um

479
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,919
once we've got achieved work of adoption

480
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,159
we'll start in the logistics testing

481
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,559
and try to um advance this trap as

482
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,919
quickly as possible

483
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,840
um if you could go to the last page

484
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
thank you yeah because you have a lot of

485
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,000
slides so and you just requested five

486
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,200
minutes

487
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,640
yeah you can just go to the last slide

488
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,799
it's okay is that okay so

489
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,039
we have we have all five vendors on

490
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,720
board and then um

491
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
if you can go to the one slide before

492
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,440
this and this is work group adoption

493
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
we're just working just the work of

494
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,720
adoption um

495
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,960
okay there you go so um so we would like

496
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,520
to ask uh any feedback from the work

497
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,080
group

498
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
uh related to this draft uh progressing

499
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
as a best practice we have had a lot of

500
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,799
feedback from operators

501
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,640
at verizon included as i mentioned that

502
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
we have the five vendors on board

503
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,480
um and we want to start the

504
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,240
interoperability state testing as

505
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,880
quickly as

506
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
possible as as this is a hot topic and

507
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,400
um

508
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
as there is tremendous gain to to

509
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,600
eliminate the um

510
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,400
v4 period the edge hearing uh one last

511
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,640
thing i want to mention is that uh

512
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,880
in discussing with the five vendors uh

513
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,400
we did talk about the iv

514
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
rc to rfc 8950 update

515
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
which is related to the art of sapphi

516
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,679
128 129

517
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,960
next hop encoding where 5549

518
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,400
um had signatures a 16 byte and 32 byte

519
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,120
next hop encoding uh which did not have

520
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
the rd field included

521
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,559
so the update is to uh 24 and 48 so

522
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,559
as as the primary use case for this

523
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,400
draft is for safy

524
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
one ipv4 unicast carry over ipv6 next

525
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,720
stop

526
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
we decided that for this

527
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,240
interoperability testing

528
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,200
we will just test that primary use case

529
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,960
and then really the goal is to kind of

530
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,039
to get this get the interoperability

531
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
testing done as quickly as possible so

532
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,200
we can progress this draft and get it

533
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,000
published so

534
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,720
operators around the world can start the

535
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
elimination of v4

536
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,679
and the overall ipv4 and address to

537
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,200
depletion issues on on

538
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,600
major appearing points um that uh folks

539
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,039
around the world can start um

540
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,039
immediately uh taking advantage of of

541
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,520
the uh that primary use case

542
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
thank you does any if anyone has any

543
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
feedback um i think i

544
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,080
just opened up the floor if they have a

545
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,840
minute or two for anyone who has any

546
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,280
questions or comments on the straps

547
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,600
thank you

548
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,080
any comment i don't see

549
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
anyone quick quick question i i have

550
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
seen that you have set the

551
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,159
document as a best practice document

552
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,760
yes right for this one

553
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,760
yes so i changed it it was standards

554
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,320
track and i changed it to best practice

555
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,960
um so so this this would become like the

556
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,120
ubiquitous best practice for any edge

557
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:55,919
peering

558
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,440
to carry ipv4 an lri over an ipv6 next

559
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,919
top

560
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,679
once we complete the interoperability

561
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,520
testing this would make this the

562
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,039
the official uh practice for any any

563
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:07,679
operator

564
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,200
they could they can look to this

565
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
document as a um as that primary use

566
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,000
case

567
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
uh to help with that proliferation and

568
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,000
we have all the results of the

569
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
interoperability testing you know in

570
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,679
this draft so anyone looking at this

571
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,120
draft once published

572
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
will feel comfortable the operators

573
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,919
around the world will feel comfortable

574
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,600
that they can start that

575
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,600
elimination before elimination

576
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,799
okay okay so we will take your request

577
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,440
to uh

578
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,760
to the list we don't have any additional

579
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,520
comment thank you again

580
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,640
okay thank you thank you next one

581
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,840
is donald for evpn bfd

582
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,799
hi uh it's donald eastlake uh i'm just

583
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,600
going to give a quick

584
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,840
update on this draft with a lot of

585
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
things on the agenda so i don't want to

586
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,039
take too much time

587
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,240
next slide so this talks about

588
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,120
evm vfd graft which is about fault

589
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,880
management for the network layer

590
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,279
uh the last part of this slide is

591
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,400
incorrect

592
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,679
uh omr request

593
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,840
requirements framework sorry is not in

594
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,000
the enter his queue it's uh waiting

595
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,799
right up

596
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,159
so i can send corrected slides if you

597
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,640
like

598
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
next slide

599
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,240
this shows the oam framework that is in

600
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
that graft which is uh

601
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,640
waiting right up and this craft i'm

602
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,120
talking

603
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,799
primarily about here it concerns the

604
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,559
network oem layer there

605
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,960
between the pe's and well in yellow next

606
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,840
slide

607
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,799
so this just talks about the other

608
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,520
layers briefly and what kind of uh

609
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,799
technology you would use for continuity

610
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,400
connectivity checking in these other

611
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
layers including of course the

612
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,880
end-to-end ethernet service of evpn and

613
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,480
cfm for that

614
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,039
next slide

615
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,520
so uh this craft evp and vfd

616
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,320
talks about bfd proactive fault

617
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,919
detection

618
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,320
and it covers mpls and vxlan

619
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,679
encapsulation

620
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,400
unicast traffic using point-to-point and

621
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,080
multi-point to point

622
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,960
bomb traffic using multi-point point and

623
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,200
phone traffic using point to multipoint

624
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
next slide

625
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,720
and these are the things that are out of

626
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
scope does not talk about

627
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,880
packet loss or delay measurement uh

628
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
other encapsulations beyond that

629
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,919
uh irb multi-point to multi-point or

630
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,919
vfd echo next slide

631
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,480
so what's changed uh the previous draft

632
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,320
was a little unclear it tended to speak

633
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,799
about oam and fault management pretty

634
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,240
generally at least in the

635
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,559
sort of introductory in the heart

636
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,559
abstract and stuff like that this graph

637
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,200
is clear

638
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
that it's just focused on network layer

639
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,679
fault management

640
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,400
uh it this draft includes an extension

641
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
to the bfd discriminator

642
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,159
path attribute i'll talk a little bit

643
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,240
more about that on another slide

644
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
the existing attribute only covers vfd

645
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,200
active tails point to multi-point use

646
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
it allocates a unicast mac address as

647
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
well as a multicast mac address for use

648
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,960
as an inner mac address when you need

649
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,000
that

650
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,399
and it as usual has some minor tweaks

651
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,559
and editorial clarifications from the

652
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,279
o2 version next slide

653
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,799
so on vfd discriminator uh this is

654
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
specified in the um best mvpn fast

655
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,120
failover which

656
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,039
really is in the rfc editor queue this

657
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,120
statement is correct

658
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,559
and uh as uh

659
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,799
specified in that draft there's a bfd

660
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,960
mode field that gives the

661
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
the uh this attribute where you can

662
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
associate the vfd discriminator

663
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,520
over the path has uh the vfd

664
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,279
discriminator optional tlps and also

665
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,440
this mode and currently only one mode

666
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,399
is specified which is specifically for

667
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,760
point to multi-point

668
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
vfd sessions so this draft adds a mode

669
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,320
of the vfd discriminator path attribute

670
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
for point-to-point vfd sessions since it

671
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,559
it needs that uh the tlv is there

672
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,440
there's the one

673
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
tov defined it's in the mvpn fast

674
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
failover draft which is for source ip

675
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,520
address

676
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,600
and it's required to provide the ip

677
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,559
address of the

678
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,000
multi-point head for a point to

679
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
multi-point vfd session and it's

680
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
used that way in this draft as well as

681
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,520
in the mvpn fast failover draft

682
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,440
next slide

683
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,320
so comments and suggestions welcome uh

684
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,039
the plan

685
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,840
is what's planned by the authors is to

686
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,919
add

687
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,000
pbbn to this draft coverage

688
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
and then to request working group last

689
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,919
call uh which we believe we can

690
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,240
should be able to do before the next

691
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,080
ietf meeting so i wanted to present at

692
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,200
this meeting just to

693
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,080
update people on the status of the draft

694
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,679
that's it

695
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,399
okay jorge go ahead with your question

696
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,360
yeah i just wanted to say that uh so

697
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,880
last time i i made a

698
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,240
few comments and uh and i

699
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,679
i didn't see any updates or

700
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,760
you know any changes addressing those

701
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,440
comments in the new version

702
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,840
so i i sent an email this morning um so

703
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,720
if you can

704
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,200
you can look at it and and address my

705
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,960
comments that would be great

706
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,279
certainly thank you for the email thank

707
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,840
you

708
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,159
okay thank you donald i think we can go

709
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,039
to the next

710
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,840
thank you stephanie

711
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
um so i'm going to be presenting

712
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,799
basically a brief update on two drafts

713
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,480
uh defining load balancing modes for

714
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
ethernet segments

715
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,960
i believe to be honest that stefan

716
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,720
covered most of my update in the chair

717
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,360
report

718
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,399
uh so i can be very brief and uh yield

719
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,919
most of my time back to the looking

720
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,600
group

721
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,880
uh so the first one is the productive

722
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,760
load balancing mode so this is a draft

723
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,240
which

724
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,000
has progressed some five or six versions

725
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,760
with the working group feedback before

726
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
adoption

727
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,640
and even though this is just a

728
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,760
zero one version it is a relatively

729
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,240
mature working group draft

730
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,200
uh with multi-vendor support uh and

731
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
adoption

732
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,440
uh of several known implementations by

733
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,080
service providers

734
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,520
and um in our views it's uh

735
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
since it's a mature draft and it's the

736
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,200
board active is beginning to be referred

737
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,240
to

738
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
uh in other individual drafts and

739
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,480
discussions as

740
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,799
a third baseline gold balancing mode we

741
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,600
believe it is

742
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,279
uh ready for a last call

743
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,279
but obviously any feedback is is still

744
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,679
welcome

745
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,840
next slide stefan

746
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,039
so the gateway protocol draft has been

747
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,440
around for some time also

748
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,600
this is a load balancing mode that

749
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,120
addresses common

750
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,559
migration scenarios for service

751
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,879
providers with legacy access networks

752
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,600
there have been incremental updates

753
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,039
based on working group

754
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,399
feedback for each of these six versions

755
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,720
and this sixth version is no exception

756
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,559
it incorporates somewhere within group

757
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,480
feedback also

758
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,440
um it is still an individual draft but

759
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,399
it is mature

760
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,880
uh it has actually implementations and

761
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,799
deployments it is deployed

762
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,799
uh so we do believe the draft is ready

763
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,320
for an option

764
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,799
uh but here also uh more comments are of

765
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,918
course always welcome

766
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,519
that would be it for me stefan on those

767
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,279
two drafts

768
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,559
okay i don't see anyone um

769
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,120
in the queue i would like to uh

770
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
understand from the group

771
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,960
uh who has read uh the draft and who

772
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,640
thinks it could be ready for a working

773
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
group adoption

774
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,799
so i will start for the first time i

775
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,320
will uh

776
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,360
a show of hands tool

777
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,440
so you can you can reply okay

778
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,840
let me try to do that

779
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,840
oh sorry i have put it the right the

780
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,200
wrong draft name

781
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
so yeah i'm talking about the evpn l2

782
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,880
gateway proto

783
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,000
and please raise your hand if you think

784
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
that the document is ready for working

785
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,440
hope adoption

786
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,360
keep in mind you have to click on the

787
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,039
tool in the upper right to be able to do

788
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,720
this

789
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,360
thank you donald

okay we got very very few reply for now

791
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:39,840
okay let's wait for 10 more seconds

792
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,639
okay thank you for your feedback

793
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,840
okay next speaker is lucas

794
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,720
hello stefan and hello everyone

795
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,200
first we can hear you can you guys hear

796

yep

798
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,639
all right this is lucas krodiger from

799
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,320
cisco um

800
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,239
presenting for the first time here in

801
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,520
the best working group

802
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,800
the evpn interoperability modes

803
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,918
uh draft we we worked on that

804
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,040
for quite some time um over the

805
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,159
um over the last two years or so as

806
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,199
as a conjunction of multiple

807
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
people across multiple vendor and thanks

808
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,879
a lot for my co-authors

809
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,359
for all the input and also for all the

810
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,199
rest in the working group

811
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,839
you want to go to the next slide

812
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
so the the idea behind this or or the

813
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,960
broader spectrum is that we have

814
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,079
different

815
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,119
um modes in various

816
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,079
evpn drafts for example in service

817
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,440
interface we have a section 6 in rfc

818
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,760
7432

819
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,119
which defines the different

820
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,320
service interface modes we have irb

821
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,200
draft which defines two different

822
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,040
forwarding modes there and we have the

823
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,960
irb core connectivity as part of the

824
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,480
prefix advertisement

825
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,800
so in in all of these different um

826
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
drafts and rfcs

827
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,280
we have different use cases defined and

828
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,839
with different use cases we have

829
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,160
different

830
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,960
modes of operation there which are

831
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,680
generally

832
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,440
mutual exclusive um as they are divine

833
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,560
defined in there but as as we saw

834
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
given that not everything is really a

835
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,880
must for implementation

836
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,920
and very often it becomes that some of

837
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,880
these use cases

838
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,760
are adjacent to each other there there

839
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,079
is

840
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,640
the critically criticality for

841
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,000
interoperability

842
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,839
between them next slide please

843
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,359
so the key focus uh on this draft is

844
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,160
in the area of service interfaces

845
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,440
integrated by the bridge and irb core

846
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,560
connectivity uh model

847
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,270
so we we aim in this draft to um

848
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,560
[Music]

849
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
achieve interoperability between these

850
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,720
different defined modes and

851
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,320
we don't really want to redefine

852
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,240
all of these different functions which

853
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,920
are present in the various drafts and

854
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,800
rfcs

855
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,359
but we want to make sure that there is a

856
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,240
clear

857
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,040
mode of operation documented and defined

858
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,160
in how these

859
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,200
um different modes can interoperate to

860
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,160
each other

861
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,040
um given that there are there is a vast

862
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,720
amount of

863
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
variations there um i think there are

864
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,160
three or four

865
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,359
in the nrc7432 there's only two

866
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,920
in the irv draft but there are three

867
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,640
then in the

868
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,280
um prefix advertisement draft so we we

869
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,160
look at the most

870
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,118
uh pertinent uh modes uh we can always

871
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,640
look at the uh interoperability between

872
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,640
v vlan of air bundle

873
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,920
and vlan based the service interface in

874
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
rfc 7432

875
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,359
the asymmetric irb and the symmetry guy

876
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,040
rb the slow 2

877
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,440
irb modes which we have in the inter

878
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,320
subnet

879
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,560
draft and then the irb core connectivity

880
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,400
model we look at the interface less at

881
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,640
the interface full unnumbered mode

882
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,440
next slide please

883
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,079
so this is a short overview of section

884
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,359
3.2

885
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,400
of the draft itself meaning the

886
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,320
interoperability of the two service

887
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,520
interfaces

888
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
you see on the very left hand side you

889
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,440
see a vlan of air bundle service

890
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,240
pe you see on the right hand side a vlan

891
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,520
based

892
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,839
service interface pe and in the

893
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,440
traditional mode which you see

894
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,720
on the top uh left with vd1 vd6

895
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,760
in green within mac vrf2 of p1

896
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,000
you see how normally you would advertise

897
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
these bundled pe

898
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,960
uh bundled pd's uh within their

899
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960
the classic uh multiple bds per evi

900
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
uh the eve attack information there and

901
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,079
the common route

902
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,359
target for the whole mcref when it comes

903
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,200
to vlan based we have different

904
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,960
attributes which are required for

905
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,720
example we don't

906
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,760
care or we don't want the ethernet

907
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,520
attack to be present there so in order

908
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,880
to interpret

909
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,119
we ask in this specific model on pe one

910
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,320
to go into a single dd per evi mode with

911
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,760
a clear route target

912
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,960
for the automatic vrf design and sending

913
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
with an if attack of zero how the vln

914
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
based mode actually would also define it

915
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,920
there

916
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,320
so it's kind of a hybrid uh for the v

917
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,640
for the service interface on pe one

918
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,680
it has a set of uh vds which are

919
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,520
operating

920
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,200
um with air mode versus it has

921
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,160
other uh mac vrfs or other bds which are

922
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,839
operating in the vlan based mode to

923
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,680
achieve that interoperability

924
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,400
between the two different service

925
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,040
interfaces

926
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
next slide please

927
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,560
um section 4.2 specifically and section

928
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
4

929
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,880
overall is focusing on the irb

930
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,760
uh interoperability we look there at the

931
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,560
asymmetric irb to symmetric irb

932
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,200
we defined on what is actually required

933
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,920
from the asymmetric irb to be sent

934
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,119
that symmetric irb or hybrid irb mode

935
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,079
here in p2

936
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,560
represented would be able to achieve

937
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
communication

938
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,040
we define them as advertising the mac ip

939
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,880
routes from the asymmetric irb as it's

940
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,240
traditionally being there

941
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,200
but then the install of the specifics on

942
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,320
the symmetric irb

943
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,000
we would put in by basically

944
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,599
um allowing the the uh mpls label one as

945
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,359
well as the mac ip bindings to be

946
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,240
installed

947
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,119
uh over the l2 tunnel um on the pe 2 we

948
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,040
also anticipate that there might be

949
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,079
other

950
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,400
non other pes which are non

951
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,800
interoperable with the asymmetric irbs

952
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,119
so we would allow that symmetric irb to

953
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,079
symmetric irb

954
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,920
to stay existing

955
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,160
um next slide

956
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,920
um the last section or the last area of

957
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,520
interoperability is around

958
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,680
section five which is the irb core

959
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,119
connectivity modes

960
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,880
um you see here on the left hand side

961
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,400
the interface less model

962
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
you see on the right hand side p2 the

963
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,720
interface full unnumbered model

964
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,720
so here again we are defining on what is

965
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
being needed in order to get

966
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,560
interoperability between these different

967
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,680
connectivity modes

968
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,520
we see the interface full unnumbered irb

969
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,760
requires an additional mac ip routes

970
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,240
to define or to do create the recursions

971
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,880
for

972
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,359
for the next stop there which interface

973
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,079
less doesn't

974
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,359
need so we ask the interface less pe to

975
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,280
advertise an additional mac ip route

976
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,359
with the respective information there

977
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,960
uh respectively uh p2 to evaluate that

978
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,200
and in the other direction for the

979
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,440
interface for unnumbered irb

980
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,560
we have that implicit advertisement of

981
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,240
the additional mac ip route so we will

982
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,200
ignore that

983
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,680
on the interface left side as defined in

984
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,480
the

985
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:35,839
in the section 5.1 next slide

986
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,760
so status of the draft said we submitted

987
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,160
uh

988
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,359
first in july 2019 we did a lot of

989
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,280
field work prior to that we're currently

990
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,720
in version zero three

991
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
there's a version before which we are

992
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,560
going to do with some minor updates and

993
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,240
hopefully with a lot of feedbacks from

994
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,839
the working group itself

995
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,599
um we have actually implementation at

996
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,960
various stages

997
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,839
at various vendors we did some active

998
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,880
testing

999
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,200
with juniper nokia and cisco juniper

1000
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,000
nokia

1001
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,400
as part of the multi-vendor

1002
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,599
interoperability

1003
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,599
showcase at entc um it went over various

1004
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,400
years and it's it was always aimed at

1005
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,760
the least amount of

1006
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,440
need from another implementation meaning

1007
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,599
one of the other service interfaces or

1008
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,040
irb modes or

1009
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,440
irb connectivity modes are there for

1010
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,280
achieving the interoperability on the

1011
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,920
side

1012
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,160
of the other vendor next time please

1013
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,880
so with this what we achieved for

1014
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,680
example the

1015
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,520
service interface interoperability we

1016
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,960
did vlan based

1017
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,839
on a cisco pe and we had the juniper

1018
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,000
villain of air bundle uh implementation

1019
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,319
there and did interoperability there

1020
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,319
uh thanks a lot for all the help there

1021
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,160
uh from from various people

1022
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,480
uh from from juniper during this entc

1023
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,359
event

1024
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,079
we actually also did the irb

1025
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,440
interoperability

1026
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,200
was very interesting because at that

1027
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,880
point the

1028
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,800
implementation of the cisco symmetric

1029
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,960
irb was kind of

1030
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,680
seamless or let's call it hidden to

1031
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,640
everyone else

1032
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,960
and we achieved with juniper the

1033
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,880
asymmetric irb implementation as well as

1034
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,800
a couple of other vendors

1035
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,280
irb core connectivity we we do that

1036
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,119
interoperability testing for

1037
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,599
for a couple of years now to get with

1038
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,280
nokia which has the interface full on

1039
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,640
numbered implementation

1040
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,599
so we achieved already a very good set

1041
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,079
of

1042
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,160
interoperability as this guy discussed

1043
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,839
in the draft itself

1044
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,480
and have implementations there in order

1045
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,760
to achieve this

1046
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,280
next slide please

1047
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,319
so as we are here um at itf 110

1048
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,960
online we asking for working group

1049
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,599
adoption

1050
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,800
and also for feedback from the working

1051
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,200
group

1052
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,920
from the community on this strategy

1053
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,160
thank you very much

1054
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:00,000
okay when you have a question

1055
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,920
because i have a one question one

1056
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,640
comment

1057
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,680
first question is about

1058
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,920
symmetric and asthmatic irb support

1059
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,200
for the p support symmetric

1060
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,480
irb what it will be the

1061
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,920
it's a folding behavior when it does the

1062
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,440
intersecting routing

1063
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,040
is going to do layer 2 eventually do

1064
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,400
layer 2 forwarding to p1

1065
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,880
that that is correct when we would do

1066
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,839
layer 2 forwarding to

1067
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,160
pe one post routing on ingress on the

1068
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,599
asymmetric side

1069
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,119
that is in one direction in the other

1070
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,040
direction we would do exactly the same

1071
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:43,760
would actually

1072
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,680
behave kind of an asymmetric

1073
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,119
irb pe on the symmetric irbp

1074
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,640
side so kind of a hybrid at that point

1075
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,520
yeah thank you so will be it'll be nice

1076
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,240
to

1077
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,280
spell out in the draft so because um

1078
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,280
if p support uh symmetric iob

1079
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,000
can behave that you know they to support

1080
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,880
this draft

1081
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,000
they change the code yeah okay okay

1082
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,119
very good thank you very much for the

1083
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,040
feedback yeah so

1084
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,240
yeah uh as a comment is about uh

1085
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,359
vlan aware and the vdm

1086
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,839
bundle service uh vm based on the video

1087
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,839
aware bundle service

1088
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,720
and i think the draft said the video and

1089
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,160
our bundle service

1090
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,200
must have one billion

1091
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,920
only one bridge domain for video where

1092
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,119
bundle service usually

1093
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,920
people choose this service interface

1094
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,319
service mode they have a multiple vlan

1095
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,680
inside mac roof i think

1096
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,480
it is a option to support

1097
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,599
bd aware route target because the route

1098
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,880
target is the key

1099
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,280
for the interrupt between two service

1100
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,400
modes

1101
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,040
so i would suggest to remove the

1102
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,520
keyboard you must also maybe consider

1103
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,280
support the interrupt with vlan aware

1104
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,760
bundle service with more than one bridge

1105
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,880
doorman

1106
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,200
and then require each british domain to

1107
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,359
have um

1108
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,119
eddie specifically so maybe we can talk

1109
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,640
offline on that if

1110
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,599
there is anything missing or that sure

1111
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:26,240
absolutely

1112
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,079
absolutely when we can we can discuss

1113
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,920
that online offline as well

1114
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,319
um one one comment i would like to make

1115
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,200
is that

1116
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,960
in signaling to a vlan based

1117
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,359
pe you require not only the

1118
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,599
media of air route target at that point

1119
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,119
you would also

1120
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,359
need to ensure that you're not

1121
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:48,400
advertising

1122
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,319
the east attack identifier to be

1123
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,319
different than zero

1124
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,319
yes you could ignore it on the receive

1125
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,000
side but it would be

1126
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,800
better to have clear signalization that

1127
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,119
this

1128
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,160
is a single um bd

1129
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:05,359
per evi mode at that point and the

1130
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,520
clarity on the route target if

1131
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,760
if the sending side meaning the the vlan

1132
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,560
of erp

1133
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,160
would send it in the in the proper

1134
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,200
format uh to the demand-based one but

1135
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,119
uh from from the rest what you mentioned

1136
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,960
that sounds absolutely fair and i'm

1137
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,880
happy to discuss that

1138
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,280
thank you yeah absolutely thank you very

1139
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,160
much man

1140
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,280
yeah it's a very useful document thanks

1141
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,760
a lot

1142
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,680
i'm i'm remembering back when we did the

1143
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,880
testing together

1144
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,280
between vlan and air and villain base

1145
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,240
yeah

1146
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,599
thanks thank you

1147
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,319
okay thank you lucas thank you very much

1148
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,520
dj you are the next one

1149
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,200
hello can you hear me yeah absolutely

1150
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,240
okay great ah thank you uh hello

1151
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:52,960
everyone

1152
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,480
i am dhananjay rao from cisco and i will

1153
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,319
present on behalf of my co-authors and

1154
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,520
contributors

1155
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,640
i have two drafts to present first the

1156
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,240
bgp colorado routing

1157
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,440
problem statement draft followed by a

1158
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,440
solution proposal

1159
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,160
next slide please

1160
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,640
uh the objective of bjp colorado routing

1161
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,920
is to use bgp

1162
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,559
to establish an end-to-end intent aware

1163
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:21,040
path

1164
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,440
across multiple domains domains could be

1165
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,079
igp

1166
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,920
or vgp based um the word intent is a bit

1167
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,800
abstract

1168
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,599
but a simple example is uh you know a

1169
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,800
low latency path

1170
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,720
between our two ps in a network

1171
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,439
next slide please

1172
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,640
a quick reminder here in the ietf we

1173
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,000
have defined a solution

1174
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,400
for inter domain intent or sla aware

1175
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,440
path computation

1176
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,640
using srte it is a mature widely

1177
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,760
deployed and supported

1178
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,480
solution uh the solution documented in

1179
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,599
this draft

1180
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,880
uh defines the notion of color

1181
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,359
to represent intent in the network

1182
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:04,480
control plane

1183
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,440
uh next slide please

1184
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,960
uh here we see an illustration of the

1185
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,800
color concept in action

1186
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,200
an egress pe e3 tags a vpn route

1187
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,640
with color c1 expressing a request for a

1188
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
particular intent for that route

1189
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,839
any ingress pe such as e1 that installs

1190
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:26,800
this route

1191
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,200
will look for a path to e3 for that

1192
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,319
color

1193
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,640
the color here is signaled using the bgp

1194
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,960
color extended community

1195
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,920
next slide please

1196
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,040
now in the srt solution

1197
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,800
the ingress p even may request an sr pce

1198
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,480
that's in the domain to compute the

1199
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,920
inter domain path

1200
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,559
since the srpc will be aware of the the

1201
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,160
interdomain topology

1202
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,520
uh the srpc will return a label or a set

1203
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,240
stack

1204
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,000
which the pe will install and use in the

1205
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,400
data plane uh the rest of the network

1206
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,079
doesn't have any state for this

1207
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,119
path uh here we could say you know e3

1208
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,760
comma c1 is our policy based colorware

1209
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,319
path

1210
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:15,279
in the underlay next slide please

1211
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,480
so we see here an evolution of that

1212
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,920
automated steering

1213
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,359
as the previous case but here uh the

1214
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,400
the inter-domain path is set up using

1215
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,720
bgp hop by hop route distribution and

1216
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,400
best path computation

1217
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,520
uh in this example a route to e3 for

1218
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,119
color c1

1219
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,319
is originated from a border router

1220
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,760
say node 32 origin may be originated

1221
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,960
from an igp

1222
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
and it is propagated hop by hop across

1223
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,800
the domain until it reaches e1

1224
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,640
at each hop a best path is computed

1225
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,800
which may recurse over um you know intra

1226
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,200
domain color well paths

1227
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,800
the vpn route in this case uh is tiered

1228
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,079
via this bgp color aware route uh

1229
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,839
you know to e3 e3 comma c1

1230
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,680
next slide please

1231
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,760
um here we see an example where there

1232
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,040
are uh

1233
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,960
you know multiple so two color aware

1234
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,480
routes to e3

1235
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,920
uh e3 comma c1 and e3 comma c2

1236
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,400
uh which are independent routes that may

1237
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,160
result by our different igp paths in

1238
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,040
each domain

1239
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,960
and yield completely different

1240
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,240
end-to-end paths

1241
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,520
uh and we see you know two vpn routes um

1242
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,880
one tagged with uh color c1 which will

1243
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,160
resolve via uh you know the

1244
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,599
e3 comma c1 route and the other

1245
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,839
uh w slash w which is stacked with uh

1246
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,160
color c2 which will resolve via

1247
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,280
uh the uh e3 comma c2 route

1248
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,880
next slide please

1249
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,960
so when we look at the problem statement

1250
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
we you know consider some of the basic

1251
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,839
parameters

1252
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,880
of the target deployments um

1253
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,040
the the reference topologies are you

1254
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,079
know the well-known

1255
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,520
ones but we observe um you know

1256
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,400
a vast increase in the scale of the

1257
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,599
network

1258
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,119
um in in some cases to the order of a

1259
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:13,920
few hundred

1260
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,960
thousand you know nodes in the network

1261
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,960
and then we also see you know a number

1262
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,960
of intents that needs to be

1263
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,680
you know may need to be supported uh we

1264
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,119
listed some you know

1265
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,240
common ones so even considering um

1266
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,800
just these examples there's like five

1267
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,000
intents with

1268
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,280
around 300k nodes we end up with up to a

1269
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,440
1.5 million routes in the network

1270
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,319
and that has some significant impact on

1271
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,359
um you know on

1272
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,119
the protocol and that's what we consider

1273
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,640
in the draft next slide please

1274
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,000
uh here um

1275
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,040
yeah we'll just list a few more intent

1276
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,000
use cases uh for you know reference uh

1277
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,920
the draft goes into more detail

1278
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,680
with the you know with topology and

1279
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,759
illustrations uh next slide please

1280
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,640
uh the primary focus of the problem

1281
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,920
statement draft has been to

1282
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,280
you know document a concise technical

1283
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,800
analysis and enumeration

1284
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,559
of the use cases with illustrations

1285
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,800
with a specific focus on the deployment

1286
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,000
considerations

1287
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,160
and the resulting protocol design

1288
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,040
requirements

1289
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,160
for for bgp a few key aspects

1290
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,760
to call out here is of course

1291
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,760
consistency with deployed

1292
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,400
solutions that's the srpc based solution

1293
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,839
uh here we again call out

1294
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,680
uh you know the use of color to drive

1295
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,599
automated uh steering

1296
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,880
uh we also realized um the

1297
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,440
problem scope is wider uh than just the

1298
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,319
transport

1299
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,480
uh intent aware paths may need to be

1300
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,800
supported in the vpn service layer

1301
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,800
uh you know based on the feedback we you

1302
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,400
know received

1303
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,760
both uh you know between say ce to ce

1304
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,800
across the

1305
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,079
provider in a core but also beyond

1306
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,559
and and as well because a provider

1307
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,079
network is also made up of

1308
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,280
uh different administrative uh authority

1309
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:09,760
you know

1310
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,480
domains if you will um there isn't

1311
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,160
there's a there's a presence of

1312
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,079
various interworking options like

1313
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,000
interest option a and option b

1314
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,079
and this intent awareness needs to be

1315
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,319
you know propagated across them too

1316
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,200
similarly a support for nfe and service

1317
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:25,839
chain uh

1318
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:28,960
integration is also uh necessary

1319
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,240
next slide please um

1320
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:35,599
there's uh also a list of deployment

1321
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,760
requirements noted uh you know a key one

1322
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,200
to call out here is

1323
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,680
the fact that a multi-domain network is

1324
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,559
heterogeneous

1325
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,000
has different technologies and

1326
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,240
encapsulations and these need to be

1327
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,119
considered when

1328
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,319
you know defining the protocol

1329
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,160
extensions

1330
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,400
um also uh you know going back to my

1331
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,520
example about

1332
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,799
the scale um that has an impact

1333
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,880
uh on all the nodes in the network both

1334
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,640
on the data plane especially when

1335
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,760
you know mpls uh you know is uh

1336
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,960
you know implemented or used as well as

1337
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,400
on the control plane with you know bgp

1338
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:10,880
and

1339
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,599
again we list the considerations in the

1340
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,920
draft

1341
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,799
next slide please

1342
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,440
um so this work is uh you know the

1343
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,400
result of a

1344
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,200
collaboration with many folks uh you

1345
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,760
know both

1346
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,559
among uh the operators and vendors and

1347
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,680
we thank the folks for

1348
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,160
uh their you know contributions uh we

1349
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,680
also recognize that there has been work

1350
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,559
in this area

1351
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,640
specifically by the co-authors of the

1352
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,599
seamless sr

1353
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,240
draft uh we reached out to them uh you

1354
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,240
know back in november december

1355
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,000
to work towards a joint uh in our effort

1356
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
jim utaro has helped facilitate these

1357
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,200
discussions

1358
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,359
uh we published our technical analysis

1359
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:52,480
you know towards this

1360
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,000
uh effort the seamless sr co-authors uh

1361
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,520
you know have acknowledged our feedback

1362
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,960
and split their document

1363
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,680
uh into two we we are working together

1364
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,079
now

1365
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,440
to uh you know work towards a joint

1366
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,559
you know set of uh new documents uh next

1367
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,040
slide please

1368
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,960
um so the so this work is ongoing uh but

1369
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,319
you know we welcome

1370
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:18,400
uh feedback and you know review from the

1371
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,280
working group uh

1372
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,400
so let's stop here for a minute do we

1373
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,440
have any comment

1374
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,839
regarding this problem statement

1375
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:30,559
document

1376
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,799
i don't see anyone in the queue

1377
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,319
so we can move forward dj okay sounds

1378
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:38,720
good

1379
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,160
stefan um so so we now move uh

1380
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,799
to the uh you know to the solution uh

1381
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,680
proposal

1382
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,640
uh next slide please

1383
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,400
so from the problem statement analysis

1384
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,559
it's clear to us that we need a new

1385
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:57,040
you know bgp safy uh for the ability to

1386
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,960
signal multiple routes

1387
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,599
to the same endpoint prefix you know one

1388
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:02,079
per

1389
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,520
color uh with that the solution draft

1390
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,079
uh describes the essential elements that

1391
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:09,920
are needed uh

1392
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,440
focusing on the aspects listed below uh

1393
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,680
i think to highlight here is we have

1394
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,200
focused on

1395
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,640
because it is a new safety we have

1396
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,720
focused on defining

1397
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,440
extensions that provide efficiency and

1398
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,799
extensibility

1399
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,599
and improve upon some of the legacy uh

1400
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:28,960
constraints we have

1401
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,599
you know seen in the past uh next slide

1402
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,920
please

1403
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,200
um so yeah so the the

1404
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,040
we start with the nlri i mean this is

1405
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,960
you know the critical element

1406
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,359
um the nlri key we propose to be

1407
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,000
endpoint

1408
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,799
comma color uh where endpoint is the uh

1409
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,160
you know the ip prefix

1410
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,240
of the uh you know the traffic

1411
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,680
destination in the

1412
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,599
in the in the transport that's uh say

1413
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:56,880
the pe address

1414
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,799
and then color is the same 32-bit value

1415
00:57:58,799 --> 00:57:59,920
that's used

1416
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,799
you know by sr policy the color here

1417
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,720
serves two purposes

1418
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,319
it distinguishes the route uh per intent

1419
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:10,640
and it also indicates the intent that is

1420
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,400
satisfied by the route

1421
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,520
right this color is defined by the user

1422
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,319
and it's uh consistent on all the

1423
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,280
devices

1424
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,760
within uh you know network managed by an

1425
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,280
administrative authority

1426
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,559
a so-called color domain if you will

1427
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,680
um and of course this color is as

1428
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,920
mentioned earlier the same as the bgp

1429
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,440
color external community

1430
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,839
uh next slide please

1431
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,359
um why did we you know propose this

1432
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,079
particular

1433
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,040
uh data model uh it's you know it's the

1434
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:45,760
simplest

1435
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,880
it's the most precise it has

1436
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,440
you know identical semantics uh you know

1437
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,079
as the one

1438
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,280
used for sr policy

1439
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,720
uh automatically providing consistency

1440
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,400
the routing semantics that follow from

1441
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,359
it are quite simple and straightforward

1442
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,880
and they're essentially the same as

1443
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,480
used for the bgp ip safi or

1444
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,680
the bgp you know labeled unicast safi

1445
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,160
uh the simplicity has benefits both in

1446
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,160
the protocol processing

1447
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,480
as well as in operationally for folks

1448
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,400
who run the network

1449
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,200
a key benefit it inherently provides

1450
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,400
ecmp aware

1451
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,200
and you know backup paths at every hop

1452
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,400
you know

1453
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,440
for example if there were two

1454
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,520
you know route to ap originated from two

1455
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,480
abrs

1456
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,559
they automatically become multiple parts

1457
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:40,319
of the e-commerce c prefix

1458
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,520
at an ingress node in that domain

1459
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,839
this leads to a faster localized

1460
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,520
convergence within the domain driven by

1461
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,799
igp

1462
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,880
you know detection

1463
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,920
and also uh you know prevents this

1464
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:56,480
failure

1465
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,319
from creating churn you know beyond the

1466
00:59:58,319 --> 00:59:59,760
domain

1467
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,119
and of course it's also the most

1468
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:03,680
efficient from a subscription or a

1469
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,079
you know filtering point of view as

1470
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,839
needed for the automated

1471
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:12,480
steering next slide please

1472
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,640
the other aspect we consider is the

1473
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,839
encapsulation

1474
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:18,799
um we you know the there is a need for

1475
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:20,799
multiple encapsulations even within a

1476
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:21,680
domain

1477
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,200
uh for coexistence and migration from

1478
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,440
one technology to the other

1479
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,839
and we want to allow that the necessary

1480
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:30,559
signaling

1481
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,119
to be done efficiently and operationally

1482
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,079
simpler

1483
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,760
uh so we use uh in non-key tlvs

1484
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,240
to signal uh the different encapsulation

1485
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,040
you know data

1486
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,799
for for a route we also

1487
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:47,200
um in terms of encoding plays the you

1488
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
know variable part in the nlri the rest

1489
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,559
in the attribute

1490
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,119
the goal again being efficient packing

1491
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,319
of the bgp

1492
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:57,440
updates uh since this is a new safy uh

1493
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,960
you know there is the opportunity to

1494
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,359
address some of the limitations uh that

1495
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,760
exists in the current um you know

1496
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,720
safeties

1497
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,799
uh next slide please

1498
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,040
um extending on that same uh theme of

1499
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,480
extensibility

1500
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,160
uh we also define uh an extensible nlri

1501
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,520
uh in a model here um the details are in

1502
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,200
the draft of course uh but

1503
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,400
just to as a quick intro uh we

1504
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,200
encode a route type um you know to

1505
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,119
account for newer use cases that may you

1506
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:31,599
know come

1507
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,640
in future we encode a key length

1508
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,000
to allow um new route types to be

1509
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,640
uh opaquely you know transited through

1510
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,119
uh transport rrs in the network

1511
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,680
um and we already you know test upon the

1512
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:49,040
use of non-ktlvs for the encapsulations

1513
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,119
uh we recognize there you know there are

1514
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:52,319
other ways to

1515
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,839
encode uh this data and you know uh

1516
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,240
we look forward to feedback uh but we

1517
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,160
have taken a considered

1518
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,359
you know first step at it uh next

1519
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,799
next slide please

1520
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,319
um we we reuse and leverage the aigp

1521
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,880
attribute uh to convey the end to end

1522
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,599
metric

1523
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,960
for uh in a specific color um

1524
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,799
and again you know aigp being an

1525
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:20,720
extensible attribute

1526
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,200
we see you know scenarios where it can

1527
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,200
be extended to accommodate certain use

1528
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,880
cases

1529
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,839
next next slide please

1530
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,640
coming to the bgp car route validation

1531
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,520
and resolution you know both i mean at

1532
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,319
every hop

1533
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:41,680
uh um this this is

1534
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,839
you know the the essentially the

1535
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,839
processing of the next hob

1536
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:48,960
a a bgp car next hop will

1537
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,440
resolve by default over another color

1538
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,799
aware path

1539
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,559
that's present in the domain that could

1540
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,359
be an igp path or it could be

1541
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:00,799
also another bgp path when that color is

1542
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,079
not available

1543
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,680
um the the resolution may happen via

1544
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,880
a different color uh you know a

1545
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,359
path that is available in the domain or

1546
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,200
in the worst case it may fall back to

1547
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,480
uh the default uh best effort path

1548
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,319
this uh this model also allows for

1549
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,000
preserving the end-to-end color

1550
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,079
awareness even if

1551
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,079
um that a transit domain actually does

1552
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,319
not support color so it allows a way to

1553
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:28,799
get

1554
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:32,960
even get support over um islands such as

1555
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,160
you know igp ldp best effort islands as

1556
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:36,799
well as

1557
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:40,480
bgplu uh you know domains

1558
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,880
um we also propose to use the the

1559
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,400
encapsulation

1560
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,160
uh you know after validating its

1561
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,000
presence in our programming in the data

1562
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,039
plane

1563
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,559
and this validation can be augmented by

1564
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,839
uh a dynamic performance measurement uh

1565
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:58,880
you know system

1566
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,160
where you know needed uh a second aspect

1567
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,079
from a resolution point of view yeah as

1568
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,119
i said earlier

1569
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,280
the resolution is recursive so it can

1570
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,319
happen via

1571
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:12,000
you know any available uh bgp or igp

1572
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,799
uh mechanisms uh next slide please

1573
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,680
um this is you know a callback to

1574
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,319
the service route automated steering

1575
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,079
steering that we noted in the

1576
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,440
uh problem statement uh is just

1577
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,480
indicating the um you know the vpn route

1578
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,960
in this case as it you know when it

1579
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,400
resolves over a bgp

1580
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,880
color aware route uh there can be other

1581
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,599
options

1582
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,079
you know it could be a combination you

1583
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,400
have multiple options bgp card sr policy

1584
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,280
igpfa

1585
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,599
and based on the preference uh the

1586
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:48,400
appropriate

1587
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,160
path end-to-end path would be you know

1588
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,240
selected uh again

1589
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,319
you know given the presence of multiple

1590
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:55,520
you know domains with different

1591
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,440
encapsulations an end-to-end path

1592
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,039
may have to go over different

1593
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,880
encapsulations

1594
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,599
um next uh slide please

1595
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,960
um so here we come to the case um albeit

1596
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,319
a corner case

1597
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,720
where the transport network has to

1598
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,400
traverse across uh

1599
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,920
you know different color domains that is

1600
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,760
domains where the color to intent

1601
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,119
mappings uh

1602
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,240
actually change now this is not expected

1603
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:22,880
to be the

1604
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,520
common case usually if the network goes

1605
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,319
across such

1606
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,400
different administrative authority

1607
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,480
boundaries it is likely that there is a

1608
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,599
vpn layer

1609
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,359
you know interworking that is used like

1610
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,039
in race option a or b

1611
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:37,440
but for the case where a transport may

1612
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,240
extend

1613
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,440
we define a uh you know a solution

1614
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,960
uh using an extended community to carry

1615
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,559
the local color mapping across such a

1616
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,520
boundary

1617
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,079
such that this color then can get

1618
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,799
remapped

1619
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,359
to the receiving domains uh in a local

1620
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,079
color

1621
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,559
and used within the domain a key thing

1622
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,079
to note here is the

1623
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,720
the nlri of the power route itself is

1624
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,440
not

1625
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,240
rewritten it is preserved end to end the

1626
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,280
other thing is that

1627
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,920
as noted earlier the prefix is unique in

1628
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,319
the

1629
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,520
in the underlay network uh hence the

1630
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,799
e comma c tuple is unique even if

1631
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,079
c is local to a color uh

1632
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,880
next slide please

1633
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:25,119
so um it can be noted uh you know from

1634
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,839
the draft that the bgp protocol

1635
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:30,319
extensions itself themselves are you

1636
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,079
know quite uh

1637
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,319
you know simple but the complexity

1638
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:36,400
really comes from the the scaling

1639
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,960
uh you know requirement and so we

1640
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,079
analyze

1641
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,160
uh the impact of scaling on both the

1642
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,000
data plane and the control plane

1643
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,319
on the data plane side we note the use

1644
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,440
of you know

1645
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,160
a few different designs uh and we

1646
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:50,960
analyze

1647
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,680
the benefits of those design you know on

1648
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,440
taking state away from the core

1649
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,760
border routers for example but with the

1650
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,000
resulting you know complexity at

1651
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,599
other points in the network such as the

1652
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,400
ingress pe or the border router

1653
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,119
and the same thing you know for for the

1654
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,960
control plane

1655
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,720
um next next slide please

1656
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,680
okay um yeah so so this is uh you know

1657
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,039
obviously the initial

1658
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:19,920
version um but we welcome uh you know

1659
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:20,720
feedback

1660
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,839
from the working group

1661
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:28,880
all right you are in the queue go ahead

1662
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,480
hey uh dj um thanks for the presentation

1663
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:32,960
i

1664
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,720
have two questions uh about it

1665
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,760
the first one um so in the uh

1666
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,520
the new nlri you are

1667
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,760
you're including the uh uh prototype and

1668
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,920
also the uh the key length

1669
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,720
and you mentioned that allows uh raw

1670
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,079
reflectors to

1671
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:55,200
basically validate the key length and

1672
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,680
protect the router then if the the road

1673
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,200
type is unknown

1674
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,880
yes uh that is uh that is a bit new

1675
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,240
compared to what we do

1676
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,280
uh with safies that support route types

1677
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,440
in the sense that today uh for those

1678
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:10,400
saffies

1679
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,880
bra reflectors if they don't know about

1680
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,160
a given route type they

1681
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,359
usually do three dots withdraw as per

1682
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,479
uh xc7606 uh

1683
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,560
don't you think that this new behavior

1684
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,640
is kind of a

1685
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,359
security risk or at least this should be

1686
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,080
discussed

1687
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,960
in the security section we should

1688
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:31,520
certainly

1689
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,640
discuss uh that i think the the the the

1690
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,960
behavior you note for the exiting safies

1691
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,439
i mean that is something that has driven

1692
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:41,600
the you know the introduction of this

1693
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,920
um you know this key length because you

1694
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,600
know based on experience of

1695
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,359
introducing new route types for example

1696
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,040
you know with evpn

1697
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,279
um so that's what motivated this but we

1698
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,238
should certainly

1699
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:55,120
discuss the uh the security implications

1700
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,479
uh there are some other

1701
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,560
you know implementation implications as

1702
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,640
well so we would you know certainly

1703
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,640
um analyze them okay cool

1704
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,520
and the the second question is um about

1705
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,560
the the encapsulation part of the an lri

1706
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,640
um so when you add the uh srv6 said

1707
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,839
tld um there's some text in the uh in

1708
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,238
the draft that talks about transposition

1709
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:23,439
that got me completely confused

1710
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:25,359
because there's no no label here right

1711
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,520
so if you if you add the uh

1712
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,399
the service exit tlv directly why would

1713
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,399
you transpose anything

1714
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:34,719
so i don't know if you can clarify that

1715
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:36,719
or maybe it's uh

1716
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,679
i don't know it's uh do the text that's

1717
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:40,719
wrong

1718
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,679
yeah i would i would i would say let me

1719
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,399
take a look

1720
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:46,319
at the text uh you know and then you

1721
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,319
know maybe get back

1722
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:50,399
swedish did you want to add something

1723
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,319
yeah so yeah so like uh

1724
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:53,759
holy holy you are well aware of

1725
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,760
transposes came in vpn

1726
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,960
so it's a similar concept that

1727
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,600
if you have a per prefix you can carry

1728
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:02,000
the

1729
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,400
the function part into the with the nlri

1730
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,080
for bgb packing efficiency and the

1731
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,440
locator and the other part in the

1732
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,159
attribute so

1733
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,679
it's on the similar lines you're well

1734
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:11,920
aware so it's exactly

1735
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,960
the same yeah i know but uh so

1736
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,520
uh yeah i'm i'm aware of it but my my

1737
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,480
point is

1738
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,040
uh here you are starting clean so uh you

1739
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,640
you don't even need to have a

1740
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,199
label in the nlri and then you know we

1741
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,800
won't have uh we will not have a label

1742
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,239
in the nlr where we are

1743
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:30,719
we will carry is in the srv6 sets we are

1744
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:31,520
not as

1745
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,280
if you go into the it's a it's a it's a

1746
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,040
tlvs in which one of them would be the

1747
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,000
sr60 yeah

1748
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,760
in which we'll put the function part of

1749
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,880
the srv6 so

1750
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,159
sure so the tld is part of the uh dnlri

1751
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:44,560
so

1752
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,480
my point is why i mean it's already

1753
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,199
efficient from a packing perspective so

1754
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,600
you don't need any transposition to

1755
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,400
anything

1756
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,159
let's let's discuss part of we can we

1757
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,159
both can discuss this okay

1758
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:58,880
sounds good thank you okay thank you so

1759
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,040
much

1760
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,560
yeah next one is the queue really really

1761
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,040
fast

1762
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:08,000
if you can very quick i just want to

1763
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,600
follow up on the previous comment

1764
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,800
now that i think this is probably a

1765
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,560
comment not just to the authors but also

1766
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,679
for the work group

1767
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,679
um now that we are going to be proposing

1768
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:16,719
uh

1769
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,080
a nlri packing where uh you know there's

1770
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,080
a extended set of information in the key

1771
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,719
so

1772
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,080
somebody needs to take a look at to see

1773
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,280
whether this is the right direction that

1774
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,440
we want to have a nlri grow

1775
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,040
today we are talking about few fields

1776
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,880
and then you know as this progresses

1777
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,440
this may

1778
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:35,199
lead to a very fat nlri something that

1779
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,480
we should take a look at to see whether

1780
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,640
this is the right direction

1781
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,199
a quick comment uh shirley i think i

1782
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,400
think we're talking about the

1783
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,120
you know the non-key tlvs uh but but in

1784
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,960
general yes i think we welcome the

1785
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,239
you know the our discussion on this

1786
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:55,839
okay okay very fast also

1787
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,000
yeah so i um i just want to ask

1788
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,640
a follow-up on the previous question on

1789
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,159
srb6 sid

1790
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,120
so the um

1791
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,920
you know in mpls architecture there is a

1792
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,679
prefix and there is a label so you need

1793
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:12,880
a mapping

1794
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,960
uh from prefix to label and that's why

1795
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,400
you have and an lri

1796
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,600
prefix and and uh and a label

1797
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,480
um i see that you're proposing srv6 sid

1798
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,600
in the encapsulation

1799
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,960
and and what is the uh need for uh

1800
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,360
you know for srv6 which sids which are

1801
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,440
ipv6 prefixes

1802
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,280
why do you really need this kind of a

1803
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,840
mapping from prefix to

1804
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,640
uh if you can clarify that that that

1805
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,280
will be

1806
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,800
uh useful so uh uh

1807
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,800
so as you are aware that sr v6 is

1808
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,080
composed of locator

1809
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,800
and the function in the arguments and we

1810
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,640
can carry a full sr succeed

1811
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,640
or as an encapsulation information or we

1812
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,000
can carry a variable part

1813
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,440
like a function which will change with

1814
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,040
each transport

1815
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,640
so that's what and that's what we want

1816
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:05,840
to carry in the tlb

1817
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,239
yeah it will be useful if you can

1818
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,560
describe that use case and uh

1819
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,280
why we are you are proposing that uh i

1820
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:14,560
think in the future revisions will

1821
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,199
describe sure

1822
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,360
thank you okay you will be the next

1823
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,360
i go you will be the next one but i'm

1824
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,360
really sorry we have to uh we have to

1825
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,960
move forward

1826
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,040
then so we i will close the queue after

1827
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,239
i go

1828
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,679
really really fast few seconds okay

1829
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,560
type go ahead

1830
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,800
hello can't hear me yes good really

1831
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:49,199
really fast

1832
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,040
yeah i think i think it's clear to use

1833
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,000
the enc

1834
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,199
as an key advertising and have a

1835
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,320
question that i say that you also use a

1836
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,760
row type tool

1837
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,719
in the ri so i don't know i want to know

1838
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:05,760
whether we may

1839
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,600
we may define more root types for the uh

1840
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,719
we may use row types to specify

1841
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,080
which type of the encapsulator we may

1842
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,000
use or not

1843
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,920
ah that's a good question i think right

1844
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,199
now the

1845
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,760
approach we have taken is to use you

1846
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,960
know one route type

1847
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,480
and actually signal multiple

1848
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,159
encapsulations on it

1849
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:30,880
that the the option of signaling a

1850
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,520
different

1851
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,360
route type for you know different end

1852
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,120
cap is

1853
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,040
was considered but then that still

1854
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,239
results in

1855
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,640
the advertisement of multiple routes so

1856
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,480
we decided not to do it

1857
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,560
but that's something again you know we

1858
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,120
can discuss

1859
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,159
okay thank you okay okay

1860
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,000
we have to we have to move to the next

1861
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,320
speaker now

1862
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,840
i think you are the next one

1863
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,080
let me open your slides

1864
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,320
hello yeah we can uh we can hear you

1865
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,920
yeah my name is shraddha hagde from

1866
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,920
juniper networks and i

1867
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,320
would like to present seamless sr on

1868
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,520
behalf of my

1869
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,239
co-authors so this draft has been

1870
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,159
presented multiple times in

1871
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:27,199
spring working group

1872
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,799
so next slide please

1873
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,159
so in the initial versions of this draft

1874
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,120
we had

1875
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,520
use cases requirements and the solution

1876
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,239
everything

1877
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:45,600
in one document we got a feedback that

1878
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,800
solution uh there has to be a separate

1879
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,800
requirements and use cases and a

1880
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,199
separate solution document so we

1881
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,440
split this document into two the first

1882
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,320
document

1883
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,199
um it covers the requirements and use

1884
01:15:59,199 --> 01:15:59,840
cases

1885
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,040
uh and it is completely neutral from the

1886
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,960
perspective that it focuses on

1887
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,040
what would be the requirements from from

1888
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:10,800
an operator perspective and what would

1889
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,600
be the

1890
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,520
requirements from deployment perspective

1891
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,080
and it does not refer to any solution or

1892
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:20,080
it does not drive any inspiration

1893
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,640
from the solution space and the second

1894
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,040
document is the solution uh document so

1895
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,719
this document uh

1896
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:28,960
describes how the requirements and use

1897
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,760
cases described in the first document

1898
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,960
will be addressed using a bgp protocol

1899
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,400
extension

1900
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,400
bgp ct that michael lee will present

1901
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,239
later next slide please

1902
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,880
so the basic requirement for seamless sr

1903
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,520
architecture is is a large networks

1904
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,440
uh you know having multiple uh domains

1905
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,120
and you know the requirement is to be

1906
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,000
able to build

1907
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,800
a multiple differentiated paths or

1908
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,880
intent based path

1909
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,080
end to end across these domains

1910
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,880
so seamless sr is is a distributed

1911
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,760
solution

1912
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,800
uh it's

1913
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,080
it you know it's uh the requirement is

1914
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,000
to be able to come up with a distributed

1915
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,600
solution that does not

1916
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,920
use you know there's no single device

1917
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,600
that that would have the

1918
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,159
complete knowledge of the entire

1919
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:32,800
database of the entire network but

1920
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,159
sort of the independent domains will

1921
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:39,679
advertise their reachability and then

1922
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:43,520
stitch them together at the border to

1923
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,760
build an end-to-end path so

1924
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,679
you can think of this as an extension to

1925
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,679
seamless mpls architecture

1926
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,640
in seamless mpls bgplu was mainly used

1927
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,560
which which provided only

1928
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,760
uh best effort path end to end whereas

1929
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,440
in seamless sr it is an enhancement

1930
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:01,840
where

1931
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,080
you can create multiple end-to-end paths

1932
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,679
using bgp based extensions so the first

1933
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:10,719
requirement

1934
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,480
that we want to

1935
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,280
wanted to cover as part of this is is

1936
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,840
you know as an igp domain and how these

1937
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,400
different domains are organized in the

1938
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,640
in the network we have taken some common

1939
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,679
deployment

1940
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,000
cases it's not an exhaustive list

1941
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,480
so the first one is multiple as

1942
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,880
connected with ebgp where you have as1

1943
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,000
as2 as3

1944
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,120
as seen on the right side first diagram

1945
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,120
and ebgp is used to connect these

1946
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,520
domains and and whatever solution

1947
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,320
space has to address you know this kind

1948
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:48,719
of

1949
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,440
deployment the second one is a single as

1950
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,679
with multiple igp and same border node

1951
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:54,239
so

1952
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:58,239
you if you see abr one abr two um

1953
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:01,920
these are uh on border nodes uh and

1954
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:04,960
um you they have on the left side uh

1955
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,400
an igp and on the right side another igp

1956
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,280
so

1957
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,440
uh there's a common border node and and

1958
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,640
you can see that they're

1959
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:16,560
they are connected using ibgp sessions

1960
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,480
the third use case is a single as

1961
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:22,159
multiple igp but no common border

1962
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,640
so you can see that the abrs are

1963
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,480
separated there is no common bot they

1964
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:26,960
are all

1965
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,239
same as like as1 the domain one domain

1966
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:34,480
two and domain three are all using as1

1967
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,800
but there there is no common border node

1968
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,880
and they are still connected using uh

1969
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,000
ipgp sessions and and and these are kind

1970
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,239
of uh you know uh as an igp domain

1971
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:47,120
requirements that that have been uh

1972
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,679
uh covered in the draft next slide

1973
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,840
please

1974
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,600
so the so the requirement is also to be

1975
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,040
able to

1976
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,719
cover heterogeneous tunneling

1977
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,960
technologies in each of the domains

1978
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,880
for example srm pls with ipv4 and ipv6

1979
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,400
srm pls with dual stack srv6

1980
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,360
tunneling end to end and then srte as

1981
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,080
defined by

1982
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,440
the segment routing

1983
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,360
te policy should also cover flex algo

1984
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,400
for srm pls and srv6

1985
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,800
and additional requirement is also to be

1986
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,560
able to cover

1987
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,679
rsvp and ldp based tunnels as well as

1988
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,320
pure ip fabric where which is incapable

1989
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,080
of supporting mpls

1990
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,199
or srvs externally mechanisms

1991
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:47,839
next slide please

1992
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:58,880
so the other type of requirements that

1993
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,600
that

1994
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,760
the document talks about is the various

1995
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,159
sla requirements so various constraints

1996
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:04,960
that

1997
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,639
that needs to be satisfied when you

1998
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:09,120
build uh you know

1999
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,360
an end-to-end path so latency delay

2000
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,679
variation and link loss

2001
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,960
the end-to-end bandwidth constraints

2002
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,040
link inclusion exclusion constraints

2003
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,400
link node and domain

2004
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,040
inclusion exclusion constraints the next

2005
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,280
one is an ability to build diverse paths

2006
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:26,840
end to end

2007
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,440
including um you know diverse paths that

2008
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,280
satisfy

2009
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,639
srlgs so

2010
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,760
the next one is a use case specific to a

2011
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,840
data sovereignty where the constraint

2012
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,000
is might be applicable to only a subset

2013
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,400
of domains and it may not be applicable

2014
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,080
to other uh domains and you you need to

2015
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,840
have the ability to build

2016
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,840
an end-to-end path that is that

2017
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,320
satisfies these

2018
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,159
these constraints only in subset of

2019
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,520
domains

2020
01:21:57,520 --> 01:21:59,199
so in addition also service function

2021
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,199
chaining requirements where the service

2022
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:04,000
function chains may be located uh

2023
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,600
you know the multiple service functions

2024
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,360
may be located across

2025
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:11,839
different domains next slide please

2026
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,360
so we also want to focus on merger and

2027
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,800
migration requirements

2028
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,719
so the um the networks are always

2029
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:25,440
evolving

2030
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,000
and changing and you know we have to

2031
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,679
capture the requirements are

2032
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,920
arising out of these constant change in

2033
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,280
the network

2034
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,800
so as part of these mergers and

2035
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,639
migration requirements we have covered

2036
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,600
these aspects

2037
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,600
where you know a solution

2038
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,840
should inter-operate with existing

2039
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,239
seamless mpls solution which is based on

2040
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:49,840
bgplu so

2041
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,639
if certain nodes are not upgraded to the

2042
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,159
new solution

2043
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:56,159
uh you should still be able to create an

2044
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:57,280
end-to-end path and

2045
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,800
and and this new solution should

2046
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,280
interoperate with pgplu

2047
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,199
so other another aspect of

2048
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,639
these uh mergers and migration is is you

2049
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:10,719
know uh use cases that would require

2050
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:12,639
option a and option b

2051
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:15,760
um uh type of uh

2052
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,000
deployments and these um

2053
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,920
you know intent based paths end to end

2054
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:25,199
should cover those cases as well

2055
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,679
so the next one is the inter domain

2056
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,080
intent translation requirements this is

2057
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,880
this this you can imagine arises out of

2058
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,560
mergers where

2059
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,199
there may be another network that you

2060
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:37,679
know

2061
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,440
that is acquired and that uses a

2062
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,960
different uh

2063
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,000
intent mapping and and so the solution

2064
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,080
should be able to map

2065
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,600
these different uh

2066
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,520
different intents represented using

2067
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,840
different uh notations in the two

2068
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,800
domains so it should also have native

2069
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,880
support for best effort paths so you

2070
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,080
should not require

2071
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,440
uh to run two different uh families for

2072
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,239
uh you know be able to one for um best

2073
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,360
effort in another for

2074
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,199
intent based path so this this the

2075
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,719
solution should be able to natively

2076
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:13,120
support best effort paths

2077
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,639
and it should also interoperate with

2078
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,639
other tunneling mechanisms

2079
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,920
such as like one domain having srv6 in

2080
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,920
another having mpls and so on

2081
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:31,840
so next slide please

2082
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,360
ah so other aspect is scalability so

2083
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,600
the 5g networks are expected to grow to

2084
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:40,480
a very large

2085
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,320
number of nodes in the network so it

2086
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:45,760
should support up to 1 million nodes

2087
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,639
access nodes may be very low might have

2088
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,760
very low

2089
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,199
ribbon fib capacity so the solution

2090
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,400
should be able to

2091
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,719
address these cases and make sure only

2092
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:57,679
required routes

2093
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,520
are downloaded in in the access

2094
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,880
routers the solution should also have

2095
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,880
scalable response to network events that

2096
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,480
a network event happening in in one

2097
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,480
domain should not propagate

2098
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,880
uh into another domain so that that that

2099
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,760
would guarantee

2100
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,400
uh a very scala that would make sure a

2101
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,120
scalable network growth

2102
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,199
so minimize service routes on border

2103
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,600
nodes and then then

2104
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,719
so as part of scalability we've also

2105
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,719
captured the automatic requirement to

2106
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,639
automatically filter

2107
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:38,000
the routes on the access nodes so

2108
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,360
bgp has uh you know mechanisms such as

2109
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,760
you know based on policies you can

2110
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,800
filter the routes that a node receives

2111
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:49,840
but that is operationally very uh

2112
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,040
you know very heavy so um

2113
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,199
as a as a requirement we also propose

2114
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,920
that the solution should have an ability

2115
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,239
to automatically request only the routes

2116
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:02,159
that only uh the

2117
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:05,280
pe endpoint routes that it really needs

2118
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,440
to connect to

2119
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,440
and that has to happen based on i mean

2120
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,800
when you receive a service

2121
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,159
route based on what uh what end points

2122
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:15,600
the service route has been

2123
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,840
advertised from uh the access node

2124
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,480
should only get those

2125
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,679
infrastructure routes so non-mpls

2126
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,440
solutions uh should support

2127
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:26,560
summarization

2128
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,760
uh and uh the the solution should also

2129
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,000
have ability to reduce fib scale on

2130
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,120
border nodes uh next slide please

2131
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,679
shadow you are getting really out of

2132
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:38,560
time

2133
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,880
you really need to wrap up yeah sure

2134
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,480
i'll quickly cover

2135
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,840
uh yeah so we have

2136
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,760
also captured other requirements like

2137
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,360
availability operations

2138
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,360
and you know traffic steering

2139
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,719
requirements and

2140
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:55,040
um interaction with other approaches

2141
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,280
such as centralized approaches and also

2142
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,639
multicast requirements

2143
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,840
like uh in this if you are building a

2144
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,400
network for this kind of an architecture

2145
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,159
what are the multicast requirements you

2146
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,920
know that's covered in

2147
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,600
as well in the draft next slide please

2148
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,520
so um we are um requesting uh

2149
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:20,000
review and comments um and

2150
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,960
the bgp car problem statement also

2151
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:24,159
talked about

2152
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:27,280
similar requirements so

2153
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,679
we are talking to the authors of bgp

2154
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:30,960
card problem statement we have not

2155
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,120
concluded anything but we are talking

2156
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,800
so that's pretty much completes my

2157
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,800
talk thank you thank you

2158
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:47,840
uh carry on she wants the next one

2159
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,120
hi everyone can you hear me yes

2160
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:53,840
absolutely

2161
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,960
go ahead thank you so thank you for the

2162
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:57,679
opportunity

2163
01:27:57,679 --> 01:27:59,520
i'm going to present the pgp class 4

2164
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,719
transport planes

2165
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:04,320
today next place next at least

2166
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,040
so thank you for the previous two

2167
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,679
speakers who have

2168
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,040
explained the problem statement really

2169
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:13,600
well so i'll just show the agenda and

2170
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,280
then go that the solution we can skip

2171
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,560
the problem statement

2172
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,719
so i'm going to uh actually this uh

2173
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,840
idea was presented in the previous itfi

2174
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,080
idf

2175
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,360
108 and i'm going to recap a

2176
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:32,239
bit of the solution and advantages and

2177
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:33,280
then changes to the

2178
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,080
drafts and some sharing share some

2179
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,679
learning from the implementation

2180
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:40,840
and introduce related drafts excite

2181
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,840
please

2182
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:48,560
yeah this problem statement is what is

2183
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,320
explained by the previous two speakers

2184
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:57,520
so i think we can go to the next slide

2185
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,040
so the way uh bgpct uh

2186
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,960
solves the problems that have been

2187
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,159
described is

2188
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,400
like so the tunnels of the similar

2189
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,440
characteristics

2190
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,480
uh the operators can classify them

2191
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,679
into transport classes and the transport

2192
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:15,280
class is a construct that is identified

2193
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:16,960
by a 32-bit color

2194
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,760
and this supports different types of

2195
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:21,280
transport tunnels

2196
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,360
uh also the srt flex algo hypnos srv6 it

2197
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,639
can be anything

2198
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,199
and the vgpct is a new vgp transport

2199
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,400
layer address family

2200
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,800
it's like lu with where you can save

2201
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,000
with rdnrd which follows 4364 procedures

2202
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,280
so it's happy 76. and you can you can

2203
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,639
think of it as like

2204
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:43,199
even today we carry transport layer

2205
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:44,480
routes in l3bpn

2206
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,679
in some scenarios like uh uh 30s career

2207
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:49,600
so in a way there is a personality of

2208
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,280
this address family

2209
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,199
that is present deployed in the networks

2210
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:54,400
even today

2211
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,400
and we are just doing it clean that we

2212
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,320
are separating out as a new safety

2213
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,320
and to carry the transport routes so

2214
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,840
that transport routes can be given

2215
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,280
separate behavior than the service

2216
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,239
routes and uh so

2217
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:09,360
we reuse the existing mechanisms of

2218
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,600
the route distinguisher uh to

2219
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,719
distinguish different

2220
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,840
uh instances of a tunnel endpoint

2221
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,480
and we use a new type of route target

2222
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,080
new format of route target

2223
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,000
to identify the transport class that the

2224
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,600
road belongs to

2225
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,800
so which basically extends the tunnel

2226
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,199
across inter-domain boundaries by

2227
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,719
preserving the same transport class

2228
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:33,440
end-to-end basically it preserves

2229
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,000
it by resolving the vgp next hop over

2230
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,120
the tunnels belonging to the same

2231
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,000
transport class

2232
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,840
without allowing any fallback at the

2233
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,040
transport layer

2234
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,159
and it follows the 4364 option c-style

2235
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:45,840
procedures to create swap routes on the

2236
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,040
domain boundaries

2237
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,719
and these double domain boundaries could

2238
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,239
be either uh

2239
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:52,719
abrs which are doing bgp next top itself

2240
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:54,639
or it could be asbr which are doing with

2241
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,080
vpn stop itself

2242
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:58,560
so whichever node is doing a bgp next

2243
01:30:58,560 --> 01:30:59,679
stop itself

2244
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,639
for the bgpct routes it becomes a part

2245
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:03,600
of border node

2246
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,199
which stitches two different types of

2247
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:06,960
tunnels and

2248
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,920
that stitching element or emitting uh

2249
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,000
forwarding state could be either mpls or

2250
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,040
srv6

2251
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,760
so in this uh draft we basically can't

2252
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:16,719
focus on

2253
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,480
mpls because that is the de facto

2254
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,800
deployed uh technology today

2255
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,360
and there are other traffic explain uh

2256
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,880
other technologies

2257
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:27,040
and uh it works in conjunction with

2258
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,960
often a option b scenarios as well

2259
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,440
so that your transport class can be

2260
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,800
preserved across

2261
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,440
the boundaries and the way service

2262
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,080
routes

2263
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:38,639
they resolve over a resolution scheme

2264
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:40,560
and resolution scheme is nothing but an

2265
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,600
ordered

2266
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,480
set of transport classes which is like

2267
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:45,440
one color

2268
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,520
uh followed by another color or default

2269
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,560
transport class

2270
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,360
the default tunnels so they resolve over

2271
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:52,960
a resolution scheme by virtue of

2272
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,639
carrying a mapping community so the

2273
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,320
mapping community is nothing but a bjp

2274
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,120
community

2275
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,560
that maps to a resolution scheme and

2276
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:03,040
for service routes they use the color

2277
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,719
extended community

2278
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,440
which by default says resolve over color

2279
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:07,760
end

2280
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,480
with a optional fallback to best of all

2281
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,440
tunnels

2282
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,679
and the transport target that we have

2283
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,760
defined here that is on the bgpct route

2284
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,280
that results directly on the color and

2285
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,159
tunnels

2286
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,159
and that's for the reason of preserving

2287
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,719
the transport class end-to-end

2288
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:27,840
next slide please

2289
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,400
so this is just a recap to show what

2290
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,239
does a format look like

2291
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:35,679
so it just uh has no new things

2292
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:40,080
it's the plain boring rfc 4364.

2293
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:42,400
well proven format where we have the

2294
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,679
transporter of target

2295
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,920
uh and the cd traffic so we just have

2296
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,760
new code points for the safy and the

2297
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,600
target so that there is no collision

2298
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,120
with the service layer

2299
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:55,840
next slide please

2300
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,199
so this just shows a pictorial

2301
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:04,719
representation of whatever we discussed

2302
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:05,440
so far

2303
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:07,760
so in this case pe one one is the egress

2304
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,159
node and it has multiple color tunnels

2305
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:10,800
and we see

2306
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,719
two domains as1 as2 where es2 has

2307
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:17,840
two domains again with the avr in the

2308
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:18,480
middle

2309
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,520
so there are like three transport

2310
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:22,159
domains

2311
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,560
and they are different lsb uh tunneling

2312
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:25,840
protocols in each domain

2313
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,000
of various colors so we can just

2314
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,440
provision the transport classes and

2315
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,719
advertisers these

2316
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,840
routes in ct so that the english at the

2317
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,760
ingress either at the asbr 1 1

2318
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,440
or at the be21 the service routes can

2319
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,440
resolve over these transport class

2320
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:44,159
tunnels in the same manner

2321
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:50,719
next site please

2322
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,199
so i just wanted to take some time to

2323
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:53,920
recap

2324
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,880
uh using the or reusing the advantage of

2325
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,199
the using the 4364 encoding

2326
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:01,199
so the route distributor which is a

2327
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:01,620
well-known

2328
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:02,840
[Music]

2329
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,159
uh well deployed uh way of uh

2330
01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,280
distinguishing uh vpn route through an

2331
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,440
rr so it just avoids the use of multiple

2332
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,040
lowpass on usbe

2333
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:15,360
that satisfies the requirement it avoids

2334
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:18,000
path hiding when the transmitting r asbr

2335
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,760
and it allows unambiguously identifying

2336
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,920
the originating pe for debugging

2337
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,520
and it also allows any cast transport

2338
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:27,040
endpoints

2339
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,800
which can participate in multiple

2340
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,239
domains which may not necessarily

2341
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:35,280
agree on the color and

2342
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,440
it also allows cross selection after

2343
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,400
stripping the rd

2344
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:40,480
when necessary so this is helpful for

2345
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,679
faster convergence

2346
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:43,679
and also to keep the churn local to the

2347
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,119
domain where the

2348
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,520
churn is happening so basically rd is a

2349
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,679
good identifier of convenience it is

2350
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:50,560
well deployed

2351
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,520
and it can be used when needed to go

2352
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,159
through our

2353
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,400
sbrs without path hiding and we can

2354
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,080
strip it when not needed and too fast

2355
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,040
pass selection

2356
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,840
and it displays our end-to-end and the

2357
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,080
route targets that's uh

2358
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,000
even more helpful to propagate the

2359
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,920
transport class it allows forming venn

2360
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,360
diagrams of color domains

2361
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,920
as desired where for example the core

2362
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,280
network is having more fine grained

2363
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,719
colors and access networks

2364
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:16,800
or any new use cases that can come in

2365
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,000
future

2366
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,199
and yeah creating color is an attribute

2367
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:24,960
part of the nlri it just helps not

2368
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,080
having to rewrite the lra

2369
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:30,639
or having to guess where the color is

2370
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:31,360
coming from

2371
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:35,040
it's just always in the router and

2372
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,480
another important use of reusing 4364 is

2373
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,080
able to use the target constraint

2374
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,320
procedures so the service layer routes

2375
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,080
and the transport layout routes now can

2376
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,600
have a clean api

2377
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:47,840
where we can discover the transport

2378
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,719
classes that

2379
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,320
the npe needs and it can request in the

2380
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,440
bgpct layer

2381
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,520
so that becomes an on demand next top it

2382
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:57,600
will only require the

2383
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,560
transport routes that it needs it just

2384
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,880
reuses the time tested well deployed

2385
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,960
for the resistive wall machinery which

2386
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,480
is uh

2387
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,560
already deployed in half by half fashion

2388
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:10,719
across multiple domains so it just cuts

2389
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:12,239
down the experimentation and

2390
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,360
implementation

2391
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,600
times it improves reliability of the

2392
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:16,480
solution

2393
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,159
next slide please yeah you have to speed

2394
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:20,719
up

2395
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:25,119
carriers yeah

2396
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:26,800
so these are the updates so we just

2397
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,280
added some uh example topology with more

2398
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,159
illustration

2399
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:33,679
and pieces of instruction and we found

2400
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:34,000
it

2401
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,600
to be helpful to uh add how ct helps in

2402
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,199
the redundant abr scenario

2403
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,560
where there could be forwarding loop

2404
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,560
between the rfs and

2405
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,400
we also added scaling concentration

2406
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,840
section where

2407
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,440
we recommend 82 12 by default

2408
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,760
and the usage of our target filtering

2409
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:53,760
and mpls name spaces

2410
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,199
which is a new concept that can be

2411
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,679
applied to both lu and cke networks

2412
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,520
to deal with scaling because this this

2413
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,040
can help with seamless in the same place

2414
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:01,600
networks

2415
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,800
uh and scaling is the main problem that

2416
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,800
is uh it's a it's an important problem

2417
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,719
that is agreed upon

2418
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:10,400
and we added the applicable to the

2419
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,920
network slicing section where the

2420
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,600
transport class provides a topology

2421
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,840
slice part of the transport slice

2422
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,679
and we have support from the

2423
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:23,119
field thank you for the co-authors

2424
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:35,679
and we have working code exactly

2425
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:38,320
that's right please yeah so we can go to

2426
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,280
the next slide

2427
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,000
i'll explain with the topology uh what

2428
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,040
i'm talking about yeah

2429
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:45,520
you are really getting out of time there

2430
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:46,880
are so you really need to speed up

2431
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,239
because we have still

2432
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,199
a free presentation after you sure so

2433
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:51,920
this one

2434
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,320
is uh just talking about plane bgp

2435
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,000
machinery where when we have router

2436
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,679
reflectors doing next top itself

2437
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:59,360
there could be forwarding loops formed

2438
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,600
between abr 22 and api 23

2439
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,440
two routered router reflectors doing

2440
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:05,199
that stops off so there's an easy way to

2441
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:06,320
avoid it using

2442
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,639
uh ct where you don't provision the

2443
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:10,320
color tunnels between the abs

2444
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:11,920
so automatically the router resolution

2445
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,000
procedures will not uh

2446
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,560
have abr choose other apr as a next stop

2447
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:18,400
and only will choose the asbrs

2448
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,560
so that was just another anecdotal note

2449
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,480
that i wanted to share

2450
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:25,679
um i think i'm done i can take any

2451
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:26,719
questions

2452
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:31,840
here or on the mailing list

2453
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:35,360
oh yeah i'll take a moment to shout

2454
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:37,440
related traps so we have graphs in key

2455
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,000
sub

2456
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,119
uh srv6 and our target constraint

2457
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:42,639
uh that are being presented at the

2458
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:46,159
working rooks thank you

2459
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,239
uh swedish you have 30 seconds if you

2460
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:53,119
have a question

2461
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:56,480
even less than that yeah yeah i see

2462
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,600
you are carrying a color route target so

2463
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,639
do you suppose the import semantics as

2464
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:03,440
well as

2465
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,119
do you think a particular route can

2466
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:07,199
carry multiple intents

2467
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,679
hop by hop is that what you're looking

2468
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:11,520
at by putting it in the

2469
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,440
because you can have a multitypical rdt

2470
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,600
for our target it has the same semantics

2471
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,880
so a route

2472
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:21,920
can at a box it will have it will map to

2473
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,239
one

2474
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,960
uh transport class uh unambiguously but

2475
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,400
the route can carry multiple route

2476
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,520
targets so that

2477
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:29,280
different nodes in the network can

2478
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,960
import it into different

2479
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,360
so it can help with mergers and

2480
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,600
renumbering kind of use cases

2481
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,280
but you don't see it carrying multiple

2482
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,520
intents right

2483
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,520
it can carry multiple rock targets that

2484
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,880
basically uh

2485
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,840
map to the same intent okay yeah the

2486
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,360
requirement is still the same intent in

2487
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:47,760
that

2488
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:51,840
yeah okay

2489
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:56,320
okay uh

2490
01:39:56,639 --> 01:40:00,159
let's move on

2491
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:09,839
next speaker wait

2492
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:18,080
oh yeah go ahead

2493
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,760
okay uh hi everyone uh i'm weiwang from

2494
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:23,199
china telecom

2495
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:26,400
and on behalf of the others uh

2496
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:28,960
i will introduce the main content of our

2497
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,840
draft

2498
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,880
which named layer three accessible evpn

2499
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,560
services

2500
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,840
next slide please

2501
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:53,840
this presentation contains three parts

2502
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,800
uh first i will introduce the layer

2503
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,719
three accessible interfaces

2504
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,560
for evpn surveys and then i will

2505
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,159
introduce the solution

2506
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:07,760
we proposed to simplify the deployment

2507
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,960
of layer 3 accessible evpn

2508
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,480
and the last part is about the further

2509
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,440
actions

2510
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:20,080
of this draft and next slide please

2511
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:25,119
okay this page shows the service

2512
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:26,880
interfaces

2513
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,800
mentioned in rfc 7432

2514
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:34,080
and i believe everyone here is very

2515
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,520
familiar with them so let's move to the

2516
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:47,840
next slide

2517
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:52,159
the above service interfaces uh

2518
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:55,360
request the network between c and p

2519
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,360
is a layer 2 network but in most of

2520
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,800
provider network uh ce and p

2521
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:07,440
need to across a layer three network

2522
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:10,159
so the above service interfaces should

2523
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:11,199
be extended

2524
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:15,199
to adapt to the layers 3 network

2525
01:42:15,199 --> 01:42:29,199
next slide please

2526
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:33,199
uh we defined logical session

2527
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:37,040
in identifier to distinguish the

2528
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,000
packets from different tunnels which is

2529
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:40,719
related

2530
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:45,920
to wing eye or spi and we also

2531
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:49,760
defined three service interfaces

2532
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,840
rss based service interface lsi

2533
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:57,040
bundle service interface and sri aware

2534
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,320
bundle service interface

2535
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,639
they have similar features and

2536
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:03,679
requirements

2537
01:43:03,679 --> 01:43:06,960
to the service interfaces defined in

2538
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,080
rfc 7432

2539
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,040
and the first two service interfaces are

2540
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,320
easy to

2541
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:18,239
employment customer traffic isolation

2542
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:22,239
so we will mainly focus on the rsa

2543
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:25,840
aware bundle service interface

2544
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,679
and next slide please

2545
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:40,880
so let's assume the scenario as shown

2546
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,159
in the figure uh if we ask

2547
01:43:44,159 --> 01:43:48,560
the p1 2 and 3 are evpn peers

2548
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,280
and the customer traffic transmission

2549
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,800
between pes

2550
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,159
rely on vxlan the ces

2551
01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:59,760
are connected to the size of customer

2552
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:00,400
for its

2553
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,440
department a and b and if we

2554
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:07,280
assign a binary to each department

2555
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,280
and each winner has its own api

2556
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,480
on pes then hp

2557
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,920
and ce maintain an api for

2558
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:20,960
each department of the customer

2559
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,199
and the department traffic can be

2560
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:24,400
isolated by

2561
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,280
different winners so there is no need

2562
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:27,760
for

2563
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,880
extending control plan or

2564
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,000
forwarding plan protocols and

2565
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,880
next slide please

2566
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:46,080
but for deployment we expect

2567
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,840
a simpler way such as deploy and

2568
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,880
app rf to each customer not

2569
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,719
to each department that is to say

2570
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,159
uh always and i share one ip where

2571
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:03,520
on pes in this situation

2572
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,119
each city maintains an api for

2573
01:45:07,119 --> 01:45:10,880
each department but hp only

2574
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,960
maintains one ipri for a customer

2575
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,840
so the department traffic cannot be

2576
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,880
isolated by winning eyes

2577
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:23,760
next like this

2578
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:32,320
uh we proposed a solution

2579
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,360
to this scenario in this solution

2580
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,040
we use rsi information to identify

2581
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:43,040
different department use or traffic

2582
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:46,400
and in the control plane we will use

2583
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,520
ethernet type id or esi

2584
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,840
to transfer rsi information

2585
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,960
when receiving a packet

2586
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,480
the p will look up ipwrf with

2587
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,840
this to identify to determine the next

2588
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,840
forwarding behavior

2589
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:09,760
and the existing evpn

2590
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:13,600
type can carry this to identify

2591
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:17,520
so there is no need for extending the

2592
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,800
control plane

2593
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:27,840
protocols and next slide please

2594
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:50,320
wait are you silver

2595
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:56,320
hello yeah yeah do you see the slide

2596
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,360
oh okay i can't see and in the

2597
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,800
forwarding plane

2598
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,840
the protocols need to be extended

2599
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:07,199
to transmit the rsi information

2600
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,800
and with vxlan header we define a

2601
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:15,520
speed and if it is a value is one

2602
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,239
it indicates that the field after all

2603
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:18,639
bit

2604
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:22,400
is rsi information there is

2605
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:26,000
a one-to-one mapping between ariser

2606
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,520
and vmi or spi and

2607
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:32,880
ps should maintain the mapping table of

2608
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:33,920
them

2609
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,840
and next slide please

2610
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,639
our next step is to refine the

2611
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:50,159
extension scheme of control plane or

2612
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:53,040
forwarding plane protocols needed by the

2613
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,000
above

2614
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,600
solution and more solutions and

2615
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,679
comments are welcome thank you

2616
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,360
yeah we have a time for comments

2617
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:07,759
linda

2618
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:15,119
question for this lsi is that same as

2619
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:19,839
raw distinguisher

2620
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:23,920
erisa is identified

2621
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,280
to distinguish the package from

2622
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:31,199
different logical sessions

2623
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,760
right when you configure vif you can

2624
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:34,320
have a

2625
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,800
distinguisher to distinguish routes

2626
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,760
belonging to different

2627
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,800
different virtual network to me it seems

2628
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,080
very similar so

2629
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:48,159
just curious is that same or different

2630
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:01,840
way

2631
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:11,840
are you able to hear us

2632
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,599
hello yeah uh i can't uh

2633
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:19,119
i can't explain

2634
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:24,000
wait hello can you hear me

2635
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,239
yes yes we can we can you can you can

2636
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:27,119
answer to

2637
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:31,119
linda oh okay

2638
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,960
and sorry i maybe i missed the

2639
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,880
question okay in this case please take

2640
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,280
it out please take it to the list

2641
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,960
and we will move to the to the next

2642
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,119
question because we just have 30 seconds

2643
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:49,760
remaining jorge next one

2644
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:53,440
yeah yeah hi um i think you said

2645
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,800
you are using the esi in the uh routes

2646
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:57,280
type

2647
01:49:57,280 --> 01:50:00,480
5 uh to signal this lsi

2648
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:03,440
uh i don't think you can do that esi is

2649
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,480
for multi-homing

2650
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:09,040
and even in the rods type 5 so

2651
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:13,040
yeah you shouldn't do that i think

2652
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,520
uh hello hello

2653
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,599
uh adrian are you talking

2654
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:25,040
a a coater or contributor

2655
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:29,119
or are you taking over the line

2656
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:36,080
yeah yeah i want to answer the questions

2657
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,960
you know currently we consider using the

2658
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:39,840
internet attack

2659
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:43,920
or the or extension or development new

2660
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:46,800
new year's entire es type to transfer

2661
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,679
the

2662
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,920
uh ls information so if the internet tag

2663
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:53,679
can't be used we can

2664
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:56,719
rely on the esi type

2665
01:50:56,719 --> 01:50:58,960
okay

2666
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,679
okay we can take it offline yeah yeah

2667
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:03,280
please please take it for flying we have

2668
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:04,960
to uh we have to move on

2669
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:08,719
sorry tony you're the next one

2670
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:12,080
unfortunately raj we have

2671
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:14,480
we don't have time for for you for your

2672
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,879
last slot

2673
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
i'll make it super snappy it's a short

2674
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,080
one thank you so much

2675
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,599
is my audio okay it is good

2676
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:28,400
good thanks so we call it autoevpn uh

2677
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:29,520
not my idea

2678
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,560
um a product guy came to me and first i

2679
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:34,000
told him impossible and then got

2680
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:35,679
thinking

2681
01:51:35,679 --> 01:51:38,560
when is the architect and we have jordan

2682
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,080
who is editor of the draft next one

2683
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:42,320
please

2684
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,760
so i'll just talk quickly what are the

2685
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,159
drivers the vision of it architecture

2686
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:50,480
and then skip most of the details yes

2687
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:53,280
please next one

2688
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:59,119
next slide so evpn has been widely

2689
01:51:59,119 --> 01:52:00,320
successful

2690
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:03,520
um you know deployed and so on so on and

2691
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:04,800
you grow a lot of horns

2692
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:08,080
uh bells and buttons and it is not an

2693
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,480
easy technology to deploy and configure

2694
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:13,520
um so you really have two choices uh

2695
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:14,880
these days you either have a magic

2696
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:15,599
controller

2697
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:17,199
which you know it's a fine thing and

2698
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:18,719
probably large deployment is a very good

2699
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:19,840
idea

2700
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,679
but it has its own set of challenges you

2701
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:23,599
know how do you find the boxes

2702
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,679
and how do you know which box does what

2703
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,679
in the evpn network and so on

2704
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,960
or otherwise you go through the

2705
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,880
whole exercise of configuring an

2706
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,639
underlay and figure it out

2707
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,599
and then overlay on top and we know how

2708
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:39,520
many variables the stuff needs right and

2709
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,960
how many variants we have

2710
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,520
and the observation is actually that a

2711
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,040
very large part of customers is

2712
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,880
deploying in a very simple way pretty

2713
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,639
predictable way but they still have to

2714
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:49,599
learn the whole

2715
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,159
rigmarole of uh complexity to actually

2716
01:52:52,159 --> 01:52:53,920
understand what to put into the boxes to

2717
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:54,960
make them work

2718
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,880
so the question basically from you know

2719
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,159
our product sketch was

2720
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,159
can we make it as simple as l2 was

2721
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:02,239
because it's l2 after after all right so

2722
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,560
why can we just plug in boxes

2723
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:06,000
all right so we figure it out with the

2724
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,560
drift we can actually do that

2725
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,440
next slide please but of course you know

2726
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:12,719
we will not support

2727
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:14,719
all possible variations so here is a

2728
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:15,760
slide

2729
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:18,000
the links are barely legible so of

2730
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,679
course we talk about rift so we talk

2731
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:20,239
about

2732
01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:22,560
id fabrics which are built you know in

2733
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:23,840
very predictable way

2734
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,119
some kind of claw variation and

2735
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:28,639
we figured out that actually with drift

2736
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:30,400
we have enough information to

2737
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:33,840
completely evp and ztp uh without

2738
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,040
any user input um

2739
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,840
and the model that we support but the

2740
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:41,199
draft is open right

2741
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:43,760
is basically ibgp and we put rod

2742
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,520
reflector on the top of the fabric

2743
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:47,119
and we run integrating routing and

2744
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:48,880
bridging on the leaves which

2745
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,280
lots of people are moving towards that

2746
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,400
um

2747
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,880
a couple of things we found which are uh

2748
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,920
non-obvious

2749
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:01,119
is that uh if you want to stretch vlans

2750
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:04,000
well you can't derive the same values

2751
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,480
you know on all the fabrics so

2752
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,760
we we allow for an optional fabric id

2753
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,440
and that will allow you to stretch the

2754
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:14,000
lens and we can ultimately get the right

2755
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,920
stretch and not stretch vlans

2756
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,040
um by doing that

2757
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,719
um what else was interesting

2758
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:25,040
well you end up with something where you

2759
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,800
just have to tell the fabric what what

2760
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,480
is the top of the fabric otherwise it's

2761
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,119
absolutely no input and evpn comes up

2762
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:37,839
um next slide please

2763
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,800
and it doesn't have some first details

2764
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,400
so basically the draft will flash out

2765
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,239
how you derive all the variables that

2766
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:46,159
are necessary you know like a cluster id

2767
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:48,000
whatever the loopbacks and

2768
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,199
router ids and as you're on and so on

2769
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,360
um that will be all filled in because

2770
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,960
the draft right now is pretty naked we

2771
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:55,280
just

2772
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,880
didn't have time you know to put all the

2773
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,560
details and

2774
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,119
next slide

2775
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:05,360
and it will also contain type five um

2776
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:07,280
right so there is a little bit that

2777
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,199
we'll have to put additionally into rift

2778
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:09,520
uh

2779
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,880
if we want to support especially

2780
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,280
multiplying it's an interesting problem

2781
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,400
and um we can also put in rift basically

2782
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,080
minimal telemetry for the whole

2783
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,119
thing right because people uh it's it's

2784
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:22,639
kind of hard to figure out where the

2785
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,239
whole thing works people want to know

2786
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:25,760
you know how many l2

2787
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:28,080
type 2 and type 5 rods will happen with

2788
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,280
all the bgp

2789
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,199
sessions came up and so on and so on and

2790
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:32,880
we can basically stick it into the key

2791
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,239
value store of

2792
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:37,040
rift flood it up and then the top of the

2793
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,639
fabric just like today you see the

2794
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:40,159
underlay you can also look whether the

2795
01:55:40,159 --> 01:55:41,840
whole authoring vpn

2796
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:44,880
came up and is saying um

2797
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:48,159
nothing too ambitious but you know makes

2798
01:55:48,159 --> 01:55:50,239
this stuff as simple as sticking l2

2799
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:51,520
switches together again

2800
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:54,159
next one please

2801
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,960
right so next revision will have the

2802
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,480
algorithms and we also

2803
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:01,920
uh do the type 5 irb variables because

2804
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,880
we kind of

2805
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:05,679
commented them out simply no time and we

2806
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:07,360
also talked about how we put the stuff

2807
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:08,880
into the key value store

2808
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,080
co-authorship is welcome um

2809
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:13,679
there is an open source python something

2810
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:15,679
like that can be easily hacked in

2811
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:17,760
and another interesting observation is

2812
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,000
that if you participate as leaf only you

2813
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:21,199
only need to leave

2814
01:56:21,199 --> 01:56:23,280
implementation for rift which is far far

2815
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,440
simpler than the whole thing

2816
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:27,920
and that's the end of my stick any

2817
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:31,040
questions observations

2818
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,080
uh quick question tony is there any

2819
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,760
relationship with the

2820
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:41,280
bgp auto conf work which is done in idea

2821
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:43,440
well they're mostly concerned about how

2822
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:44,719
to uh

2823
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:47,440
uh bring obsession i mean i'm not sure

2824
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,440
which draft we're talking about

2825
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,679
um i mean i'm i'm aware that we're

2826
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:53,840
talking now about the v6 of the

2827
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:56,080
v4 v6 draft and of course all the you

2828
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,400
know auto session for bgp i'm very well

2829
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:01,199
aware of what's going on there i'm not

2830
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:03,440
aware of the stuff you're talking about

2831
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:06,080
yeah jeff presented something yesterday

2832
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,040
uh

2833
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:09,280
regarding the work of the design team in

2834
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:13,679
idea working on bgp autocomfort

2835
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:17,760
no if it stretches beyond the uh

2836
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,920
just appearing without configuration

2837
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,280
then i'm not aware of that

2838
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,320
no no i i think it's mostly

2839
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,960
this is mostly discovering the functions

2840
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:27,599
of

2841
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:29,920
of the node establishing vbgp sessions

2842
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,639
and so on yeah

2843
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:32,639
of course this is not exactly the full

2844
01:57:32,639 --> 01:57:34,159
scope uh

2845
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:36,400
you you are doing but i'm wondering if

2846
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,000
at least some part of the work

2847
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,040
could be reused that's jeff charming

2848
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,599
we talk a lot but he never told me about

2849
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:47,920
it or maybe i didn't listen

2850
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:52,239
just on the money

2851
01:57:52,239 --> 01:57:56,159
josh yeah no it isn't uh

2852
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:58,800
this solution requires recent underlay

2853
01:57:58,800 --> 01:57:59,199
while

2854
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:01,760
auto discovery talks about bgp being the

2855
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:02,880
product also

2856
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:07,840
they are really independent okay

2857
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,760
bgp auto configuration i mean i think

2858
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:23,280
it's mainly to establish the bgp

2859
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:24,719
configuration but could you not extend

2860
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:25,199
it to

2861
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:26,800
include some of the parameters that are

2862
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:30,960
needed for evpn i think you could not

2863
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:33,760
there's a question about the discovery

2864
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,679
is to establish bgp sessions

2865
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,080
no no sure but yeah

2866
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:45,040
uh observation is that to really be able

2867
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,480
to derive that stuff you have to

2868
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:47,199
understand

2869
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:49,280
what your role is in the fabric and for

2870
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:50,880
that you have russian

2871
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:53,599
apology right so you can't run it on an

2872
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:54,880
arbitrary thing

2873
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,800
and yeah sure you can probably extend

2874
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,800
other protocols i mean you can make isis

2875
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,239
look like rift at the end you know

2876
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:03,280
i'm i know i'm a little bit flippant oh

2877
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:03,920
but you're

2878
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,000
you're basically extend and you're

2879
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,679
exchanging information right so it's

2880
01:59:07,679 --> 01:59:09,199
basically you how do you distribute

2881
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:10,320
information

2882
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:13,920
now you get it to the various points

2883
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,880
that needed it

2884
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:19,040
okay ac

2885
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,199
yeah i think ac lindem cisco i'm on the

2886
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:28,560
design team with uh the two jeffs and

2887
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:31,599
wim uh i think the autocom it's

2888
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:33,920
will be quite a stretch to take we have

2889
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:36,239
to be we have the bgp role to just have

2890
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:38,480
a role of router plays to do with

2891
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:42,080
everything for uh uh and that's really

2892
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,560
supposed to be plug and play uh for this

2893
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,840
for this work

2894
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:49,119
but also it

2895
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,599
generally doesn't go more than one hop

2896
01:59:51,599 --> 01:59:53,040
the solutions we're looking at for the

2897
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,320
data center so that's not

2898
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:59,840
this isn't within the scope right now

2899
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:09,360
okay any other comment
