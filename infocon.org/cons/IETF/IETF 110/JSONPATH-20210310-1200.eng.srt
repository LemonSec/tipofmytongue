1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,759
a few names short

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,120
mostly my other chair

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,040
i will give it a couple more minutes

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
if people want to do a mic check or

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:31,839
test test things out just just jump in

6
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,440
i really want to start but i think

7
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,480
we're short you very very key

8
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,940
people

9
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,840
[Music]

10
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,160
uh let's see if i can get in touch with

11
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,239
them

12
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,879
i know that marco can't make it because

13
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
his daughter's unwell

14
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
oh okay okay

15
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,920
i was more wondering where my co-chair

16
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,159
was

17
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,840
um admittedly it's quite early in the

18
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,360
morning for him

19
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
um i've sort of sent him a couple of

20
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360
messages

21
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
i haven't heard anything back yet

22
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,959
we may have to just start uh without him

23
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
and i hope that he uh joins us

24
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,360
uh before we make any sort of real

25
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,040
progression

26
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,480
um just so that we can stick to time

27
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,400
i think what i'll do is i'll give it two

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
more minutes and we'll start at five

29
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
minutes past

30
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,760
the hour it's probably the safest bet to

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
do and in the meantime i'll see if i can

32
00:03:47,360 --> 00:04:01,840
get in touch with him

33
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,600
okay uh i've tried to call tim and i

34
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,240
couldn't get

35
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,360
through so uh let's just

36
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,280
let's just get started because this

37
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,199
shouldn't be an overly complicated

38
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,840
affair

39
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,639
um so uh good day people this is the

40
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,720
jason path working group for ietf 110.

41
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
uh just before we get started the usual

42
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
you've probably seen this before but but

43
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
i have to do the

44
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
the reminder this is the note well uh it

45
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
applies to this meeting as it does

46
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,759
to all other ietf meetings uh please

47
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
note well if you have any questions

48
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
myself and francesca our new ad

49
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,120
can answer any questions and forward you

50
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,600
on to people as appropriate

51
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,639
uh can i uh

52
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,360
before we get uh into i guess the meat

53
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
of the discussion

54
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,080
do we have somebody that can be a note

55
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,840
taker please

56
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,880
i understand this instigates a certain

57
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,719
amount of bystander syndrome

58
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,639
but if if somebody could take notes

59
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,960
please that would be very appreciative

60
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
i can take it thank you jeffrey

61
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,350
um

62
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,039
[Music]

63
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,800
if you send it out afterwards i'm sure

64
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
we can we can help out

65
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,800
uh with anything that you miss um

66
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,240
thank you uh as for a javascribe

67
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,639
uh i'll um given that we're we're quite

68
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,479
a small group i'm more than happy to do

69
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,680
that

70
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
um is there any agenda bashing is there

71
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,720
anything that anybody

72
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,080
has a particular subject they'd like to

73
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,599
bring up before we get started

74
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,080
nope okay the agenda's

75
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,639
fairly minimal today usually i would

76
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
expect him to be driving this uh he's

77
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,479
unfortunately not here

78
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,479
but i guess maybe is a good starting

79
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,720
point um

80
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
if if our editors and those who've been

81
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
working hard on the draft

82
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,639
could uh perhaps provide some sort of

83
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,479
informal update about where things are

84
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
when you you recently have had submitted

85
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,440
the renaming of the draft

86
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,840
is there any other updates

87
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,160
you can just unmute yourself glenn

88
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,720
that's fine okay

89
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,520
not used to the protocol um i can just

90
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
summarize where we're at

91
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
i mean a while back we we formed the

92
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,199
working group

93
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,799
and got a uh emerged draft together

94
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,440
of the draft that i'd been editing and

95
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,039
the one that stefan gerstner

96
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,679
and carson have been working on and so

97
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,120
we got that merged draft

98
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,559
and uh there's been a little bit of

99
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,040
editorial work on it and that's now

100
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
the current base zero zero version in

101
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
the documents um

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,080
area on data tracker um but more

103
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,839
recently there's been a flurry of

104
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,519
activity on the mailing list and in

105
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,480
issues

106
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
uh discussing various aspects um

107
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,760
gradually coming to conclusions in

108
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
various places but a lot of discussion

109
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,320
going off in various tangents so

110
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,800
i'm not sure whether we're converging or

111
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
diverging at the moment but there's

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
certainly a lot of discussion going on

113
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,800
but no sign of any pull requests so um

114
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
there's no writing going on as far as i

115
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
can tell and

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
just personally my intention is to work

117
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
on the reference implementation

118
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,959
or a reference implementation and leave

119
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,240
the writing to um

120
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,040
to stefan and marco that was the the

121
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
current plan

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,839
i think that's everything from my

123
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,240
perspective

124
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
okay okay

125
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
it probably doesn't help us that

126
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,399
neither stefan nor marco are here

127
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
um that makes this that makes this uh

128
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
meeting a little bit difficult to

129
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,200
sort of make any sort of progress i

130
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,920
understand this

131
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,760
there's currently a handful of issues

132
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,399
that are um that remain

133
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
uh open uh some of which are more

134
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,880
contentious

135
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,959
than others uh is there any particular

136
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:15,519
issues

137
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,880
that are perhaps require a bit more

138
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
discussion

139
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,959
uh in this forum uh

140
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,359
that worth going through uh carsten

141
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,279
yeah i'm not an author i'm

142
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,120
not coordinating this process in any

143
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,000
way but i do intend to provide further

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
pull requests

145
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,839
it's just that this itf had a lot of

146
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,839
other challenges

147
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,839
for me so don't count on the current

148
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,640
silence

149
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
and continuing because i think there is

150
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,839
still

151
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,160
a lot to be done editorially with with

152
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
the document

153
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,839
but also i think we we really need to

154
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,200
uh get uh a few issues

155
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
out of the way that that really need to

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,959
be decided

157
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,640
uh before we can make such a substantial

158
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,839
uh further progress and for me right now

159
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
the most important issue is

160
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
uh what is exactly going to be the

161
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,920
processing

162
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,279
uh model that we assume um

163
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,680
and we have had some discussions on on

164
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,880
the list

165
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
uh but i think we we haven't really

166
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,959
managed to structure these

167
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
uh discussions yet in a way that that

168
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,959
leads to

169
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,720
uh progress and i think that that's

170
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
really the next

171
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,800
big item but i'm i'm also aware that

172
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
there are lots of little issues that

173
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:44,880
that

174
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
are that do merit working on on them

175
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
uh on their own okay

176
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,839
that that's that's very that's a very

177
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,240
good update thank you for that carsten

178
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,760
um in terms of the

179
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,040
uh processing model as you described it

180
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,399
um is that to me

181
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,519
sort of sounds like an effort for

182
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
perhaps is that something that we could

183
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,519
discuss in in this time slot now and

184
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,360
make some sort of meaningful discussion

185
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800
about or is that something you think we

186
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,200
should

187
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,200
uh take to the mailing list

188
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,079
well i think it's always better if it's

189
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,519
carefully prepared

190
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
if a discussion is carefully prepared

191
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
but given that we don't have that

192
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,680
uh may we could do a little bit of

193
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,120
impromptu

194
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,519
uh discussion and and see where we are

195
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,440
with respect to that sure

196
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
um i'm gonna uh take your lead on that

197
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
because i think that you're far more

198
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,760
informed on that than i am

199
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,079
thank you for throwing back the ball um

200
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,279
yeah um so do you want to do this now

201
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,000
are there

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
other things you want to do first i

203
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,120
don't

204
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,880
to be honest with you i now that we've

205
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
started talking about it

206
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,120
given that we don't exactly have a a

207
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,639
rich agenda of of

208
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,200
of discussion points to go through it's

209
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
probably the best

210
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,760
use of our time

211
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,959
okay so there are 23 issues on

212
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,000
on the github repository that are marked

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
as open

214
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,519
and i think we haven't really

215
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,880
managed to to label them

216
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
uh appropriately and we haven't really

217
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,800
managed to

218
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,920
to boil them down to

219
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,680
issues that are narrow enough that you

220
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
actually can

221
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,160
resolve those but there are issues like

222
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,120
sequence of results duplicates and

223
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,839
selector

224
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
output and and maybe the whole

225
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,360
discussion about the

226
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
the term union uh that that really

227
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,480
point to to some some

228
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,519
uncertainty about what the processing uh

229
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,040
model is now given that that jsonpath

230
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,360
has

231
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,279
thank you given that that jsonpath

232
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,720
has learned from from

233
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,240
xpath in its youth

234
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,800
i think it's interesting to look at the

235
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,279
the

236
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,120
xpath processing model which is

237
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,560
really uh about node sets

238
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,240
as as the the most important

239
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,079
um data structure um

240
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,160
that that is being used at least an

241
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,279
abstract

242
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
fashion and then you have steps

243
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,880
that go through these note sets so the

244
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
whole thing has a really long story

245
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,399
um much of this was developed in in the

246
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,519
late 80s

247
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
early 90s in the context of the

248
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,519
diesel project document style semantics

249
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,279
and specification language

250
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
uh in in iso iesc but basically the idea

251
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,519
is

252
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,839
that you have ways to to

253
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,800
step from the nodes that that you are

254
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,720
currently sitting on

255
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
and that you have ways to to select

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
subsets and and compute values

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,480
um and at the time we had an expression

258
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
language that was based on this

259
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
that is what that was doing all these

260
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,759
things that that got

261
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,720
turned into a special thing for xpath

262
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,519
and and xslt but i think basically

263
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,120
the idea is the same but the the

264
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
important part to make this whole thing

265
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,240
work

266
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
is that you need to know where you are

267
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,360
and and what actually the

268
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,279
the how the sequence of steps

269
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,720
um actually are connected together so

270
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,800
what are the intermediate

271
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,839
results and for xpath that's a pretty

272
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,759
obvious structure that's the the note

273
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,519
set

274
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,560
so you essentially identify a subset

275
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,040
of the set of positions that are defined

276
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,000
in the

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,160
uh document um so the node set has a few

278
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
interesting properties and

279
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,639
and one of them is that it actually

280
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,480
does not record duplicates so you you

281
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,560
only can mark a note once in a note set

282
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,680
um so that automatically gives you

283
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,000
one property which is interesting and

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
also the the set is not by itself

285
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,360
ordered

286
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,839
uh so that there is no aura information

287
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,639
left by

288
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
by the uh various operations i hope

289
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,800
somebody is taking good notes uh

290
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,440
jeffrey is he's also asked a question um

291
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,160
asking if

292
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,440
if we've got a specific issue in the

293
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
issues i presume jeffrey you're

294
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,720
referring to

295
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
uh the processing model is that correct

296
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,599
two for context if we could mention

297
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,799
issue numbers then i'll

298
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,000
i'll dump them in the notes okay

299
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,039
yeah so um just judging from the title

300
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,720
i think 27 is one of them 23 is one of

301
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,039
them

302
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,039
21 um is uh

303
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,280
one of them i think even 15 is 14 and 15

304
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,400
uh are one so these are just different

305
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,039
ways of of approaching the elephant and

306
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,440
and

307
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,480
finding trunks and legs and so on off of

308
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,679
the overall question what's the

309
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,679
processing model

310
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,000
okay with with those issues you've

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
identified

312
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,120
we can just quickly create a label and

313
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,240
attach it to

314
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,880
the ones that that you think uh fall

315
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,080
under that and then

316
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,600
so that we can collect them together if

317
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,679
that's useful

318
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,120
sounds good okay so of course

319
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,640
it would be nice if the people who

320
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
raised these issues would would

321
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
actually agree that they pertain to this

322
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
general problem of processing model

323
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,000
okay uh

324
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
i think that that's the the the first

325
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
one that that really brought up the

326
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,400
uh problem to to the service yep

327
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,760
bear with me a second it helps if i'm

328
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,120
signed in uh

329
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,879
okay so

330
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,320
let's create a new label shall we

331
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,439
just call it processing

332
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,000
um backflip drivers are welcome here

333
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,280
uh so saying 14.

334
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,760
hang on one second where is it

335
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,960
good so we're on the same page so

336
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,000
uh was 57 did you no no it wasn't 57

337
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
sorry um carson can you remind me which

338
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,039
issues you

339
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,200
you highlighted specifically it was 14

340
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,080
15.

341
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,960
no i cannot say that but i can try to

342
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,320
find them again

343
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,679
um so i think 15 at least touches

344
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,960
on this 21 23

345
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,600
and 27 touch on these

346
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,840
okay

347
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,840
thank you jeffrey okay

348
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,960
and and the label doesn't set anything

349
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,640
in concrete it just allows us

350
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
it'll just allow us to be able to

351
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,919
identify these later on and have this

352
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,840
discussion

353
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,960
so yeah

354
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
i must admit that i added some labels in

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
hoping that i would spawn a process

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,400
where other people add labels

357
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
but that hasn't happened uh yet maybe

358
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,159
because people are

359
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,799
unsure about what what they are allowed

360
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
to do here and and what not and

361
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,159
uh i'm kind of on the wikipedia be bold

362
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,039
side

363
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,960
you will be called back if you do

364
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,159
something that's not appropriate

365
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,159
given the amount of participation that

366
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,000
we have is fairly minimal

367
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,799
the uh and thank you for the link in the

368
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,799
chat christina um

369
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,880
given the amount of we've got fairly a

370
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
small community here in this working

371
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,440
group

372
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,360
uh i would say just go ahead and do

373
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,480
stuff

374
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,320
um obviously in a considerate manner

375
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,679
so if people need access uh i need to

376
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,320
twiddle

377
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,799
things to help you get this work done i

378
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,080
will do it

379
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,280
um that's that's that's my role

380
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,960
so uh okay so i think that's

381
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,110
most of the issues 27 23

382
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,320
[Music]

383
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,200
23 duplicates and selector outputs

384
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,720
we think this one's also part of the

385
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,240
list

386
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,520
well definitely because uh how this

387
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:17,919
thing

388
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,480
that replaces the note set which i have

389
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,400
called collection just as a placeholder

390
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,280
word

391
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
but uh how how that is structured um

392
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,280
actually tells you how what the fate

393
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,679
will be of duplicates

394
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,880
yup no this looks like it uh we've just

395
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,520
got some ongoing discussion in there

396
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,640
so 21 23 27

397
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,919
i think i've covered all of them uh

398
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,060
except 14.

399
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,169
[Music]

400
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,959
okay 14 would be the other one to

401
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,080
include

402
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,880
okay so it sounds like one of the

403
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
actions we've now got

404
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,559
is to uh i guess

405
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,039
try to uh triage these a little bit

406
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,840
further

407
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,600
okay i'm trying to think about

408
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,280
how we should keep going with this

409
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,200
well let me just throw out the strawman

410
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
that i'm sure

411
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,120
nobody else but me likes and and then we

412
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,919
can try to find out why people don't

413
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,039
uh like that so my straw man is why

414
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,840
don't we just

415
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,520
import the note set idea from from xbox

416
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,919
wholesale and structure everything

417
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,799
around node sets

418
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,120
okay is there anybody else from the

419
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,639
working group who would like to chime in

420
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,840
i see julia oh we have consensus

421
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,919
okay i think we've got consensus on that

422
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,840
that was very good

423
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
okay yeah i'll buy it

424
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,440
um so it depends on the

425
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,120
type of reference that the node set

426
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,679
makes into the um

427
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,360
into the json document that's input um

428
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,799
how did you see that going would you

429
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,559
would that be a um

430
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,480
uh would it point to a node would it be

431
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,320
a reference to a node in some sense

432
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,600
in in the original document or a

433
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,720
copy or what or a value no it's a

434
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
reference

435
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,320
reference okay um

436
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,960
yeah i mean certainly in the um

437
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,760
in my input draft uh the processing

438
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
model i had in mind was that we

439
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,279
built up a uh an ordered list of

440
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,279
uh elements as we went through the

441
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,480
jsonpath

442
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,200
uh selector you know the components of

443
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,640
the selector

444
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,960
and um and didn't remove duplicates and

445
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,799
i just had in mind

446
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,480
uh efficiency really um and

447
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,600
sensitivity to the current

448
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,039
implementations i don't think there are

449
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:15,679
many

450
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:17,360
if any implementations that remove

451
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,600
duplicates

452
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,880
so that that was my goal but um

453
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,720
certainly having a uh maybe not a node

454
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
set but a node list

455
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,720
you know an ordered collection of nodes

456
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,120
would satisfy that

457
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,200
it wouldn't have to be values because

458
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,400
they're uh

459
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,200
immutable so reference into the original

460
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
structure would be helpful

461
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
and also it would tie down the fact that

462
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,120
the intermediate values passing through

463
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,760
were all

464
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,799
sub-nodes sub-trees of the original

465
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,279
document

466
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,600
yeah so the definition of the term node

467
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,199
would be a subtree

468
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,799
document and not the value of that but

469
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,200
the actual subject

470
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,400
yeah so my preference would be to allow

471
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,120
duplicates in that list

472
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,159
yeah so if you turn from a set

473
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,400
to a list you get two things you get the

474
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
ability to get duplicates and you get

475
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,600
order

476
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,799
yeah and uh you know admittedly there's

477
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,720
a trade-off there because

478
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,799
from the user's perspective they may

479
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,240
prefer not to have duplicates

480
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,039
but it depends how quickly they want the

481
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:43,840
result to be returned

482
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,840
okay that doesn't sound particularly

483
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
contentious

484
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,110
okay is there um

485
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,400
[Music]

486
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,520
any other i'm trying to think if there's

487
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,720
any sort of value of us going through uh

488
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,559
the rest of the issues that are here

489
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,919
um make most of the time that we've got

490
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,799
to discuss

491
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,840
all of this um

492
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,880
the next step would be to actually go

493
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
through these issues

494
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
with the assumption we are using a node

495
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
list

496
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,039
and see whether the examples that have

497
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,760
been brought up in these issues

498
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,039
actually bring up problems with that or

499
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,279
advantages of of doing that

500
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,279
that may be a bit tedious to do in the

501
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,320
meeting so i'm wondering how to do this

502
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,440
so if i was doing this in a classroom

503
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
um i would just divide the students into

504
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,679
small groups each one of them gets an

505
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,559
issue and

506
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,799
looks at it for five minutes and then

507
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,080
reports

508
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,960
on what they found

509
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,320
yep uh that would be uh the only

510
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
challenge that we have

511
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,720
is that uh our editors aren't about

512
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,240
um so

513
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
which i met i kind of ran on the

514
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,919
assumption that they would be in the

515
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,600
best position

516
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,039
to do this but this is certainly

517
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,440
something that that uh

518
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,039
i can i can do and

519
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
i guess if we can get some help from

520
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,120
other members of the working group who

521
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,399
have prepared to look at a couple of

522
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,799
issues

523
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
i wouldn't want to lump all of the work

524
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,039
with you carsten

525
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,880
yeah i'm afraid mideco doesn't have

526
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
breakout rooms which

527
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,840
i would use for that um so

528
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,240
it's hard to to duplicate we have done

529
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
this in this new thing to think research

530
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,720
group

531
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,880
occasionally that we just we all went

532
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,279
into one of the four corners of the room

533
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,000
and and try to get some some work to get

534
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,880
done and then

535
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
came back together and reported on on

536
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,799
what the four corners found

537
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,399
but you cannot do this in mid echo yeah

538
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,039
i mean we've got this there's 23 issues

539
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,200
here and i don't think all of them

540
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,559
uh apply to what what we've agreed about

541
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,279
with regards to the node set

542
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,640
um there's uh really just the

543
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,399
the processing model tickets that we've

544
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,720
listed here although i think there may

545
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
be others that

546
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,640
i'm just sort of looking at the names

547
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,360
judging books by their covers

548
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,159
um seeing if there's any others that

549
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,840
might fit into that

550
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,640
um uh yes jeffrey

551
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,520
uh uh if if if folks would like to help

552
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,559
out with regards

553
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,720
to sort of triaging these uh

554
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,120
priority stickers as carson described

555
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,159
that would be

556
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,840
that's that's sort of the ask here

557
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,918
okay

558
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
if there's if there's uh anybody who'd

559
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,480
like to help out with that please speak

560
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,159
up now

561
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,960
um are we talking about are we talking

562
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
about doing in real time

563
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,440
uh taking a break

564
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,240
i think that would be a bit too uh

565
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,679
finicky and

566
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,559
uh about as amusing as paint drying i

567
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,080
think this is one of those

568
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,520
things where uh we go away offline

569
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,919
uh and have a look at this uh because it

570
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,480
may stir ongoing discussion

571
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
um that may need to come back to the

572
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,480
list

573
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,600
or so on and so forth um

574
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,200
but it sounds like that we've got uh

575
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,640
we've got a bit of an action there and

576
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
this is something that i'll i'll talk to

577
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,239
tim go ahead jeffrey

578
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
if we don't have other things to talk

579
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,000
about in particular then it might

580
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,240
actually be a good use of time to like

581
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,279
assign assign an issue to to each person

582
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,559
who volunteers

583
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,799
uh okay stop talking for five minutes

584
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,320
and then come back and report back on

585
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,000
the issues

586
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,840
okay uh is that all does that mean

587
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,799

14

592
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,279
to find an algorithm

593
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,440
oh no not me idiots

594
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,840

596
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,559
um jeffrey do you have a uh if you don't

597
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,559
have a choice i will give you 15.

598
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,799
i think you're on here i can't assign

599
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,918
this to you i don't think jeff

600
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,399
oh yeah true but i will leave

601
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,840
i will leave 15 with you um if you don't

602
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,240
mind

603
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,240
can i just interrupt i mean i think

604
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,000
signing and one of these issues to

605
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,679
someone at this point is probably not

606
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,320
the best

607
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,720
ploy because um we're just talking about

608
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,399
doing some analysis coming back

609
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,360
and discussing it uh whereas we don't uh

610
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,600
i

611
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
personally don't want to be quite

612
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
lumbered with one of these issues

613
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,760
after the meeting

614
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,760
okay yeah let's all let's clear those

615
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,600
assignments after the meeting

616
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,159
we can do this for now i don't think we

617
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,440
have any assignments

618
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,159
that need to be preserved yeah okay i'm

619
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,200
happy to do 20

620
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,240
i can do 27.

621
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
okay

622
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,649
[Music]

623
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,799
since i cannot make slides i i'm just

624
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:29,840
going to type into the notes

625
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
oh

626
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,920
you

627
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
oh

628
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,800
no no no no no no no no no no no no no

629
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,839
no no

630
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,839
foreign

631
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
foreign

632
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
hmm

633
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,720
for uh time it might be an idea that we

634
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
sort of

635
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,200
uh make moves in about say

636
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
five ten more minutes unless people feel

637
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:35,839
they need a bit more time

638
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:49,839
uh i finished it's glenn okay

639
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:17,839
or two

640
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:45,839
this is

641
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,400
okay uh shall we

642
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,839
uh continue

643
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,640
please ah well i

644
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,200
i guess uh does anybody want to talk

645
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,119
first

646
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,839
i guess there's more of a question

647
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,280
jeffrey

648
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,280
sure um could someone else take notes

649
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,240
for any discussion that that arises for

650
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:06,880
this

651
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,839
section

652
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,440
sure uh if nobody else will step up to

653
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,359
it i'll put myself on mute and

654
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,960
take what i can sure um so i looked at

655
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,560
15 um which is uh

656
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,400
selector definitions basically an

657
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,640
attempt to start a processing model

658
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,520
um and karsten has chimed in there with

659
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,359
the collections idea

660
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,079
um and uh the the impact of of defining

661
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,599
this as a list

662
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,599
seems to be that that nobody is doing

663
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,640
that by default

664
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
um all of the discussion is talking

665
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,960
about which set of objects

666
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,599
uh particular things are returning and

667
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,160
not

668
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,200
uh what order they are um and

669
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,920
in javascript objects kind only kind of

670
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,040
have an order

671
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,319
um i looked up the json rfc and it says

672
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,359
sometimes they

673
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,880
they make the ordering of object members

674
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,119
visible so we're going to have

675
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,240
if if we keep an order here we're going

676
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,440
to have to say that it's

677
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,040
we're going to have to say what order

678
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,960
things things show up in

679
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,079
um which could be could be ambiguous for

680
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,040
objects

681
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,440
otherwise everything seemed consistent

682
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,280
and actually to be assuming

683
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,200
um definitely like that that duplicates

684
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,720
well it doesn't mention whether

685
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,319
duplicates happen but it

686
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:33,839
doesn't describe deduplicating either

687
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,720
yeah so the the whatever 8259 says

688
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,280
um the practical matter is that that

689
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,720
jsonpath evaluator will

690
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,000
sometimes have to work on json data and

691
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,240
not on a json text

692
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
and the json data may not be presented

693
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,079
in a way that

694
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:59,359
that provides any

695
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,319
ordering to the map entry so for

696
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:02,960
instance

697
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,800
javascript tends to to put numeric

698
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,280
map keys first and and then the the

699
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,280
other map keys and so on so there is

700
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,240
some

701
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,319
reordering uh going on in

702
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,760
implementations

703
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,800
in python that reordering is actually

704
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,760
different between each invocation which

705
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,359
can be a lot of fun with it when you're

706
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,960
trying to debug

707
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,640
things so uh yeah

708
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,319
json objects do not have order and any

709
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,880
uh selector that actually relies on an

710
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,079
order in a

711
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,359
map is early fine of course arrays

712
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,720
do have order and i think that that

713
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,760
generally

714
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,800
if you filter an array uh the result of

715
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,079
that data

716
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,200
should have the same order that the

717
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:57,839
original array had

718
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,960
yeah i was going to make a comment about

719
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,040
the ordering of objects

720
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,680
um i think if i remember correctly the

721
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,319
only

722
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,079
uh selector component selected that

723
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,119
actually would that would impact is

724
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,640
something like an asterisk you know

725
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,319
square brackets asterisk

726
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,960
to pick out all the values of an object

727
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,839
and in that case

728
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,920
yes the output would be the order will

729
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,760
be non-deterministic

730
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,720
but i think um aside from that i think

731
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,079
ordering would work

732
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,400
um i think we just have to accept that

733
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,839
if you use that construct

734
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:39,839
then the uh that that uh

735
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,440
the nodes that would be delivered from

736
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,119
that would be in a non-deterministic

737
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,119
order in the node list

738
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,800
um but suppose someone had uh

739
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,079
introduced square bracket star

740
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,319
twice over somehow not sure exactly how

741
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:55,440
that would work

742
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,359
um then i think the removal of the

743
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,760
duplicates there afterwards still work

744
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,920
uh we'd end up with the original

745
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,920
non-deterministic order

746
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,040
um potentially so i think think it could

747
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,640
be made to work together don't think

748
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,040
uh we need to throw out ordering just

749
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,920
because of the

750
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:20,000
behavior of objects

751
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,440
it's just something to mention clearly

752
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,960
yeah you also could redefine an order

753
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,319
um so if i think

754
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,480
that that's a question that that really

755
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,520
should be an issue

756
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,359
on its own uh do we expect json path

757
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:44,960
to be deterministic um and

758
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,839
um so if you apply the same creator the

759
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:48,960
same

760
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,040
uh json data item do you get the same

761
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,400
result

762
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,440
and if if that is

763
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,559
really important to us

764
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,319
then we may have to prescribe an order

765
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,119
in which

766
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,240
this star operator returns

767
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:17,839
its values

768
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,680
sorry uh is there a better summary of

769
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,119
what you've just said and i'll make this

770
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,200
into a new issue right now maybe i just

771
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,079
just should make that issue okay that's

772
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:30,800
fine

773
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,599
playing chinese whispers yet works fine

774
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,079
for me

775
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,839
okay okay let me just express an opinion

776
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:38,880
while we're here

777
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,720
um i don't think it should be

778
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,640
deterministic in this case because i

779
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,720
think that would be too constraining

780
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,440
on the implementations and i don't think

781
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,200
it actually matters because i think

782
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,800
applying star uh to a an object

783
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,000
is um is probably a pretty rare use case

784
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,480
uh i don't think it really matters uh

785
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,240
and if you exclude that case then it

786
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,599
becomes deterministic

787
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,599
everywhere else i think you know i think

788
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,000
recursive descent is a possible area of

789
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,880
um

790
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,119
uh where we need to tighten up the order

791
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,240
but i think you could you can have a

792
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,240
well-defined order there i think

793
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,280
everywhere else

794
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,040
sequences and so on are well defined

795
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,800
perhaps this just needs to just think

796
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,079
language one that says that

797
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,480
determinism welcome for an object yes

798
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,040
okay um

799
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,520
carsten

800
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,240
yeah i'm in the middle of typing that

801
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,160
issue but anyway um

802
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:52,480
so the the processing model discussion

803
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,040
um our algorithm discussion under number

804
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,800
14

805
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,760
uh was actually pretty far along when it

806
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,960
kind of

807
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,319
derailed into

808
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,079
uh it's it's funny to

809
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,640
to see people fixing the mark down there

810
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,839
um

811
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,200
when it derailed into a discussion about

812
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,400
um what

813
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,400
we can do about recursive or nested

814
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,400
filters and so on i think that that's a

815
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,599
completely different issue

816
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,880
so it doesn't really have a bearing uh

817
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,760
on on this so i think what mainly

818
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,760
resulted from the discussion is

819
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,440
this little snippet which i have

820
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,960
slightly

821
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,800
changed so the algorithm is we start

822
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:46,400
with a node list that has the root item

823
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,680
and this node list

824
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,200
or collection or whatever you want to

825
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,960
call it

826
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,960
is then repeatedly updated

827
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,480
so we go through the jsonpath expression

828
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,480
and linearly apply each selector

829
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,400
and the selector is applied by

830
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,440
starting with an empty result collection

831
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,599
and then for each item that is

832
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,119
in the the current node list

833
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,040
we apply the selector to that one item

834
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,440
the result is an of the applying the

835
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,359
selector as a node list

836
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,280
that is appended

837
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,200
to the result list and i think that

838
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,559
that's where the first

839
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,720
little question marks are coming up what

840
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,720
exactly a pending

841
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,920
means here and then the the

842
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,000
proposal exactly that's the one i'm

843
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,440
reciting here

844
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,640
the the proposal um says the

845
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:52,000
the results are uh

846
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,079
put through an operator that is called

847
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,680
this thing that i have no idea what it

848
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,720
does

849
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,440
uh but uh some probably something about

850
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,559
duplicates

851
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,800
and that then becomes the current node

852
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,839
list

853
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,440
again and when the the path selector is

854
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,960
uh that excuse me the the path

855
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,079
expression is completed we just return

856
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,800
the current note list that makes a lot

857
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,680
of sense to me

858
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,280
except again that i don't know what

859
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,119
append and distinct

860
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,160
uh are meaning exactly

861
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,520
so there are several options not taken

862
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,319
here

863
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,440
so for instance the the selector does

864
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,280
not get the whole node list

865
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,920
the selector gets each entry of the node

866
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,559
list

867
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,520
each element of the node list in turn so

868
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,400
you cannot

869
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,480
write selectors that order note lists

870
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,160
or uh do something interesting

871
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,839
uh like build an average uh

872
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,079
you only ever get selectors that work on

873
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,520
on a single

874
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,680
uh

875
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,680
[Music]

876
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,280
note and yeah i said it's not clear what

877
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,319
this thing means

878
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,640
and i think we just already discussed

879
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,920
about

880
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,599
selectors that that take objects

881
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,440
exclusively take items out of an

882
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,040
unordered map

883
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,599
or json object i think we covered that

884
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,520
already

885
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,280
so i i would love to hear what people

886
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,960
think about this append and

887
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,960
distinct operations

888
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,000
for me the obvious meaning for append is

889
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,319
really concatenate

890
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,839
i would think the selector brackets item

891
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,680
would return a node list

892
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,480
and append would concatenate the two but

893
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,280
i admit it's it's ambiguous isn't it it

894
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,160
could be

895
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,680
you know something else uh distinct

896
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,839
i would hope runs through the node list

897
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,440
in linear order

898
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,440
and when it encounters a duplicate

899
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,440
removes the

900
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,119
later occurrence of the duplicate and

901
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:08,559
then keeps going

902
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,079
so essentially if you get the same node

903
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,920
multiple times over only the first

904
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,280
occurrence survives

905
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,200
say again what is it

906
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,040
okay um yeah appointed to this reference

907
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,839
to the same node

908
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,000
so to a node that already was in the

909
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,280
node list

910
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,839
yes

911
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,079
i'm guessing here i have no idea but

912
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:42,559
that would be my preference

913
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,319
well that's at least the strawman that

914
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,720
we can

915
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,839
discuss

916
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,480
okay i take it please uh

917
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,000
are we going to be adding some comments

918
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:17,839
onto these issues

919
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,319
um

920
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,240
that was a question is are we going to

921
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,400
put some comments onto these issues

922
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,079
uh clarifying what we've just discussed

923
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,680
i would suggest you as chair go through

924
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,119
after the meeting and

925
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,440
summarize the discussion with a link to

926
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,319
the discussion

927
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:47,440
on on each issue that we talked about

928
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,880
okay so i would expect that that someone

929
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,839
makes a pull request out of this

930
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,839
so unless there is more discussion that

931
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:05,119
calls in the question whether these

932
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,640
decisions are right

933
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,040
we can make a pull request out of that

934
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,119
and the pull request should should be

935
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,640
specific and detailed and uh

936
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,880
unambiguous enough that we really can

937
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,079
discuss it

938
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,599
in particular against the the

939
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:26,160
various uh implementation survey

940
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,119
pieces we have that we can run against

941
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,440
this

942
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,280
okay i mean maybe it's appropriate at

943
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,720
this point to then

944
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,480
discuss the way the working group

945
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,559
operates because

946
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,280
currently it's um very much in mailing

947
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:43,839
list

948
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,880
and issue mode and

949
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,920
i don't see the editors rushing to

950
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,200
produce pull requests

951
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,240
at the moment by editors i'm referring

952
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,839
to stefan and marco

953
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,920
who were the editors that we were kind

954
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,960
of expecting to

955
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,370
uh to do most of the writing um

956
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:02,559
[Music]

957
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,920
and i i too favor poor requests um

958
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,520
but it's um you know i could plow into

959
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,480
this but i'm

960
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,920
trying to hold off and focus on the

961
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,359
reference implementation and the

962
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,040
compliance test suite

963
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,400
so uh carsten were you thinking you you

964
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,319
might have time to

965
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:23,839
do a pull request for this

966
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,119
well within within the months of march

967
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:28,000
yes

968
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,559
not this week maybe not next week but

969
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,720
certainly before easter

970
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,598
great thank you yeah thank you carsten

971
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,200
okay that sounds like we've made some uh

972
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,720
good progress there um

973
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,599
that pull request can okay sounds like

974
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,839
we can put a summary on to some of these

975
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:52,400
issues

976
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,839
then uh i'll do that afterwards after i

977
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,119
uh speak to tim uh and make sure that

978
00:58:59,119 --> 00:58:59,760
he's

979
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,799
he's abreast as to what we're doing

980
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,960
um it sounds like we've made a fair work

981
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,599
of progress today

982
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,760
um with regards to this um

983
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,520
do we've uh we've talked through

984
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,920
we've talked through uh jefferies we've

985
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,599
talked through carsten's glenn have we

986
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,920
talked through yours

987
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,359
um no we can do that briefly if you like

988
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:29,280
yeah yeah um so number 27

989
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,799
actually was a one uh it's just a single

990
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:33,839
comment

991
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,920
issue and it referred mainly back to

992
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,440
number 23

993
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,480
duplicates in selector output um

994
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,480
and there was a bit of discussion back

995
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,599
and forth

996
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,559
wasn't really a consensus there but the

997
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,079
um

998
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,359
the last proposal seemed to be it wasn't

999
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,119
immediately counted so

1000
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,480
it was tending towards removing

1001
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,200
duplicate nodes but not duplicate values

1002
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,599
which is consistent i think with the

1003
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:01,359
node list idea we've been discussing

1004
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,799
today

1005
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:06,079
um it does make me wonder about certain

1006
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,040
languages

1007
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,119
um i just have the back of my mind you

1008
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,559
know things like

1009
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,400
i don't know haskell or some other

1010
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,839
languages that pass by value

1011
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,880
might be difficult to distinguish a node

1012
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,000
from a

1013
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,599
value reference from a value a duplicate

1014
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:26,400
node rather from a duplicate value

1015
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,559
but i don't have any concrete evidence

1016
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,799
there to say that's a problem

1017
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:33,599
um i wouldn't be worried so much about

1018
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,119
the languages unless there

1019
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:37,920
is already implementations in those

1020
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,599
languages

1021
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,599
yeah there isn't as far as i know so

1022
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,599
that's uh that's fine

1023
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,040
um so yeah there was

1024
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,640
interesting discussion in uh number 23

1025
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,559
about whether removal of duplicates

1026
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,480
would affect ordering

1027
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,480
and uh consequently make the spec

1028
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,240
non-deterministic but i don't think it

1029
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,119
would

1030
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,160
i think if we uh defined it carefully

1031
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,799
and said that uh later nodes were

1032
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:05,839
discarded

1033
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,559
in preference to earlier nodes sorry in

1034
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,319
favor of earlier knows

1035
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,760
then you'd get deterministic ordering

1036
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,319
um i think that could even be done

1037
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,559
during the processing of the selector

1038
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,200
stages

1039
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,400
so as soon as we end a selector stage

1040
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,319
and we going back to the previous piece

1041
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,920
of pseudo code as soon as

1042
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,240
soon as we removed the duplicates then

1043
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,680
we could continue

1044
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,119
i think that will be equivalent of

1045
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,200
running the whole lot to completion

1046
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,040
and then removing the duplicates at the

1047
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,040
end although i'd like to see the proof

1048
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,839
of that

1049
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,359
okay

1050
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:53,839
any questions on that

1051
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:03,760
it doesn't sound particularly

1052
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,839
contentious

1053
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,119
okay sounds like we've made some impact

1054
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,559
on that

1055
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,160
um just just to recap for my own

1056
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,039
own sake it sounds like in terms of uh

1057
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:23,440
sort of

1058
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,039
wrapping up this uh it sounds like

1059
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,079
that we need to well i need to

1060
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,359
as chair after i talk to tim discuss

1061
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:36,480
uh to leave a summary

1062
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,480
over what over sort of what we've

1063
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,240
concluded with

1064
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,559
uh in the meeting but that on these on

1065
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,079
these various issues

1066
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,599
uh i would say we should probably leave

1067
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,960
the issues open for the time being

1068
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,079
because if there's any further

1069
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,520
discussion about it we can

1070
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,119
keep it going um and then cast them

1071
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:00,400
when you have the time i'd be

1072
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:01,520
appreciative

1073
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,599
for your pull request um

1074
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:07,599
and i know you don't you don't have time

1075
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,039
in the next couple of weeks but

1076
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,839
uh at some point that would be kind of

1077
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,200
key

1078
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,839
um is there anything i've missed there

1079
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:29,520
no okay um

1080
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,920
i mean we have almost an hour of meeting

1081
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,280
time left

1082
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,319
sure we can go through that um

1083
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:39,760
is there anything in particular you'd

1084
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,839
like to go through next

1085
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:50,160
yeah i'm not uh i didn't really prepare

1086
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,200
for this so i'm sorry i think the other

1087
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,400
issue that got a lot of discussion is

1088
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,680
the the whole expression language um

1089
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,520
issue um

1090
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,119
well one other thing we could do is go

1091
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,839
through issue 53

1092
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:13,839
which i think it's a really useful input

1093
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,240
okay

1094
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,400
okay so

1095
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,079
this is quite a high level yes

1096
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:41,839
thing there's

1097
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:46,079
okay how do we best approach this so

1098
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,559
it looks like there's been just the one

1099
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:55,839
comment from daniel parker

1100
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,880
um i mean it seemed to me that the next

1101
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,039
step here was for someone to simply make

1102
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,319
a choice

1103
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,440
in each line of the table and then put

1104
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,960
in a pull request

1105
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,640
and i was kind of holding my breath

1106
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,799
opening up hoping that stefan would do

1107
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:11,920
that

1108
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,599
but he hasn't decided to so far so

1109
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,160
it just seemed like a coin tossing

1110
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,839
exercise really to pick on some

1111
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,839
terms

1112
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,119
i think getting terminology right is

1113
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:31,440
really

1114
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:36,319
important so

1115
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,799
some of these decisions already have

1116
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:40,720
been made i mean that they are not final

1117
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,119
but they have been made for the current

1118
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:50,720
uh document

1119
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,400
so i think that that would be another

1120
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,240
pull request i would have a lot of fun

1121
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,640
writing

1122
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,400
but the reason i was bringing this up

1123
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,079
was whether there's

1124
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,079
any any disagreement or or

1125
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:15,680
strong strong opinion uh on on any of

1126
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,680
these

1127
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,000
so other people around that believe we

1128
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,760
have to have minus

1129
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,880
characters and names

1130
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:33,520
and and things like that

1131
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,760
don't sound like it but if there is

1132
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,359
anybody's please speak up now

1133
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,559
uh the other option that we can do is uh

1134
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:47,440
reiterate this on the mailing list

1135
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,520
yeah but it's i think it's more useful

1136
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,640
to have a pull request

1137
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,559
that actually makes those decisions so

1138
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:53,920
that

1139
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,119
this is really mostly asking questions

1140
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,039
and and discussing the questions is not

1141
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,480
as interesting as

1142
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,640
discussing the answers okay

1143
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,599
now that's that's that's a fair point

1144
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,240
just

1145
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,319
checking uh you mentioned minus

1146
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,920
characters in names

1147
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,039
i didn't see that in the issue 53 i was

1148
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,440
looking at

1149
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,720
it's under the heading review

1150
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,799
oh okay the third bullet

1151
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,319
this item here oh yeah

1152
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:33,359
yep okay right thank you

1153
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,960
um there's also the script expressions

1154
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,160
point but

1155
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,559
i don't want to open a pan of worms on

1156
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,039
that one

1157
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,760
um okay

1158
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,400
on the list we kind of converged on

1159
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,760
using the terms

1160
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,960
filter expressions and index expressions

1161
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,720
so i'm not sure that that script

1162
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,280
expression is a term we would use

1163
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,680
today

1164
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,080
okay that makes sense so we we just need

1165
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,520
to pull requests put together and then

1166
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,839
we can

1167
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,359
have a very clear answer to this one

1168
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,679
okay

1169
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:37,279
so maybe you can just assign me to 53

1170
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,799
and if

1171
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,640
mentioned in in your summary that if

1172
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,319
somebody else wants to do that i'm i'm

1173
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,560
not

1174
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,600
wedded to this so i'm sure

1175
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,759
happy to pass that on so the the

1176
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:55,679
issue that i actually wanted to call up

1177
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,479
was 54 i'm sorry

1178
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,718
okay

1179
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,120
so this is really ten issues in in one

1180
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:10,479
yeah so

1181
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,719
i think the next step will be to simply

1182
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:14,319
divvy this up

1183
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,560
in two issues and some of which i think

1184
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,839
we already can close because we have a

1185
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,000
title

1186
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,719
uh but but some of which can be

1187
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,960
addressed

1188
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,600
yeah so we can we can have a quick look

1189
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,239
at 54.

1190
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,120
yeah there's this is big

1191
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,158
um is it worth us offline

1192
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:41,759
splitting this up

1193
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,158
yes maybe after this discussion we can

1194
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:47,359
do that

1195
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,319
so we can actually close some of the

1196
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,920
issues

1197
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,320
yeah okay

1198
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,320
okay just making a note of things so

1199
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,640
the first sub issue is title of the

1200
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,520
specification

1201
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,040
and stefan stated

1202
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:20,239
an agreement and i like what he stated

1203
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:21,120
there

1204
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,719
is there anything that we need to do to

1205
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:30,800
this agreement

1206
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,120
okay

1207
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:45,839
okay next item terminology

1208
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,080
so i think that the most important thing

1209
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,520
is the bullet list at the

1210
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,880
the end of this sub issue yeah

1211
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,360
and i think we have mostly implemented

1212
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,080
this so

1213
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,760
so maybe we can uh check that in the

1214
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,040
document

1215
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,159
so i think i i responded to something

1216
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:05,600
and i never know whether it's mailing

1217
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,239
list or

1218
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,280
issue that that node and item are

1219
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,840
essentially

1220
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,440
synonyms but you use them when you want

1221
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:13,920
to

1222
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,760
emphasize different aspects of it

1223
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,800
so node is really talking about the

1224
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,360
specific position

1225
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,640
in in a tree and item is

1226
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,239
just talking about what's at this uh

1227
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,880
position but in in the end they have the

1228
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,320
same meaning within this

1229
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,520
document okay

1230
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,280
i think we agreed on on member

1231
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,199
for the thing that is in an object

1232
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,880
for the key value pair and i

1233
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,000
think we had an agreement to use name

1234
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,719
value pair because that's what 8259 says

1235
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,080
not key value here

1236
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,560
that's not a choice i would have made

1237
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,840
but i think that that's what we came up

1238
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,280
with

1239
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,960
okay and finally the the thing that is

1240
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,640
in an array is called an element

1241
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,880
just uh in passing i mentioned a

1242
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,520
mathematical alternative for

1243
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,159
the name value pair or key value pair in

1244
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:29,440
an object will be maplet

1245
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:34,840
would be what we want maplet m-a-p-l-e-t

1246
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,520
oh you know if we wanted to something

1247
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,960
that was completely neutral

1248
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,679
uh from a computing point of view and a

1249
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,360
you know unique term

1250
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,440
it's got a well you know mathematical

1251
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,520
history behind that term if

1252
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,840
we wanted to use it

1253
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,920
i think member is well established and

1254
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,440
has not been abused for other things too

1255
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,840
much

1256
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,840
so

1257
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,640
but i think i think we do need to be

1258
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,330
very clear on on that terminology

1259
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:15,920
[Music]

1260
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,480
so okay shall we move on to

1261
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,239
there is a terminology section which

1262
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,480
currently has definitions

1263
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,960
like this so so essentially i take this

1264
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,719
as reaffirming

1265
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,640
uh what we have there so we have the

1266
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,120
name radio thing there we

1267
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,719
have the the item

1268
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,719
we haven't actually defined node

1269
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,480
that's interesting so do want to change

1270
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,239
that or do we always want to talk about

1271
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,718
items

1272
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,199
i think we should have i agree

1273
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,879
yeah okay okay

1274
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,960
okay so that is something that that the

1275
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,880
pr will have to address so if

1276
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,400
if the notetakers can can

1277
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,520
note this it's a very small pr but that

1278
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,159
needs to be done

1279
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,280
and i think we cannot fix the term union

1280
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,480
at this point in time

1281
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,400
that will require some more work on on

1282
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,839
that particular selector

1283
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,159
okay so we move on to the next point

1284
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,360
yeah so the differentiation thing um

1285
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,080
we have a sample plus one and of course

1286
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:43,840
i'm happy with the plus one

1287
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:49,840
then we have the x-path uh reference

1288
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,679
so do we get rid of comparison table two

1289
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,000
it sure helped me but it may be

1290
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:11,840
confusing to other people

1291
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,640
um i don't have any particularly strong

1292
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,040
thoughts

1293
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,080
i mean if it could maybe maybe it could

1294
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,760
be editorialized and

1295
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,400
and uh perhaps summarized a little bit

1296
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,560
further instead

1297
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,600
we could also push it into an appendix

1298
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,600
we could yes yeah that'd be good i think

1299
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,520
i think bringing it in earlier in the

1300
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,360
document risks

1301
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:44,239
um kind of leaning on xpath for

1302
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,000
semantics

1303
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,920
uh and being a bit unclear about the

1304
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,080
semantics in our document

1305
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,440
which i don't like so i think it

1306
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,120
appendix would be a good idea

1307
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,960
good point okay

1308
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,400
uh ray slice operator

1309
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,239
oh i don't have an opinion on that one

1310
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,320
would it make sense just splitting this

1311
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,080
out into a separate issue then

1312
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,159
yeah yeah i don't think we can make any

1313
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:20,239
progress on this

1314
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:24,559
here today okay

1315
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,560
note takers if you could make note of

1316
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,640
that please because you're probably

1317
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,960
typing faster than i can write

1318
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,840
uh unions

1319
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,040
yeah this seems to focus on the term but

1320
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,480
i think the interesting question is

1321
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,000
about duplicate

1322
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,679
uh removal um i think that that

1323
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:03,199
stefan has has a view

1324
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,080
that that is not so much emphasizing

1325
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,080
duplicate removal

1326
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,159
so that would be different from what we

1327
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,120
just said in

1328
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:17,840
in the processing model discussion

1329
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,800
okay yeah i guess if we um

1330
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,679
if we did go the way uh that we

1331
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:26,800
discussed

1332
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,400
then there could still be duplicate

1333
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,800
values in the output

1334
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,400
yes so i i think we could get away with

1335
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,600
the term union there

1336
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,080
on the understanding that it was a union

1337
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,520
of

1338
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,360
node references you know but it's

1339
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,280
it's might be a bit misleading when you

1340
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,719
look at the if you look at something

1341
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,320
like the compliance test suite you would

1342
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,199
see

1343
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,640
union producing uh apparently duplicated

1344
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:55,040
output

1345
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:58,640
duplication values

1346
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,640
well the other problem is that it's

1347
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,960
really a set operation so it doesn't

1348
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,000
uh result in an order

1349
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,120
but we we just discussed that we do want

1350
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:09,520
to

1351
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,719
create a particular order yeah

1352
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,159
very good yeah so maybe

1353
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:18,320
we should just start a contest on the

1354
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,600
mailing list

1355
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,960
replacement term for union

1356
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,840
okay

1357
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,000
uh should we move on to duplicates yes

1358
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,080
this is quite a lot of

1359
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,679
yeah but it's really focusing on arrays

1360
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:52,880
where

1361
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:55,280
i think the whole ordering discussion is

1362
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,800
obvious

1363
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,040
yep

1364
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,679
i can see that we've got some comments

1365
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,920
here

1366
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,760
i think we can just uh push

1367
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,880
this to the processing model issue

1368
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,840
yep

1369
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,000
um okay

1370
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
if nobody else has any strong opinions

1371
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,480
about that

1372
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,840
filter expressions

1373
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,400
well i like glenn's proposal of saying

1374
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,320
filter expressions only work on arrays

1375
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:50,800
because

1376
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,320
that solves one of the problems with

1377
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:57,360
ordering but i don't know how much

1378
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,280
people are relying on being able to

1379
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,640
filter

1380
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,840
map members

1381
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:14,719
okay so i think that this is an issue

1382
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,840
that requires a survey

1383
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,560
but what are people actually doing how

1384
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,480
much damage do we do when when

1385
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:29,839
we do what what then um recommends you

1386
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,239
this is be the the second stupidest

1387
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,400
question i asked today

1388
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,320
is there anything that we can learn from

1389
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,239
the interrupt tests

1390
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,440
around usage here

1391
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:47,440
yes yes okay yeah and

1392
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,800
in fact that was going to be my comment

1393
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,800
which is i think the interrupt tests are

1394
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,199
really all we've got

1395
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:57,600
yeah yeah well they don't tell us

1396
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,480
whether applications actually depend on

1397
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,960
this behavior or not

1398
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,440
however if implementations don't support

1399
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,360
it

1400
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:14,159
then they obviously can't be using them

1401
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,120
yeah it's tricky isn't it because there

1402
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,239
may be an obscure

1403
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,480
implementation that happens to be

1404
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,000
dependent upon by

1405
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,600
uh you know thousands of applications um

1406
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,960
so it's hard to tell

1407
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,719
okay is it worse than

1408
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:35,840
uh is this to be

1409
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,920
split off into a separate issue so that

1410
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,120
we can uh

1411
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,840
that analysis can be done okay

1412
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,159
okay um

1413
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:53,120
respect implementations this shouldn't

1414
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:57,840
be fairly controversial

1415
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,400
yeah i think we should have a little bit

1416
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,280
of introductory text

1417
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,679
that that explains i mean we should not

1418
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,360
overdo this but

1419
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,520
we should really explain at the

1420
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,960
beginning what the

1421
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:16,239
the consideration considerations were

1422
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:19,760
that went into this process

1423
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,920
and so i think this this is good

1424
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,000
material but it's mostly just

1425
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,040
editorial uh writing this up i don't

1426
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,960
think there is a

1427
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,840
big disagreement on the principle that

1428
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,120
of course there always will be

1429
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:33,920
disagreements

1430
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,760
on what the principle actually means in

1431
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,360
a specific

1432
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,080
case so so for instance in the filter

1433
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,280
expressions

1434
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,880
point uh my view would be that

1435
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,199
if an implementation does this this is

1436
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,120
fine but we don't have to respect that

1437
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,159
aspect

1438
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:53,840
um but yeah so it's a good motherhood

1439
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,360
and apple pie point to make in the

1440
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,960
introduction

1441
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,440
okay that sounds like uh an issue so

1442
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,560
that we can get

1443
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,760
the editorial work for it reference

1444
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,920
yeah okay and lastly we've got error

1445
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,199
handling

1446
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:13,840
yes i think we converged here

1447
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,760
yeah we just have to write it up

1448
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,120
okay so that's do we need a separate

1449
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:22,400
issue for that or

1450
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:25,440
yes always have separate issues

1451
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,040
if there is something that needs to be

1452
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,480
done there needs to be an issue

1453
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,960
reminding us that it needs to be done

1454
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,199
yep

1455
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,639
then it might be a bit too late that's

1456
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,320
all

1457
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,480
no no you can still close an issue even

1458
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,000
if it's already happening

1459
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,120
um so um my objective would be to

1460
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:45,840
actually split

1461
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,280
this issue 54 up so we can actually

1462
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,280
close issue 54

1463
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,880
because we have the other issues that

1464
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,760
completely replace it

1465
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,040
yep um going uh going through my list

1466
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,800
and i think that

1467
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,719
uh the

1468
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,120
um sorry brain fart

1469
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,920
uh it sounds like we've got a few a few

1470
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,199
issues here we've got

1471
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:18,320
uh one two we've got

1472
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,920
uh with the exception of union

1473
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,480
and duplicates everything else will be

1474
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:27,920
turned into a new issue

1475
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:29,760
this is something that i can do with tim

1476
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,400
in terms of creating the new issues

1477
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,400
um and if uh people in the working group

1478
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,679
want to

1479
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:39,600
check my homework to make sure that i

1480
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,120
haven't

1481
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:44,480
misrepresented the issues or or

1482
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,679
um said anything untoward that would be

1483
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,440
very much appreciative um and then once

1484
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,199
we've got those issues we can refer back

1485
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,080
to 54

1486
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,080
and then close them right

1487
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:00,560
so the only reason why i haven't done

1488
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,480
these issues yet is that you said you

1489
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:02,880
will

1490
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,840
be making these issues it's a pretty

1491
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,440
mechanical thing

1492
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,880
to create them yeah

1493
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,520
um and and uh boring mechanical things

1494
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:15,600
are what i'm best at

1495
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,440
um

1496
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,840
[Laughter]

1497
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,360
the first step is admitting you have a

1498
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,679
problem um

1499
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,080
so uh christina's just asked a question

1500
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,600
uh apologies for

1501
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,120
only just noticing it um

1502
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,440
christine would you like to ask it to on

1503
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:40,480
the mic or do you want me to relay it

1504
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,560
so christina asks is there any way that

1505
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,480
we could quickly resolve not to change

1506
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:45,040
the most

1507
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,639
basic uh object dot first dot second

1508
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,880
and other pathing syntax so that

1509
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,880
implementers who are using those things

1510
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,719
today can feel safer that they are not

1511
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:56,000
going to be

1512
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:08,400
get hit with a breaking change

1513
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,480
well one way to approach this would to

1514
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:11,600
be to start an

1515
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,719
examples appendix that has a few

1516
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:17,199
examples that we all agree on what the

1517
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,239
result

1518
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:23,839
needs to be

1519
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:28,239
so dollar.a.b certainly would be one

1520
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:28,639
such

1521
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,760
example where we should be very clear

1522
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:34,239
on what that means but there are little

1523
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:35,120
issues like

1524
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,719
what is it if if one of the

1525
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,520
uh items in in that sequence actually is

1526
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,000
an array

1527
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:51,840
that we haven't fully defined yet

1528
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,120
okay uh creating

1529
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,920
uh i think i think that's probably the

1530
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,840
best idea for now

1531
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,159
okay if i that sounds like another issue

1532
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,559
to create

1533
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,120
can i just ask a question of christina

1534
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,560
um

1535
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,239
is she happy with the current draft

1536
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:33,839
behavior for the for the pathing syntax

1537
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:37,280
okay great i was trying to distinguish

1538
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,199
between the current behavior in the wild

1539
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:40,960
and current behavior in the draft thank

1540
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,120
you

1541
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,000
okay cool

1542
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,920
you know it sounds like we made some

1543
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,920
progress we still have about

1544
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,440
30 minutes left on the clock

1545
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,840
um is do we want to keep going through

1546
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,440
issues or

1547
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,520
have we got enough actions to

1548
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:15,840
um to move ahead with things

1549
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:19,120
hello francesco

1550
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,960
yes hi uh i just wanted to suggest that

1551
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,000
um you the chairs organize

1552
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,840
an interim meeting

1553
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,880
sometimes between this itf and the next

1554
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,600
one

1555
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,520
and it would be good i was looking at

1556
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,520
some of the people who are active in the

1557
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,719
in the github issues and some of them

1558
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,719
seem to be in a different time zone so

1559
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,639
it might be good to have like a doodle

1560
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:49,360
poll

1561
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,480
and make sure that editors and

1562
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,360
at least these people can be present

1563
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:00,400
yep that works for me

1564
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,040
um i would uh thank you for bringing

1565
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,080
that up

1566
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,679
i was going to do it eventually um

1567
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:11,679
would just just a straw poll of people

1568
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:12,000
would

1569
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,639
would something say the approximately

1570
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:15,360
the first

1571
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:19,440
week or two of may be appropriate

1572
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,920
uh given that the next atf meeting is

1573
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,440
not until

1574
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,440
mid july if i remember correctly

1575
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,880
i'm i'm personally away on the first

1576
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,199
week of may

1577
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:41,520
second week will be okay okay

1578
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,120
um i'll i'll uh get a uh

1579
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,040
i'll put it to the mailing list with a

1580
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,560
poll uh to see

1581
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,240
what times uh work for people um

1582
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:55,120
[Music]

1583
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,760
i'll be honest and say it probably favor

1584
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,360
the

1585
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,639
times and dates for

1586
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,760
a lot of the editors that are uh editors

1587
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,719
as well as

1588
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:09,920
uh my co-chair uh but i'll put it i'll

1589
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,840
i'll create it as an action to take it

1590
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,199
to the mailing list

1591
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,560
and come up with some times and dates

1592
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,719
and we can we can set set up something

1593
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,080
in in may or even april

1594
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,280
okay shall we go through more issues or

1595
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:23,840
shall we

1596
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:34,080
uh conclude

1597
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,199
i think we've made quite a lot of

1598
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:39,120
progress today which has been very very

1599
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,560
just briefly like to point to issue 55

1600
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,080
uh which is interesting uh because it's

1601
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,120
not really an issue

1602
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,920
that that we can act on but it's a

1603
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:50,639
statement of

1604
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,760
interest from from uh

1605
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,000
standards activity that that is making

1606
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,480
use of this or plans to make use of this

1607
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:01,760
um so i i'm not sure how we will handle

1608
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,120
these things

1609
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,480
uh but it's really good information uh

1610
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:09,840
that that we need to process in in some

1611
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,719
form

1612
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,440
or another and and uh i mean we we are

1613
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:14,159
not

1614
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:16,400
doing a liaison process or anything like

1615
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,760
that here

1616
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,040
but i think it would be good to to read

1617
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,639
this issue and maybe

1618
01:31:22,639 --> 01:31:24,880
further issues we we get from from other

1619
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,920
people who

1620
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,600
who want to use this work and

1621
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,520
think about what what our response

1622
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,800
should be so if they have

1623
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,639
un unfulfillable expectations

1624
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:40,239
uh we probably should say that um

1625
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:43,040
or if there are activities that needs

1626
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,000
need to be split

1627
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,600
off and and are not currently in in the

1628
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,360
purview of this group we shall try to

1629
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:56,480
to detect that okay

1630
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,760
uh now that sounds completely reasonable

1631
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,199
um

1632
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,280
looks like there's been some discussion

1633
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,880
on this

1634
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,000
um might it be of use

1635
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,560
i don't recall seeing this posted to the

1636
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,600
mailing list

1637
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,040
would it be an idea to do so

1638
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,920
yeah i think it would be good to to have

1639
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,600
a pointer to that

1640
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,280
in in the mailing list and maybe have a

1641
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:34,480
discussion too of that in the meeting

1642
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,718
okay

1643
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,360
okay cool i guess we could

1644
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,840
discuss the use of the issue tracker

1645
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,679
versus mailing list

1646
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:47,520
if people would like to discuss that

1647
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,920
briefly

1648
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,719
sure um uh

1649
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:58,560
however i think the the position the

1650
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:00,400
position

1651
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,000
that um myself and tim have made on that

1652
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,320
hasn't really changed but if it's not

1653
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,320
working for the working group

1654
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:11,199
um if people want to chime in with any

1655
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:12,800
any views that they have i'd like to

1656
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,040
hear them

1657
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:16,560
i was just going to say i wonder if we

1658
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,239
should try to

1659
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,719
distill discussion in the mailing list

1660
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:22,480
into issues

1661
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,600
because i feel that um we're kind of in

1662
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,440
two camps at the moment some people that

1663
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,120
prefer the main list

1664
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:30,800
some people prefer issues and there's a

1665
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:36,159
slight disorganization about it

1666
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:40,159
i think that generally the

1667
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:44,320
issues are good for getting granularity

1668
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,679
into the process so if we

1669
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:51,520
identify things in in the meandering

1670
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:54,159
mailing list discussion that actually

1671
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:56,560
start to be actionable

1672
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,280
uh so it's just a question where we need

1673
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,040
to collect information and then make a

1674
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,320
decision

1675
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,239
these should always be converted into

1676
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:06,480
issues so people can start

1677
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,960
writing pull requests uh because pull

1678
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,880
requests really should be

1679
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,239
closing issues so uh i mean we

1680
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:16,080
may occasionally have pull requests that

1681
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,840
don't have an issue but

1682
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,760
the normal situation would be we have an

1683
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,679
issue we have identified a problem we

1684
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,120
have had some discussion

1685
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:25,360
and then somebody writes a pull request

1686
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,040
and and closes that

1687
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,639
so that that should be the normal

1688
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:31,040
progression of things as they move into

1689
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,560
the

1690
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,520
draft but we also might have the inverse

1691
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,360
progression where something is raised in

1692
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,120
an issue and it turns out it's just a

1693
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:40,239
wider issue

1694
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:42,639
and it's not actionable in in the same

1695
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:46,159
sense and then we should

1696
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:47,760
point to the issue in the mailing list

1697
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,520
or even start the discussion

1698
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,960
in the mailing list okay

1699
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,639
that's good i mean maybe some maybe we

1700
01:34:54,639 --> 01:34:56,480
need to go through the list of issues

1701
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,560
and flex some of the things as

1702
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,719
requiring further discussion you know so

1703
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:02,480
take it back to the mailing list in some

1704
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,719
sense

1705
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:07,760
sounds good that's good

1706
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:11,280
okay enable for free

1707
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,840

1710
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:25,920

1711
