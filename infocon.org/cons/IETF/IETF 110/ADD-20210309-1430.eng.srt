david i don't think that that photograph

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,520
is quite accurate anymore care wise

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,520
no um it's uh

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,119
it's been a year hasn't it everybody

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,439
i was like you until about two weeks ago

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,640
then i finally got the chop

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,960
so there is there is a future at

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
barbershop so you never know

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,520
uh we have a pretty packed agenda today

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,560
uh so

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,000
uh we're in the first five minutes here

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,439
we've done our jabless drive we've done

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,560
about well

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
uh this is the agenda today we'll have

50
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,000
two sessions this week uh

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
the first one is a one hour session

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,680
today where we're gonna attempt to cover

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
uh uh two of the drafts that the working

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,680
group is adopted

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
and then on thursday we have a second

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,840
session on march 11th

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,599
and we're gonna that's a two hour

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,959
session which will allow us for even

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,879
more extended discussion

60
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,239
the format for today's uh session and

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,680
i'll call for a agenda

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,840
in a second uh is a little bit of a

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
different than we've used in the past so

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,680
we the agencies always thrive thrived

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
really well

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,519
when given the opportunity to discuss

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,400
things and and

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,239
and has really rejected the idea of

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,760
being sort of a passive listener for an

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,440
extended period of time

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
so what we've done now with these two

72
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,280
adopted working group drafts

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
is ask the uh the editors the authors to

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,319
pull out the issues that they need to

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
raise the group and to discuss

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,159
and to make those be the slides to get

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,840
presented out and so the format we're

78
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,040
going to follow today

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
is a very interactive one where uh at

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
each slide

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,000
issue discussion will be presented and

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,560
we will

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,640
uh open up the mic line for people to

84
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
make comments on that

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
issue and try to capture them and then

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,440
once that's done in a reasonable amount

87
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,159
of time

88
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,640
we'll move on to the next uh slide and

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,560
the next set of issues

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,319
so hopefully that works out really well

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,920
and hopefully we have enough time today

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
to cover all this

93
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,959
if we can't carry all of this we'll roll

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,480
whatever is remaining from today

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,319
into the beginning of the thursday

96
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,599
session

97
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,599
so with all that said does anybody have

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
an agenda bash or issues they want to

99
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,680

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,759
so we're gonna cover the open issues on

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,040
the ddr draft

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,840
uh next slide

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
issues 2 and 5 cover the use of address

128
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
hints

129
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
as listed there our plans to address

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,800
these

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,120
are to revise the document to point out

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,000
that resolvers should include the hints

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
and that clients should use the ip

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
address hints until there are

135
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,479
a quad a values this is in regards to

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,240
the sv svcb draft which points out that

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,000
hints are only to be used until the

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
names can be resolved

139
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
um connections using those hints

140
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,520
should or must meet the same cert

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
requirements meaning that

142
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
the ddr process for confirming that the

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,440
cert name covers their referring ip

144
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,080
address

145
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,840
still applies um shares i don't know do

146
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,880
you want to

147
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,960
go through slides and then do questions

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
or do questions

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
i i think let's uh dress them as little

150
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,440
bite-sized morsels this time so uh ben

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,800
schwartz is okay

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,520
ready to comment

153
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
hi uh so for for ip hints

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,240
i don't why do we need any why do we

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,440
need any special text here

156
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,960
right now the draft doesn't indicate or

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,080
rather the draft

158
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,880
just says that the process stops there

159
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,280
and

160
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,720
the issue is is that a compliant svbc

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,000
client needs to continue on um you could

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,400
say

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,639
that just referring to the draft covers

164
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
that

165
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
so what i mean is you know why are we

166
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,160
why are we even discussing hints in this

167
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,960
um

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,039
you know apart from saying these keys

169
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,680
are allowed

170
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,560
the idea is that a resolver should

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
provide them to speed the process

172
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
up because otherwise there's an

173
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,440
additional round trip to resolve the

174
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,840
name

175
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,160
which itself if the client has no

176
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
encrypted dns connection yet

177
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,479
is uh subject to attack

178
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,840
okay um

179
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,479
i think i think we should give that a

180
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,680
little more thought in particular i

181
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
think that's only true

182
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,638
um if target name is not empty

183
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,039
fair or or rather non-default

184
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,680
noted thank you

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
okay thanks ben um we can go to the next

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,840
slide

187
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,880
oh well last call any other issues here

188
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,199
to comment

189
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,919
okay thank you

190
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000
glenn yep so issues three and four

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
are regarding the security

192
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
considerations um

193
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,599
one being concern around the use of a

194
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,199
private ip address is

195
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,000
as a security mechanism um we need to

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,759
clarify that that's not the case

197
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,240
uh the private ip address identification

198
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
is conducted

199
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
only to decide when to enforce

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
uh same address use meaning that

201
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,879
if a private ip address is advertised

202
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,800
then um we're in an opportunistic mode

203
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,000
meaning that we should only connect

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
if we are connecting to the same ip

205
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
address and we can skip the name

206
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,800
certification check this is because in

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,280
this

208
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,919
mode we don't have an option for strong

209
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,879
authentication

210
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,400
and so we want to make sure we don't

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,479
worsen our current situation

212
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,560
um which means that we will only send

213
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,479
encrypted traffic to the same ip address

214
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,919
that we would have to send

215
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,719
unencrypted traffic in the event of no

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,320
bootstrapping at all

217
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
and then for the other issue um

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,039
clarifying that the target name is

219
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,920
required for a proper https

220
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,800
connection um making sure that the doe

221
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,880
bootstrap is the same

222
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,600
has the same security features as an any

223
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,440
other https connection

224
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
and then the referring ip address is

225
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,120
required for validating the insecure

226
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
bootstrap

227
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,120
so that the client knows that the

228
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,080
referral was

229
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,480
agreed upon by both parties

230
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,519
next slide please uh or

231
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,399
questions yep any feedback here i'm just

232
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,360
double checking

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,959
chat um sometimes i'll like uh eric on

234
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,320
the previous slide had a question that

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,920
probably would have been good to just

236
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,519
bring up to everybody but

237
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,600
it looks like we can move on for this

238
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,959
slide

239
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,839
oh ben's back

240
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,440
so sorry could you perforation number

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
four

242
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,160
i i thought we had consensus that we

243
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,200
don't

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,160
need multiple name checks on a single

245
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,640
certificate

246
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,000
so the need for both of these is laid

247
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,440
out is this something

248
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,600
you disagree with i don't recall the

249
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
consensus you're referring to

250
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,560
okay yes uh this is i i disagree with

251
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,040
this

252
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
um okay i guess this isn't surprising

253
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
because i proposed a

254
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,320
a substantial revision to this draft

255
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,480
a while back that among other things

256
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
changes this behavior

257
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,240
[Music]

258
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,160
so i guess we'll we'll have time to talk

259
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
about that

260
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,240
um okay we could

261
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
talk about it a little more right now

262
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
yeah if you agree

263
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
um okay ben's back i see you there echo

264
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
let's finish up this

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,120
so i'll just say i think this

266
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,320
overall i think the the draft uh the

267
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,040
draft

268
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,200
contains some some incorrect analysis

269
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
about where the trust anchors are in

270
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,360
this in this system about what sources

271
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,640
of information are trust

272
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
identifiers and which ones aren't about

273
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
which ones need to be in certificates

274
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,079
and which ones don't

275
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,600
uh and uh and as a result i think comes

276
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
to an incorrect conclusion

277
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
about how to deal with the uh the

278
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
question of cross ip

279
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
upgrade um i don't think that this

280
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,200
changes the fundamental structure of the

281
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,040
draft i think that this can be dealt

282
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,399
with as a

283
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,920
um as an update but

284
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,760
i do there are some substantial

285
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,439
revisions that i want to this draft

286
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,279
okay thank you ben uh ecker please

287
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,560
unless glenn is a priority yeah

288
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,839
oh i don't need to be a priority

289
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,920
interrupt i just don't want to be thank

290
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,200
you

291
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,880
um so um i guess my

292
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
understanding of the reasoning here is i

293
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,160
start and i want to ask

294
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,839
and so let's actually let's get a step

295
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
back from like from uh

296
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
from this case and look at the general

297
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,079
case so like i start under https

298
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,200
and um you know i get a service b record

299
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
that says you know you might want to go

300
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,800
over here um and that's effectively a c

301
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,279
name

302
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,560
and then when i go over there i expect

303
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,079
to see the same certificate identity

304
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,880
that i

305
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,959
initially typed in right um or initially

306
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,480
referencing and so i think the question

307
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:06,959
and so

308
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
similarly the requirement in this case

309
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,040
the minimum requirement the certificate

310
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,839
has to contain

311
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,600
the name that i started with and then

312
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
the question is does it also need to

313
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,680
contain a name

314
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,560
that is different than anything i

315
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
started with and um

316
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,639
um uh i'm not aware of a security reason

317
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,320
why it needs to be so i think is that

318
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
ben is that the issue you're raising or

319
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
i'm um or is it a different issue that

320
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,319
you're raising

321
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,639
i you know i'm not sure that i can

322
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,320
summarize this all

323
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,800
um okay you know in a nutshell here

324
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,720
except to say we we just need to be very

325
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,920
clear about

326
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,959
which pieces of information are our

327
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,200
our starting points um and

328
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,040
the this draft has a few different modes

329
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,560
essentially i think in each mode we just

330
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,079
need to be very clear about

331
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,000
what is our initial identifier the thing

332
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
that we're holding on to

333
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,519
that tells us what the what the resolver

334
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,959
is and then you know that's the only

335
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,440
thing that we need to be checking

336
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,839
right i mean so i mean so i mean the

337
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,639
reason

338
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,360
the the situation is i understand it is

339
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,920
that

340
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,200
i started with like you know um you know

341
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,639
like i'm an example.com and i started

342
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,760
being told i should be going to

343
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,279
anaesthetic example.com right

344
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,120
and i don't trust any information i

345
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,480
receive um

346
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,360
allegedly from nsnexample.com overdose53

347
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,639
and so

348
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,399
then the minimum requirement is that

349
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,680
when i connect to the thing i finally

350
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
connect to it better like still realize

351
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,000
that example.com

352
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,120
or be able to demonstrate it i think

353
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,279
that's the the that's the reasoning you

354
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,560
end up with in this case um but yeah i

355
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,199
think it's

356
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
ben's like layout in each case like what

357
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,199
the chain of security reasoning is that

358
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,800
gets us the point of being okay

359
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,639
um i don't necessarily mind it having

360
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
both names but i don't think it has to

361
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,440
have

362
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,680
um they're for every address

363
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,639
uh thank you uh ecker and ben

364
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,079
glenn please hey so

365
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,279
ben i think you're bringing up some

366
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,120
really good considerations here

367
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,360
and i'm wondering if maybe it would be

368
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,600
useful uh both for the discussion right

369
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,720
now but for people

370
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
looking back at this discussion from the

371
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,079
future trying to understand the

372
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,000
decisions we made and why

373
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,680
if you could maybe try to capture some

374
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,440
of that that thinking

375
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,279
of you know the order of these things

376
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,120
and what we need to be

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,000
actually properly using for the uh the

378
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,959
establishment

379
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,519
and then maybe a few words on what we

380
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,040
should be using for the establishment

381
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,959
either captured in this document or even

382
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,480
as a separate document

383
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,519
uh because i think it's a really

384
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,279
valuable conversation to have and if the

385
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,240
people

386
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
um that are so deeply invested in it

387
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
right now

388
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
are sort of bouncing around a little bit

389
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,279
on this

390
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,880
maybe capturing that would be a very

391
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,720
valuable thing to help the group

392
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
understand better but also i think long

393
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,320
term for people looking back

394
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,480
and understand why we made the choices

395
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
we did make

396
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
so i'm trying to give you some work ben

397
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,120
thank you glenn tommy paulie please

398
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,880
hello um yeah so

399
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,399
i think you know we definitely should

400
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,240
iterate on this and

401
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
clarify things to give a concrete

402
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,880
example

403
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,079
um and maybe ben or wrecker if you want

404
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,000
to comment on this

405
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,760
the thing i'm thinking of my head is you

406
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,199
know let's say that the thing i start

407
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,120
with is that the user typed in

408
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,720
1.1.1.1 as

409
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,680
their preferred dns server and so that's

410
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,639
the only thing i know to start with

411
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,240
so i'm going to if for some reason

412
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
that's going to point me somewhere else

413
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,560
i want to validate so

414
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,639
let's say it points me to a v6 address

415
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,560
that actually serves

416
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,600
um quad one i want to validate that you

417
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,959
can

418
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,800
cover the original address i started

419
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,639
with

420
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,759
but also if i'm doing do here

421
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,800
and you've told me hey yeah you're doing

422
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,920
https you have this authority you have a

423
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
name that you're actually having to ask

424
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
for cloudflare.dns.com

425
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,399
and a given path it would seem very odd

426
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
to tell the client no

427
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,720
do not check that the http servers

428
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,160
tls server that you're going to has

429
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,079
the correct name in the authority that

430
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,440
you're using

431
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,880
in your http request so

432
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,839
i i think the logic here is that you

433
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,360
know you cover

434
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,639
the ip address because that's the

435
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,399
original identifier you started with

436
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,959
but if you are going forward and making

437
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,959
http requests with an authority that's a

438
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,320
different name

439
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
or doing further svcb lookups to find

440
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,839
other properties off of the dns

441
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,000
svcb record based on that name not the

442
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,120
address

443
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,320
you would want to make sure that you

444
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,839
have a legitimate name

445
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,679
uh thank you uh ben kadek please

446
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,240
uh wow tommy is a tough hack to follow

447
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,679
but i think

448
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,160
i wanted to try and sort of reframe the

449
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:18,799
same

450
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,079
topics that ben and eric were covering

451
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
in terms of sort of the standard rc

452
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,000
6125 certificate validation procedures

453
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,720
so like

454
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,440
in general when you're doing tls you

455
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,280
start out making some sort of connection

456
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,720
and you have some identifier for the

457
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,799
server you're trying to contact

458
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,039
and so you you have your initial

459
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,240
identifier for the thing you're trying

460
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,240
to contact and you do tls and the server

461
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
gives you a certificate

462
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
and now you have to ask do i trust this

463
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,559
certificate

464
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,240
for the name i'm trying to contact and

465
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
that's just overall

466
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,360
general thing and so

467
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,720
in this case like the initial name

468
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,240
you're trying to contact would be the ip

469
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
address as i think both

470
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,679
ben ecker uh and

471
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
you can possibly try and say

472
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,360
that the ip address is going to be the

473
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,039
authority for what you're doing in the

474
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,360
http sense but that's not a great fit

475
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
and you know what tommy paulie said

476
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,160
makes some amount of sense

477
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,679
uh but i think that

478
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,400
coming at this from the model that 6125

479
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,679
uses in terms of

480
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,520
you know i have a connection and i need

481
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,440
to authenticate that connection against

482
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
the initial identifier i used to to

483
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
start making that connection

484
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
is going to be pretty valuable here and

485
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,600
if we want to maybe

486
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,760
also do other stuff in addition to that

487
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,559
that might be okay

488
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,559
but i think we need to keep in mind the

489
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,160
core fundamental model of

490
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,679
authenticate the initial connection i

491
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,160
tried to make

492
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,440
thank you ben and in a novel approach

493
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
tommy has joined the queue

494
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,559
for himself well i didn't know

495
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,480
i didn't want to go interrupting people

496
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
um so i thought

497
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,679
models everyone else um to

498
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,000
to highlight what tommy said especially

499
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,039
um

500
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,559
in uh the comments context there are two

501
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,440
pieces of

502
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,039
identity required because there are

503
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,559
actually two different identities being

504
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,360
confirmed

505
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
um a more interesting case that points

506
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,039
this out is one where

507
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,080
the initial dns server ip address and

508
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,640
the

509
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,960
referred doe server ip address are

510
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,840
different

511
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,559
um so if i reach out to a resolver that

512
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,799
has ip address one two three four

513
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,360
over plain text dns and it tells and it

514
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
gives back a service record that says

515
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
you should connect to do template dot

516
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,200
example

517
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,240
at ip address 5678

518
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
i need to make sure that the tls

519
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,880
certificate can claim both

520
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,160
dozer.example for all the reasons

521
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,840
already described that's the identity of

522
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,679
the server i'm trying to connect to

523
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,160
um that information alone establishes

524
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,039
the identity of

525
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
the destination resolver but the other

526
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
thing that i'm trying to confirm

527
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
is that this resolver was expecting

528
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,520
uh what is that one two three four

529
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,039
and uh doe server.example

530
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,760
are cooperating um and that i wasn't

531
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,120
hijacked to a

532
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,360
attacker's doze server and so i'm

533
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,039
checking for one two three four within

534
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,080
the certificate

535
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,600
to ensure that uh the destination

536
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,679
also controls the original person that i

537
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,960
was talking with

538
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
um and so there's two different things

539
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,080
we're trying to confirm which is why

540
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,120
there are two different pieces of

541
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,840
information included

542
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,039
thank you tommy and unfortunately that

543
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,280
window as i had to silence that was my

544
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,960
notification i went okay i'm back uh

545
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
eric

546
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
right so i think we had a bunch of

547
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
discussion in the jubber um so maybe

548
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,360
like it will have people

549
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,400
um uh uh so this analogy

550
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
um i think there are two ways to think

551
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
about this uh

552
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,240
this indicator this svcp indicator one

553
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,480
is

554
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,559
like a c name um and the other is like a

555
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:03,760
302

556
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,919
and in a c name what you do when you get

557
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,200
to the other side is you spend

558
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,880
as you expect the authority and you

559
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,960
expect the um certificate to match the

560
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,240
original thing you started with

561
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,960
and at 302 the we expect is to connect

562
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,679
to the thing

563
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,200
and get like an authoritative an

564
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
authoritative like indication

565
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,320
of for the original person you're

566
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,440
talking to and then get bounced

567
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,720
somewhere else and then you specify that

568
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,000
person authoritatively

569
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
um and um and so like

570
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
this isn't like not a perfect fit for

571
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,559
either of these because like it's all

572
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
one jumbled on one thing but if your

573
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,039
metal model

574
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,559
is it's like a c name then you're like

575
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,919
hey i only need the first thing if your

576
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,440
metal metal is at 302

577
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,320
then you need both and i think that the

578
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,640
um

579
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,320
and one thing that came up in this issue

580
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,080
is if you're doing so if you're doing

581
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,600
dot this is like somewhat less clear but

582
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,799
if you're doing dough

583
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,320
is like you know um is what are you

584
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
shoving in the host header and what are

585
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,799
you

586
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,640
um when you do the query and is it the

587
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,840
original ip address

588
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,520
or whatever you can figure with or is it

589
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,960
the thing that was stuffed in the svcp

590
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,440
record

591
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
and i agree with tommy that if it's the

592
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,039
second then it is really goofy

593
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,480
to be like um sorry if if if if you know

594
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,159
if you started with 1.1.1

595
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,840
and then it got bounced you to you know

596
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,080
cloudflare.cns.com

597
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
um and that's what you're putting in

598
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
like the host center in the url then

599
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,240
it's like super goofy to not check the

600
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,640
stuff

601
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,960
for that um that that seems like for us

602
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,080
since it'd be unfortunate

603
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,280
so i think maybe that's the way to think

604
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,000
about it rather than a certificate issue

605
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,760
you ecker ben schwartz please

606
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,440
so i think we have consensus that in

607
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,559
this context

608
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,840
we do need the ip address in

609
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,000
the certificate um the reason why

610
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,880
the i think the core reason why i don't

611
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,240
want us to have to put

612
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,799
the an additional name also in the

613
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,000
certificate

614
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,280
is that it's first of all it doesn't

615
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,679
provide an additional security property

616
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,280
really

617
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
at least not if you actually trust that

618
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,280
ip addresses and certificates mean i

619
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,679
control this ip address

620
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,200
but secondly

621
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,720
it breaks the http abstraction barrier

622
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,840
if the only thing that's needed is

623
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,559
to um is to put the ip address in the

624
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,679
certificate

625
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,760
then we have a relatively

626
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,280
straightforward way to pass this

627
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,159
information across to an http stack

628
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,360
and say you know here's the here's the

629
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,158
url that you're supposed to connect to

630
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
and you know here here's a url it

631
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,679
contains an authority component that's

632
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,960
the name that you're

633
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,919
checking for uh in the in the

634
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,480
certificate

635
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,400
if we if we start requiring multiple

636
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,679
names then

637
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,240
it gets very uh it gets very confusing

638
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
uh it no longer is something that you

639
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,840
can

640
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,039
easily plug into a stock https client

641
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,039
stack

642
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,400
and i do think that you know this is

643
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,159
there is a close analogy here to the way

644
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,520
that we use cdns

645
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,960
generally you know we do not ask clients

646
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,279
to when they follow a cname record in

647
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,640
the dns we do not ask

648
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,080
clients to validate that the destination

649
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,440
contains both

650
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,559
the name of the authority and the name

651
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,440
of the cdn

652
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,039
even though they do know both of those

653
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,360
names they could double check and it

654
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
would probably work most of the time

655
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,480
but there's there's no requirement that

656
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,760
it be set up that way

657
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,879
thank you ben dkg

658
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,279
um so uh following on to ben's point

659
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,320
there

660
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,240
about can we just pass this information

661
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,480
to a stock http stack

662
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,200
i am not convinced that we have great ip

663
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,919
address

664
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,799
cert checking in all the stock http

665
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,720
stacks themselves so there's already a

666
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
question about compatibility there

667
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,440
but i but i actually do agree with ben's

668
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,919
point that asking a stock hdv stack to

669
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,840
check multiple names

670
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,919
in the course of a single connection is

671
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,080
a really unusual requirement

672
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,159
and so i would want to ask what do we

673
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,520
think the specific

674
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,480
gain is from having to check both of

675
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
those things

676
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,880
for the folks who would advocate for

677
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
checking both of those things

678
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,320
what it what does the system as a whole

679
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,520
or the client or the server gain

680
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,840
from having both checks in place like

681
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
what is the specific thing that's being

682
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,799
gained there i think that might be

683
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,559
clarifying to hear a specific answer to

684
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
that

685
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,840
thank you tommy pauly please

686
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,039
all right um so

687
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,240
i i definitely hear the point that if we

688
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,559
have

689
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,720
an ip address would be sufficient

690
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
um i think if that is the case and

691
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,559
that's all you are validating

692
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
i think we would want to say that for

693
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,919
the case

694
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,480
of dough and everything else you would

695
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,159
have to treat

696
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,679
the authority for hp purposes

697
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:13,760
as the ipa address and that's definitely

698
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,279
acceptable

699
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,159
um i think perhaps

700
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,840
we could go with the solution of saying

701
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,600
yeah from the ddr perspective the only

702
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,000
thing you

703
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,400
absolutely need is the ipa address but

704
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,679
then have an addendum

705
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,640
that says if you want to use an

706
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,600
authority

707
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,439
that is the name that you learned

708
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,720
then you must also validate that before

709
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,360
using that name as an authority or using

710
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,480
it for future operations

711
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,080
for a very simple case in which there's

712
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,159
a pretty one-to-one mapping

713
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,760
between these things it doesn't matter

714
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,120
i could imagine a case in which perhaps

715
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,600
we have

716
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,720
different

717
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,200
names essentially like different sni's

718
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,279
that are hosted on the same address that

719
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,080
do have different meanings to a

720
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
particular

721
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,200
client let's say the

722
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,320
the stack has a list

723
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,960
like some stacks do i think you know

724
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,360
firefox and microsoft currently do

725
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,399
of names of resolvers that they

726
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,080
have preference for or that they already

727
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
know they trust

728
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,279
if i saw

729
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,679
an address that said oh yes i actually

730
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,120
am designating over to

731
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,640
one of these names that you already do

732
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,840
trust then we could in that case

733
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,080
validate the address and then validate

734
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,360
the name if we prefer

735
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,600
for some system reason to use that name

736
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,720
no you don't have to

737
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
but if you want to use the name then you

738
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
should kind of do the standard

739
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,320
validation that you would for the

740
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,720
authority

741
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,039
thank you tommy eric worth please

742
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,720
yeah tommy actually just made most of

743
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,120
the point i was about to make myself

744
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,440
but yeah a lot of these cases where the

745
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
one the one case where i can think of

746
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,080
where it would be useful to clients to

747
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
have this name is if

748
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
the clients want to say refer to a white

749
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,159
list of

750
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,440
names they're willing to upgrade to and

751
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
such they need to be able to make sure

752
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,320
this is the thing that matches our white

753
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:20,799
list

754
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,399
for the most part this doesn't seem like

755
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,919
it applies to the general case for the

756
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,120
most part

757
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
if you want to use a white list of known

758
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,399
things well then you can also use

759
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,720
your same list for auto upgrading like a

760
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,559
lot of clients are doing today

761
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,880
so that's kind of like why would you be

762
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,640
using ddr if you want to do that but

763
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
i could kind of imagine there might be

764
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
cases where clients might optionally

765
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,840
want to do checks like that

766
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,039
so in the very least i think it's very

767
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,000
reasonable to say

768
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
optionally clients should be able to

769
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,520
check against the

770
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,840
the target name as well but i don't

771
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
think it needs to be a must

772
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
because the the core thing that most

773
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,000
clients are going to want to check

774
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,720
against

775
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,919
i think we get all the security

776
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,120
properties we need just from the ipa

777
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,439
address

778
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,080
uh thank you ralph is currently the last

779
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,200
one in the queue and so

780
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,960
let's please wrap up this discussion so

781
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,320
we can move on to the next it's been a

782
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,360
great conversation

783
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,480
but uh ralph vapor please yeah so i

784
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,039
agree that we should use kind of one

785
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,240
thing as the trust anchor to to have and

786
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,320
there is also a section in there when we

787
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
are coming from a name

788
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,360
that i think is the biggest there

789
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,120
section five where we say

790
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
if there are sort of two targets we'll

791
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,399
check sort of

792
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,159
the source and the destination i think

793
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,080
we should have the same stuff there

794
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,480
i mean just use if we are starting with

795
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,880
a name use the initial name

796
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,039
as the kind of name you're checking and

797
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,640
if you're starting with an ip

798
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,559
use the initial ip as the stuff you are

799
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,120
checking with it

800
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,240
okay thank you rob

801
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,919
thank you everyone um that was pretty

802
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,559
helpful

803
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,279
so i will update the issue with the

804
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,080
discussion

805
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,120
um but we need to move forward

806
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,360
um so we'll take the rest to list in

807
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
github

808
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
issues numbers six and seven deal with

809
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,840
the special use domain name and

810
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,640
forwarders

811
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,039
um this is pretty straightforward uh we

812
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,960
plan to revise the document

813
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,200
to highlight that resolvers should only

814
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,880
ever answer

815
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,600
queries for themselves and otherwise

816
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,840
should always return annex domain

817
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,880
um there is

818
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
an asterisk there for the special case

819
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
where you may have a 100

820
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,360
blind forwarder um and

821
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,399
one may choose to forward the

822
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,760
s vcb record from upstream um but will

823
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,159
include

824
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,919
verbiage that calls out the implementer

825
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,520
should be aware that this will likely

826
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,159
result in client authentication failure

827
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,720
unless the certificate can claim the i p

828
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,320
address of the blind forwarder as well

829
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,120
ben please

830
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,240
so this is a fundamental scope question

831
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,399
i think that this really is of general

832
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,399
interest to the add group

833
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,399
because the the question is do we want

834
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,240
to try to enable encrypted dns

835
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,080
do we want to try to at least make it

836
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,840
possible for clients

837
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,360
to do encrypted dns uh

838
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,519
through legacy customer equipment

839
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,799
so if i have a if i'm at home as i am

840
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,200
now

841
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,720
with a forwarder on my uh on my

842
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,000
wi-fi access point that's pointed to my

843
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
isps resolver

844
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,360
um can i get and it doesn't do anything

845
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,840
it does this forward queries and forward

846
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,279
responses

847
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,799
can i or can i not uh

848
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,840
get an encrypted dns connection to my

849
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
isp

850
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,840
without having to replace my access

851
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,480
point

852
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,919
there are i know there are a lot of

853
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,919
people in this working group who believe

854
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,679
that that's an important use case that

855
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,320
they want to enable

856
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,559
i've heard a lot of demand for that and

857
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,919
we need to be really clear that the

858
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,279
draft

859
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,720
currently does not enable that use case

860
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
it it does not support upgrade in that

861
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,360
case

862
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,159
i believe that it is possible for us to

863
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,600
enable a secure

864
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,360
upgrade mechanism in that case and i've

865
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
written the text

866
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,279
as a suggestion to the authors of how

867
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,000
that would

868
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,760
be laid out but

869
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
you know ultimately it's up to the

870
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,039
working group to decide

871
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,600
whether we want to include that in the

872
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,250
scope of this draft

873
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,399
[Music]

874
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,879
thank you ben

875
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,159
so i believe we'll touch on this in the

876
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,840
next slide

877
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,240
i.e the scope of the draft agreed that

878
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,960
the issue

879
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,279
definitely exists and i i will say it is

880
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,080
important

881
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,640
as written as you say that scenario is

882
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,440
out of scope

883
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,480
because right now we don't see a path

884
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,320
forward that would allow that

885
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,279
to be secured having said that um i know

886
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,640
you and others feel differently and so

887
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,600
that's a point of

888
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,320
discussion but right now um we should

889
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,600
definitely clarify

890
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,159
until future text is added that that

891
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,760
scenario is specifically out of scope

892
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,480
next slide please

893
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,399
so the final pair of issues on github

894
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,679
are eight and nine which talk about

895
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,640
document scope

896
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
um we should specify when local

897
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,039
forwarders represent upstream resolvers

898
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,880
and why is the special use name

899
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,960
necessary for opportunistic scenarios

900
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,799
so the clarifications we're proposing in

901
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,159
the document are

902
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,000
local forwarders designating upstream

903
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,279
revolt resolvers

904
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,399
is out of scope asterisk unless

905
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,720
that uh unless the recommended doe

906
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
resolver can in fact claim the identity

907
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,559
of the local forwarder but

908
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,120
the point is the everyday scenario here

909
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,919
that can't

910
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,000
be true because a local forwarder is a

911
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,480
local ip address

912
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,639
the need for resolver metadata in the

913
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,079
opportunistic case

914
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,440
the reason we need the special use

915
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,199
domain name is so that we can retrieve

916
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,839
things like

917
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,879
do you use a non-default port number the

918
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,159
name to be used

919
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,320
in the cert checking although that

920
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
references the issue we were discussing

921
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,599
earlier that perhaps that's not a must

922
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,040
and more of a should

923
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,440
um but those are the reasons we require

924
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,599
it

925
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,399
and that's the last slide so okay uh

926
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,119
eric

927
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,000
like the comment please sort of

928
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
continuing the discussion of

929
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,159
ben's argument and his talking about his

930
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,359
previous proposal i don't remember

931
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,679
exactly what the proposal was but

932
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,879
i kind of recall that yeah it's

933
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,119
kind of in the gray area that's might be

934
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,480
okay for

935
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
some clients desires for security

936
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,800
properties and not for others and

937
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
obviously it's obvious again i don't

938
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
remember the exact proposal that well so

939
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,040
this might be

940
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,280
something to examine further but i think

941
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,440
maybe we should make it the case that

942
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,200
we just call it as optional whether or

943
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
not a client wants to support that and

944
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,880
have it in the draft because it is an

945
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,960
important area to solve if we can solve

946
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,760
and

947
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,440
maybe it's the case that a lot of

948
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,800
clients will say no security's not good

949
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,680
enough for that now

950
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,560
but later on down the line without any

951
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,520
actual

952
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,119
changes needed to the draft but just

953
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,040
changes to the ecosystem and

954
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,960
as far as the surveillance of legacy

955
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,640
routers maybe clients will be more

956
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
willing to do it then i don't know so

957
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,680
i think it is something we should

958
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,760
consider making it something optional to

959
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,960
support just saying whether or not a

960
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,440
client

961
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,920
does support is a policy question that

962
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,359
is out of scope for us to answer for

963
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,000
them but

964
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,880
it's there as an option

965
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,520
thank you eric

966
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,640
and with this tommy has uh come to the

967
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,520
end of his

968
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,720
set if anybody wants some

969
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,400
final comments here i think we're gonna

970
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,079
move on to the next

971
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,800
and also actually in the uh interim here

972
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,160
thank you tommy

973
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,520
um oh daniel and ben do have a couple of

974
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,960
comments before we move on

975
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
um and one of the things also could you

976
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,000
mention

977
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,760
by the way um uh

978
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
just as we hope that this has been

979
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,680
effective um

980
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,839
rather than you know for this specific

981
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,599
issue of dealing with issues about you

982
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,160
know

983
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,240
focusing conversation on each issue as

984
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,359
we go um

985
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,280
but if you feel that this for some

986
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,640
reason has not been effective we'd like

987
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,440
to hear it so

988
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,640
thank you daniel so

989
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,160
i had a question regarding the the use

990
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,520
of a special

991
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,599
domain um since those domains um

992
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,040
are breaking dns sec or or

993
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,160
cannot be protected with dns um i'm

994
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,680
wondering if we could

995
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,240
i mean if we could use just a standard

996
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,560
name that is part of the dns

997
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,760
hierarchy and i was thinking of

998
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,880
using for example something a dns

999
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,200
a domain name that is built from the ip

1000
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,200
address so it could be the ip address

1001
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,760
dot

1002
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,240
opera um i just like

1003
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,680
we've we we

1004
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,839
we try to address that that aspect also

1005
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
so no this is

1006
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,760
sorry please go on tommy sure uh so this

1007
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,119
is an interesting proposal

1008
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,280
um let the other authors speak for

1009
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,240
themselves

1010
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,359
um my position on this is that the

1011
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,079
existing proposal is likely to have

1012
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,119
better adoption

1013
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,480
um given the rollout of dns sec compared

1014
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,960
to the reliance on pki

1015
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,280
um in a nutshell but certainly what

1016
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,200
you're proposing is possible

1017
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
it's something we should discuss uh we'd

1018
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,440
welcome an issue on github

1019
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,839
okay do you want me to raise the issue

1020
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,320
on github or

1021
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,400
okay yeah okay thank you daniel

1022
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,560
and i will note by the way that we are

1023
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,760
um about

1024
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,320
almost uh two-thirds into our session

1025
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,800
here

1026
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,320
so um uh if ben and eker could be quick

1027
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,839
in their comments

1028
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,520
okay uh on the reversal note i'll just

1029
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:23,839
say

1030
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,320
i think that tends to indicate it tends

1031
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,839
to be associated with

1032
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,680
as ownership of an ip address which

1033
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
isn't exactly the same thing as

1034
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,599
operational i have a box at this ip

1035
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,040
address

1036
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,640
so i think that i think that the

1037
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,880
semantic doesn't quite match

1038
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,760
uh on the the general forwarder question

1039
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,359
i'll just float to the working group

1040
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,000
that

1041
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,359
if we uh another alternative to consider

1042
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,560
is to try to split this into a separate

1043
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,440
draft

1044
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,320
say this draft scope is restricted to

1045
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,599
the same ip case

1046
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,200
and make sure that it doesn't put up any

1047
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
roadblocks and then add a second draft

1048
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,280
that talks about essentially forward or

1049
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,760
bypass

1050
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,200
great thank you ben and ecker has

1051
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,040
chosen to save his comments for later i

1052
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,119
suppose um so we are on to the next set

1053
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,920
all right so who uh is speaking to this

1054
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,640
uh draft

1055
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,839
yep yeah go ahead mohammed you can buzz

1056
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,839

this will be a i would say an update of

1062
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,720
the um the dnr draft to give the um

1063
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,440
i would say an update of the uh of the

1064
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,760
current status and the uh the opener

1065
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
issues we have you have so far so if you

1066
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
can move to the next slide please

1067
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,960
sure and mohammed let me make one

1068
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
comment if we don't get through all of

1069
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,680
your issues in this thing so don't rush

1070
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,440
we'll move them and carry on where we

1071
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
left off on the thursday session

1072
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,280
okay so don't rush yourself take the

1073
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,800
time you need

1074
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,599
okay fine yeah so in the in this slide

1075
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:11,920
we

1076
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,240
we are just i would say providing the um

1077
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,079
the pointer where we are we are tracking

1078
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:16,400
the

1079
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
the issues we have currently uh three

1080
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,440
open there

1081
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,520
uh two of them were or was during the uh

1082
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,319
uh the call for adoption so we are not

1083
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,079
we didn't reply to that

1084
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,839
to the i would say the discussion on the

1085
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,200
mailing list because we don't we didn't

1086
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,280
want it to uh to interfere with the

1087
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,119
call for adoption for itself and to

1088
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,839
bring more technical discussion on it

1089
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,839
but we didn't close that and we

1090
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,599
and this is stored on the i would say on

1091
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,280
the on the tracker itself

1092
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,440
uh in this presentation we will i would

1093
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,480
say we'll focus on

1094
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,480
one of the i would say on the issues

1095
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,560
that i would say

1096
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,040
triggered more discussion on the list um

1097
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
it was um i would say a comment from

1098
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,680
from from then

1099
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,119
it's basically to say that yeah we need

1100
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,200
to largely write the uh

1101
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,520
the document so that we we are moniz

1102
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,720
with the what the

1103
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,079
ddr is in our are doing so

1104
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,319
in the next slide we'll explain um in

1105
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,359
order to assess

1106
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,040
the i would say this issue we need first

1107
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,880
to understand what are the

1108
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,640
information what is the information that

1109
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,240
we are discovering in the um

1110
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,319
in the dinner specification

1111
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,720
uh so that to be sure if there is really

1112
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,440
something to be

1113
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,560
written or if that is true so um

1114
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
as you can see in these slides we it

1115
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,640
it's really the

1116
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,800
the information that we are discovering

1117
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,319
here are really minimal that means that

1118
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,760
we are not discovering a lot of

1119
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,560
information

1120
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,800
only the required information to

1121
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,760
establish a

1122
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,920
connection with with a server and that

1123
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,480
that that information is an

1124
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,200
authentication domain name and also a

1125
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,520
list

1126
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,400
of ip addresses um the list of ip

1127
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,599
addresses and the uh

1128
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,920
an alternate port number are really

1129
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,119
important because we

1130
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,160
um as we explained in the next slide

1131
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,960
uh we we need to avoid i would say uh

1132
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
probing

1133
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,640
and also we need to to avoid falling

1134
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,760
into um to

1135
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,280
the legacy dns um because otherwise we

1136
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
we will we will be

1137
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,119
inducing other security constraints into

1138
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,920
the um the

1139
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,400
the proposal and we want to uh to master

1140
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,760
and to control the information that you

1141
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,079
will

1142
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,240
convene directly using the dhcp and

1143
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,760
there are option

1144
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,200
um next thank you what no no uh

1145
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,800
ecker has a comment right on this please

1146
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,599
so i don't understand what like when we

1147
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,200
discussed adoption in this craft

1148
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,319
um i think there's pretty strong

1149
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,000
consensus that we should not attempt to

1150
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,599
reinvent the information model

1151
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,040
why aren't you just basically putting an

1152
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,720
svcp record

1153
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,400
i mean not unsure how do we encode in

1154
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,160
some different profession but like

1155
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,440
the same information is what you need so

1156
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,119
why aren't you simply why we can't why

1157
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,480
why don't we simply define a common

1158
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,839
piece of information and shove it in

1159
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,400
both places

1160
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,200
uh would you like to address that now

1161
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,839
muhammad

1162
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,280
can you just um repeat your your

1163
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,319
question eric please

1164
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,880
sure so it seems to me the information

1165
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,680
you need here

1166
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,880
is that more or less the same

1167
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,040
information is in ddr and so what you

1168
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,480
want to be doing is taking the same

1169
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
information model the svcb record all

1170
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,319
potentially re-encoded

1171
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,800
and shoved in and shove it in here

1172
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,640
yeah that that that's one option to do

1173
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,319
but for instance in if you

1174
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,760
if you refer to um to ddr the need for

1175
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,400
instance

1176
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,720
and name in order to i would say to uh

1177
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,000
to ignite all the

1178
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,880
the discovery process and here in the uh

1179
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,560
in the specification we are providing a

1180
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,640
means to provide this this name so

1181
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,240
that's why we have i would say an option

1182
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,000
to to convey to you and

1183
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,160
a name so that you can you can ignite

1184
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,040
your discovery

1185
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,839
process right so i'm saying that i'm

1186
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,400
saying

1187
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,560
i'm saying so i'm saying i'm saying the

1188
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,839
information in there correctly

1189
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,959
okay

1190
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,560
okay let's go give it to the previous

1191
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,839
slide please

1192
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,480
so like let's let's so

1193
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,160
so let's take a look at this at the

1194
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,319
right hand side where you have

1195
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,200
like some addresses and your port number

1196
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,560
and you have some flags

1197
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,480
like this is sort of vaguely like what

1198
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,920
svcb and ddr have but not exactly

1199
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,599
so like have exactly that

1200
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,200
have exactly the information that is in

1201
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,440
svcp for gdr

1202
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
including like with whether it's door

1203
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,640
dot including like

1204
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,720
including like the url pattern the whole

1205
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,400
thing

1206
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,079
yeah that that's true for the i would

1207
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,079
say for the uh the list of ip addresses

1208
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,520
and the for the pert number and this is

1209
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,960
what i'm what i was explaining in the

1210
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,040
i would say on the next slide in which

1211
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,079
we um in

1212
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,520
a previous uh version of this

1213
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,200
specification we had only the name the

1214
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,800
authentication address name and that

1215
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,319
authentication address name you can you

1216
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,359
can use

1217
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:03,680
directly i would say the svcp in order

1218
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,880
to return the last of

1219
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,960
your ip addresses and the internet port

1220
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,319
number that's something that there's

1221
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:08,720
more

1222
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,800
but there's more stuff in svcb in the

1223
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,800
ipedus and the port number

1224
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
yes i know and this is an issue that

1225
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,839
we'll discuss i would say

1226
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,000
in one of the of the slides here in the

1227
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,680
presentation

1228
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,599
here we are just explaining why we are

1229
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,200
just restricting ourselves to

1230
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,440
the minimum set of the information that

1231
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,560
needs to establish the

1232
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,960
the connection don't do that yeah

1233
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,240
i know but i'm disagreeing with that

1234
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,560
decision

1235
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,040
i'm saying like let us not try to

1236
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,200
reinvent this let us do exactly the same

1237
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,160
thing we did for ddr

1238
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,440
okay i think that's a very valuable

1239
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,960
feedback and should be raised as an

1240
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,440
issue

1241
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,200
for ending up for further investigation

1242
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,359
um but for the moment it seems like you

1243
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:54,800
two

1244
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:01,839
exchanged the idea so

1245
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,960
yes so so as i mentioned earlier so once

1246
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,800
you discover your name and you would say

1247
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,920
the um

1248
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,000
the list of api this is on the internet

1249
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,240
port number then you can use i would say

1250
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
what is defined in the um in dddr

1251
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,720
document in order to retrieve additional

1252
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,680
information from

1253
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,720
from from i would say from

1254
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:29,839
from from the server next slide please

1255
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,079
so the question we have once we have

1256
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,079
that in mind the it's what what's the

1257
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,760
decision information we need to uh i

1258
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,079
would say to convene the option

1259
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,480
and if do we really need to convey

1260
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,520
additional information

1261
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,920
so that we are more nice with the we dr

1262
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,480
ben schwartz please

1263
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,319
hi so uh my preference here

1264
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,640
would be to just uh just provide

1265
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,079
the name and let the client go through

1266
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,400
the ddr lookup process with the insecure

1267
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,920
revolver to get all the other

1268
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,680
information

1269
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,760
i recognize that this costs some small

1270
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,680
number of round trips but

1271
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,920
this is a this is only on network

1272
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,599
association it's not like

1273
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,599
a delay that you know there shouldn't be

1274
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,599
a long delay we're talking about

1275
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,359
round trips to the local resolver

1276
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,559
um so these these uh you know these

1277
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,240
round trips should be fast

1278
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,160
um and we're not talking about a delay

1279
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,400
that occurs on every page load or

1280
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,599
something it's only

1281
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,960
at the time when you're connected to the

1282
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,760
network it's also i think operationally

1283
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,440
preferable in many cases

1284
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,920
for example if i'm on a local network

1285
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,119
let's say i'm on a cp

1286
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,800
controlled network that actually hands

1287
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,400
out the isp's

1288
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,520
dns server in dhcp

1289
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,599
if the isp wants to make any alteration

1290
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,839
to the configuration of its dns server

1291
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,319
with ddr all it has to do is update its

1292
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:09,280
own records

1293
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,920
and that will naturally propagate if

1294
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,720
that information is all being hard coded

1295
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,960
into dhcp answers that are being handed

1296
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:19,440
out

1297
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,640
to users from customer devices then they

1298
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,359
have to

1299
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,760
actually get all of those customer

1300
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,720
devices

1301
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,880
configuration updated first before they

1302
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,880
can change their resolver configuration

1303
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,559
so it takes the details of resolver

1304
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,000
configuration puts it farther and

1305
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,040
farther away

1306
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,839
from where the resolver is keeping those

1307
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:38,319
together

1308
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,920
is has operational value i think

1309
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,800
if the latency is too much of a concern

1310
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,839
then i would

1311
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,559
maybe optionally for people who really

1312
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:51,040
care about this performance optimization

1313
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,119
say that what you do is you take the

1314
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,280
entire dns response that you would have

1315
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,319
gotten from ddr

1316
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,559
all the different rr types not just

1317
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,680
service b

1318
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,000
but whatever you know address records

1319
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,960
whatever it is

1320
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,000
that you would have gotten through the

1321
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,640
ddr process and you package it all up

1322
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,800
and you include it all inside the dhcp

1323
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,920
option

1324
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,000
this is you know to say this is okay

1325
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,480
this is everything you need to know

1326
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,920
and then we don't have to define new

1327
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,520
formats we don't have to worry about

1328
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,720
specs getting out of sync

1329
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,920
and and clients can be written to just

1330
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,760
take the the same inputs from two

1331
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,800
different sources

1332
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,319
thank you ben tommy jensen please

1333
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,640
so i'll point out that the uh

1334
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,119
the additional rtts are one concern

1335
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,760
another

1336
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,839
is security model so as discussed in the

1337
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,119
draft

1338
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,599
by putting all the information directly

1339
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,480
into

1340
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,440
dnr a client can avoid making plain text

1341
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,480
dns queries at

1342
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,920
all um and this is deemed as preferable

1343
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,520
for some networks

1344
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,290
as a trade-off because as you say

1345
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,960
[Music]

1346
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,760
using ddr means that the configuration

1347
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,200
can live closer to the resolver

1348
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,400
on the other hand using dnr allows the

1349
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,040
network

1350
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,640
to use protections for dhcp and ra

1351
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,640
as discussed in the draft that can

1352
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,079
protect against attacks on those

1353
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:16,880
technologies

1354
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,960
without necessarily needing to have

1355
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,800
something similar for dns

1356
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,599
um which is the case today those

1357
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,079
technologies exist for dhcpra

1358
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,480
um where and so we protect against

1359
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,000
attacks on the dns

1360
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,559
um is another reason why

1361
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,200
sorry i'm gonna just jump in and respond

1362
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,640
and say i don't

1363
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,559
um i i'm talking about the ddr section 5

1364
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,280
discovery

1365
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,400
using resolver names mechanism

1366
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,480
and that mechanism doesn't rely on any

1367
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,680
security properties

1368
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,119
of the insecure dna because the

1369
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,440
the resolver the ultimate resolver is

1370
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,720
authenticated

1371
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,839
back to the the original name that was

1372
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:00,640
provided then

1373
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,440
it's a named resolver so a dns

1374
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,839
can't do anything except deny you

1375
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,319
service which they could do anyway

1376
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,279
thank you your point

1377
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,680
thank you tommy and ben tommy polygliese

1378
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,720
all right yeah um so i totally agree

1379
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,280
with ben on this one i think

1380
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,119
having the name is sufficient

1381
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,920
to get a secure model of course someone

1382
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,720
can create a

1383
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,319
denial of service attack here and

1384
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,920
the essentially the worst case you're

1385
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,000
going to be in if you have

1386
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,119
ra guard or dhcp card is that the client

1387
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,240
would know that there is

1388
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,400
encrypted dns available and they would

1389
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,160
know that they are under attack

1390
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,800
um and then you can kind of handle that

1391
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,480
how you need to on the client but you

1392
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,280
would never have

1393
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,720
a silent type of attack here

1394
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,839
um so i think just having the name would

1395
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,520
be sufficient i also want to bring up

1396
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:04,720
that this um overall style of approach

1397
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,280
has been brought up

1398
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,480
for how you put information um about

1399
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,760
encrypted dns over

1400
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,440
vpns and things like ike and

1401
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,760
i was presented in the ipsec me group

1402
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,119
and largely that is

1403
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:20,720
following the pattern that's currently

1404
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,640
described here

1405
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,520
in dnr of sticking some of the

1406
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,960
information about the resolver not all

1407
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,760
of it

1408
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,640
directly in in this case ike properties

1409
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,119
um that's one area where we really want

1410
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:35,839
to see

1411
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,800
kind of alignment here of wherever that

1412
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,480
document goes forward

1413
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,040
um and again i think it'd be a lot

1414
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,800
cleaner to just have a name

1415
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,920
there and allow the rest of it to work

1416
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,640
and

1417
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,760
when we're doing this we need to think

1418
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,680
of the precedent we're setting um

1419
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,520
if we go with just a name that always

1420
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,599
points to a dns record that has all the

1421
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,040
details

1422
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,480
if we come up with a new dns

1423
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,480
encryption type so you know we already

1424
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,000
have dns over quick let's say we have

1425
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,119
dns over

1426
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,319
z and dns over z

1427
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,720
when that gets created and i want to

1428
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,240
start supporting that

1429
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,599
it would be nice if i only have to

1430
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,839
update my resolver and then it can serve

1431
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,880
a dns over z svcb record

1432
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,880
uh if we go the other way we're going to

1433
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,640
need to start

1434
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,839
uh updating these errors ra

1435
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,680
ike servers and propagate this

1436
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,119
information into a lot of different

1437
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,240
places and have

1438
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,640
a lot of revs anytime we want to create

1439
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,359
a new protocol

1440
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,839
thank you tommy ecker please

1441
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,720
uh ecker please

1442
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,880
things to say we just didn't hear them

1443
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,760
um i think tom's making a good point

1444
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,800
here i guess i would say

1445
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,319
like it seems to me that there are two

1446
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,440
coherent positions one is

1447
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,000
like just have a name and then do ddr

1448
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,880
basically

1449
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,800
and the other is stuff all the

1450
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,000
information of ddr

1451
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,200
i think what is problematic is the

1452
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,880
compromise position the second half this

1453
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,200
draft the second half of the slide above

1454
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,160
where it's like here's some of the

1455
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,280
information but not enough to actually

1456
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,200
do the job um that seems goofy

1457
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,200
so i think we should like i i have if it

1458
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,640
was just like i think it would probably

1459
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,440
be better just

1460
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,079
to to have uh sort of stop everything in

1461
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:22,960
form but like

1462
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,839
literally just the name

1463
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,920
thank you uh

1464
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,760
oh we lost muhammad

1465
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,280
for feedback but teary's here so tyro

1466
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,960
please

1467
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,799
hello everyone can you hear me yes yeah

1468
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,960
we started with just the name but then

1469
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,559
when we saw the svcb

1470
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,559
dns draft that ben had published which

1471
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,200
was being used by ddr was not mandating

1472
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,400
dns

1473
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,240
then we started looking into other ways

1474
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,760
because of the

1475
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,359
possible external attacks that could

1476
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,200
basically modify the

1477
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,440
dns response but if but if that draft

1478
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,079
gets updated to say dnsec is mandatory

1479
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,680
uh then probably that covers the

1480
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,119
scenario of uh

1481
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,720
any man in the middle device modifying

1482
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,359
the responses and all that this draft

1483
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,559
publishes either the adn or the

1484
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,640
or the entire stuff that the svcb is

1485
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,760
giving so

1486
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,760
idn is is much simpler that we could

1487
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,119
just stick to that and we don't have to

1488
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,079
worry about

1489
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,720
new protocols of dns coming up our new

1490
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,599
dns records

1491
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,000
uh record resource crash types coming in

1492
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,960
so that would

1493
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,440
uh i i think if that change happens

1494
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,240
probably then

1495
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,839
the security model keep the remains

1496
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:37,920
intact that uh even if the

1497
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,680
if there's a clear text dns query that

1498
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,119
goes outside the

1499
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,040
home network or enterprise network it's

1500
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,480
still being intact and

1501
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,079
the only damage that an attacker could

1502
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,680
do is drop the packet and not

1503
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,160
modify it

1504
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,960
okay uh thank you tyrion mohammed did

1505
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,440
you have

1506
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,680
something else you want to comment on

1507
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,599
the prior feedback you dropped for a

1508
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,359
moment there

1509
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,119
i i think i am hearing i would say the

1510
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,280
uh the uh the comment we are receiving

1511
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,400
and yeah this is actually that's

1512
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:07,599
something that we had in the past that

1513
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:08,319
we considered

1514
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,119
we started only i would say we with one

1515
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,079
option

1516
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,319
and then we completed as i would say as

1517
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,119
the working group

1518
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,280
is progressing on the um on the security

1519
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,280
assessment part we

1520
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,440
what the what we were hearing from the

1521
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,200
working group is that the um the work

1522
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,640
is as i would say is um is really a

1523
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,880
sensitivity to the attacks both the

1524
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,160
internal one and the

1525
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,480
i would say the external ones uh so that

1526
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,520
that's why we

1527
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,440
we have added i would say this um the

1528
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,520
the list of ip addresses to be directly

1529
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,079
communicated by the dhcp because we

1530
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,000
we thought that at least we solved the

1531
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,079
um the external attack and there is only

1532
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:44,880
the room for

1533
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,799
from from the international so yeah

1534
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,880
there is a trade-off there so

1535
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,880
and by the way in the in in this

1536
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,480
specification we don't we

1537
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,960
we don't have any i would say any um it

1538
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,119
is not monday to return without the the

1539
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,720
name and the ap address this is

1540
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,760
really something which is really

1541
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,000
deployment specific what we have so far

1542
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,040
in the document is

1543
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,200
it is recommended to to return i would

1544
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,559
say the name

1545
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:08,799
and then you can return directly the

1546
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,559
list of ip address but

1547
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,119
if there is no list of ip addresses that

1548
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,240
are returned by the

1549
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,040
i would say by the server to um to to

1550
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,319
the client because this is

1551
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,000
i would say a decision by a local

1552
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,400
deployment uh we have a discussion in

1553
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,079
one of the slides that you can you

1554
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,170
we if you can just please move to not do

1555
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,599
[Music]

1556
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,680
number eight please what um

1557
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,119
muhammad actually we're going to be um

1558
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:39,119
by the way wrapping up the slides here

1559
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:40,240
so this is going to be the last issue

1560
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,599
we're discussing before the end of the

1561
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,920
session

1562
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,880
okay that's that that's that's fine so

1563
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,160
this this is basically the

1564
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,240
the issue we are we are discussing we

1565
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,280
are struggling with that

1566
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,559
so if we the currency as i mentioned the

1567
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,079
current specification does not for b

1568
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,440
they would say a deployment tool to

1569
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,200
return only a domain name but then the

1570
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,160
question for us

1571
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,400
is what we will do with that that domain

1572
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,319
name should we just i would say

1573
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,319
use the the list of the legacy dns

1574
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,520
server and then the establish your

1575
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,640
authentication

1576
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,040
connection and go on or you just rely

1577
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,040
the i would say the name to to um

1578
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:16,319
using the svcb and then do the job so

1579
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,160
this i would say there's a lot of

1580
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,599
trade-offs there there are some i would

1581
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:20,960
say some parent codes

1582
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,000
um we so yeah we we would like to hear

1583
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,400
from

1584
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,319
from the working group which i would say

1585
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,240
what we what the working group want us

1586
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:28,799
to

1587
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,559
to have in the document but for that to

1588
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,160
happen we need more discussion and more

1589
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,319
inputs on that

1590
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:38,558
okay thank you mohammed dkg please

1591
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,640
uh thanks so sorry i

1592
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,720
uh i'm worried i'm a bit confused here

1593
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,960
but the distinction between

1594
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,599
just the name or full dns records

1595
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,160
stuffed in

1596
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,599
seems like there might be a distinction

1597
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,720
here if the dhcp server or the ra

1598
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,960
comes with multiple dns resolver ip

1599
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,319
addresses

1600
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,960
if you stick just the names in then you

1601
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,880
have a problem with linking the name

1602
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,359
to which ip addresses are in in use

1603
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:10,920
right like maybe i offer

1604
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,960
1.1.1.1 and 8.838 and i say the names

1605
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,960
are cloudflareddns.com and

1606
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,559
google you know dns.google

1607
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,440
but you don't necessarily tie them to

1608
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,640
the right ip addresses

1609
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,799
whereas if you stuff dns records you

1610
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,559
actually do get the linkage between the

1611
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:31,520
ip address

1612
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,720
and the domain names

1613
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,160
so just wanted to point out that linkage

1614
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,920
issue there

1615
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,960
for interpreter data

1616
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,960
thank you and last word for

1617
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,640
this set of slides right now will be ben

1618
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,359
schwartz please

1619
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,799
hi uh so i wanted to try to answer

1620
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,440
tyro's question about dns tech

1621
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,400
so if you look at ddr section 5 you'll

1622
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,359
see

1623
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,400
that it it

1624
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,799
specifies how to connect to a server

1625
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:05,920
using the ddr

1626
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,319
method when you start with an

1627
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,480
authentication name and the key thing

1628
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,680
is that regardless of of whether the dns

1629
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,079
records that you're using along the way

1630
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,240
were were valid or were in fact forged

1631
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,119
when you finally reach the server you do

1632
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,160
tls

1633
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,400
and you you do authenticated tls and

1634
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,160
authenticate it back to its name

1635
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,640
so it doesn't matter whether your dns

1636
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,839
was secure

1637
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,558
up to that point

1638
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,640
[Music]

1639
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,359
on the question of how to move ip

1640
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,960
addresses around which has been touched

1641
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,400
a couple of times

1642
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,200
the thing that makes sense to me is to

1643
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,119
say

1644
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,160
you you can just take a and quad a

1645
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,760
records and if you have a if each

1646
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,160
res named resolver is associated with a

1647
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:56,960
bag

1648
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,440
of records then you can put some a and

1649
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,119
quad a records in that bag

1650
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,520
now we know and we know the ip address

1651
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,240
and if you don't have those hints then

1652
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,920
you still don't have a linkage problem

1653
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:12,400
in my view because cloudflare.dns.com

1654
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
and all the others are global names they

1655
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,240
are resolvable so you can just do a

1656
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,920
and quad a queries for those names and

1657
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,799
get the ip address

1658
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,920
thank you and i see terry that you

1659
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,920
jumped in i'll note that we are

1660
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,920
officially over time right now so please

1661
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,920
make it very brief

1662
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,640
yeah hey hey ben uh uh i got your point

1663
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,359
uh

1664
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:36,079
there's no point that uh the tls

1665
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,000
certificate authentication will fail if

1666
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,920
an attacker modifies it but the bigger

1667
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,000
problem is uh for example if the client

1668
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,400
prefers to use let's say

1669
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,040
doq and it doesn't support others and if

1670
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,880
if the attacker strips the other

1671
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,400
to that protocol that the client

1672
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,480
supports then uh the client will never

1673
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,839
be able to pick that so

1674
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,680
there are threat vectors possible that

1675
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,760
if you don't use dnsec then

1676
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,319
uh the client would be forced because he

1677
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,760
realizes the server is supporting

1678
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,280
something

1679
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,079
like a new protocol and it has no

1680
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,599
support for it and it just gives up

1681
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,319
right

1682
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:11,440
so the the attack modifying the dns

1683
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,960
response need not be

1684
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,720
to point to a malicious server it could

1685
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,480
be just to show some properties of the

1686
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,280
server

1687
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,760
that the client beams it's incapable of

1688
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,200
connecting to and just gives up right

1689
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,880
thank you and muhammad we will continue

1690
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:27,359
