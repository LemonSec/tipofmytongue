00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
ip rules here

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,520
so this is what we have for an agenda

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,719
today it's

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,840
um actually two slides kind of busy

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,960
um let's take a few minutes and

18
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
see if we want to make any changes to

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
the agenda

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,320
um uh so we've got

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,680
uh nancy's gonna do a status update uh

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,040
for riv uh kathleen's gonna

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
talk about attestation sets and then

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,960
dave sailor we'll

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,159
we'll talk about rats architecture hank

26
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,079
that is that up with uh interaction

27
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,960
models

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
uh tuda

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,840
and then ada station results claims for

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,079
suit

31
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,320
and then jeremy's going to take us

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,119
through

33
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,560
seaboard tags from protected cwt claims

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,960
and then eric's going to take a few

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
minutes on yang

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,200
and add a station event stream

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
subscription

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
and then we have 10 minutes for use

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,360
cases and then essentially

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,520
and then 25 minutes for open mic so if

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
there's some other topics that we know

42
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,719
we want to talk about

43
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,759
we could throw those out now or

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,160
otherwise that that's gonna be our our

45
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,800
uh

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
overflow time for today giving this is

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,520
such a full

48
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
uh agenda and it looks like roman's in

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
the queue

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
r.a.d if we have time either today

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
or at the next session i see that we

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,879
have a few milestones that have

53
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,640
that are in the past so if we could use

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
that time to just clean that up and

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:32,879
figure out

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,720
what's the what's the realistic deadline

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,800
for them thanks

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,120
okay

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,100
okay anything else

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,319
[Applause]

61
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
if not then let's uh move on to

62
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
the first topic which is

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
the uh

64
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
status update so i guess nancy do you

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
want me to share

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
well i i don't have any slides uh it's

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
just more um

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
it's more a question and discussion um

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
and direction from roman our ad

70
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,239
so the rib draft has gone through

71
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,760
working group last call

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,159
i did the final review as i was writing

73
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,879
up the uh

74
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
the shepherd write-up and i noticed

75
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,200
there's quite a few drafts that are

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
being referenced

77
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,440
um like the architecture like the chara

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,879
draft

79
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,840
which makes sense it also references

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,360
interaction models

81
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
and tuda

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
interaction models we adopted

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
a couple of sessions ago but the tuda is

84
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
yet to be

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,400
a working group draft that said

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,120
the references to several drafts that

87
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,840
are still

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,799
under work or not adopted yet and so

89
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,799
roma and i didn't know whether you

90
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,120
wanted us to wait

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
until we got a little further with the

92
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,239
drafts

93
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,760
and packaged them together or

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,799
whether we can start going

95
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,000
through the isg publication

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,358
review um now knowing that

97
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,840
it's got some dependencies on on drafts

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
that are

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,400
not done yet right that that that's a

100
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
great great question i mean worst case

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,160
scenario if we push that document

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,240
uh document through you'd be sitting in

103
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,080
miss ref for a while on the back end

104
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,520
waiting for the other ones to catch up

105
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,479
process-wise

106
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
so let me take a look and i'll have an

107
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
answer tomorrow when we meet again

108
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
because the the concern might be and

109
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,720
i've i've had that concern myself on

110
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,479
other documents and i've seen the other

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
ads do as well where

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
if they see the reference to something

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
that looks very immature

114
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
and it's fairly crucial because it's a

115
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
normative reference to a key part of

116
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
that architecture

117
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
they might have the inclination to send

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,759
the document back because they said they

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,960
can't judge this one

120
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
without being able to read the other one

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,320
in details if the working group isn't

122
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,880
close

123
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
so it's a bit of a judgment call and let

124
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,639
me kind of poke at it a little bit

125
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,120
but based on all the links you you kind

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,000
of talked about

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,199
and especially since some of the

128
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
normative dependencies aren't even

129
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,400
adopted in the working group it might

130
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
seem like we want to wait a little

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,560
longer

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
not necessarily for the others to be

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,639
done but you know for it to be fleshed

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,759
out a little bit more in the working

135
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,280
group

136
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,440
okay i can forward you the list because

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
as i was doing the write up

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,320
um i had the list which i think i sent

139
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,919
you in an email but let me dig it up

140
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,479
again

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,080
and i'll send them for when i apologize

142
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,720
because i can see that email

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,520
yeah that's all right this is why we're

144
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,199
we're doing the update here

145
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,840
um so if you can let us know right

146
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,639
i'll know which way to take action yep

147
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,080
we'll do

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,159
that's it thanks in the queue

149
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
eric you're in nixon thank you yeah just

150
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,400
a one in piece of information for roman

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,479
is that nothing is normative it's just a

152
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,240
couple informational things so that

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,600
makes it hopefully a little easier

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
really does make it a lot easier i

155
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
apologize i did not look at

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
the references on those documents so let

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,960
me take a squint but if they're they're

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,759
informational

159
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
i think that's a different ballgame

160
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,160
thanks eric

161
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,479
okay um any other comments

162
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,440
if not let's move on to um

163
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,720
yeah attestation sets

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
kathleen

165
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
good morning okay so this is

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
um it's a pretty simple draft

167
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,440
and the reason for it is over the past

168
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,919
few years i've been really focused on

169
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,039
how do we scale security better

170
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,120
and you know just thinking about those

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,280
bigger problems that we have a 3.5

172
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,160
million person

173
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,080
deficit in security professionals

174
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,240
i don't think training is what's going

175
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
to get us through that deficit i think

176
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,919
we have to start thinking about

177
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,840
how we do things and doing them

178
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,880
differently so that we scale better

179
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,759
and so one of the small pieces of that

180
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,520
is when i've been reviewing the

181
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,639
architecture documents and

182
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,479
eat and documents and attestation even

183
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,479
outside of the ietf

184
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,639
i was i've been thinking about you know

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,000
how do we scale

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
better and i did a little work while i

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
was at dell so you'll see that there are

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,039
dell reviewers

189
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,240
um on this and so if this goes forward

190
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,319
i'll i'll likely add one of them

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,840
as a co-editor

192
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,520
so essentially you know we have

193
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
so anyone who's been in the sac working

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,039
group who has worked on

195
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,360
scap knows that there's a lot of

196
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,400
challenges still

197
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,240
for posture assessment there's a number

198
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,000
of organizations who are able to do it

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
but they typically are ones that have

200
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,319
good resources on site so smaller

201
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,240
organizations who don't have that level

202
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,680
of skill

203
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,280
just aren't able to deploy and have

204
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,039
their systems assessed on a regular

205
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,120
basis

206
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,919
um it's just too difficult or even

207
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,958
deploying a

208
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,200
an image to a standard could be

209
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
difficult

210
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,799
so the idea here is to shift that back

211
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,240
to the vendor

212
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,440
and to have

213
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,399
posture provided with attestation

214
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,120
locally

215
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
and then a summarization given back with

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
an eat

217
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
so some of the challenges with the

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,839
current models is that every

219
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,760
organization requires an expert

220
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,920
so how do we get rid of that demand for

221
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,279
an expert

222
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
at each location and it's shifting it

223
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,959
back because if we do

224
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,760
attestation and set that up at the

225
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
vendor which could be an application

226
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,279
provider it could be a container

227
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,600
it could be you know anything in the

228
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
stack the operating system

229
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
parts of the operating system you know

230
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
noting some of the challenges

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,160
michael had posted in response to

232
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
reading the draft

233
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,959
and for those who who didn't read that

234
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,920
message

235
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
essentially just you know if you have

236
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,880
one component relying on the validation

237
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,959
of a prior component

238
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,279
before attestation can happen the system

239
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,760
can hang or the application can hang

240
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
until that's corrected and so you know

241
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
there are obviously challenges still

242
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,160
using attestation um but having those

243
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,720
attestations set by the vendor with you

244
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,360
know measurement ranges that could work

245
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,560
um policy configurations to different

246
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,120
levels

247
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
is one way where we might be able to

248
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,519
get to a point where people could just

249
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,839
have an easy button and select i'm going

250
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,040
to implement

251
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
the cis benchmark for

252
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,760
kubernetes and let's say it's even at

253
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
different levels

254
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,160
because you have different requirements

255
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,560
you could just click that button

256
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,600
and have that attested

257
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,959
configuration and then over time you can

258
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,320
still do at runtime attestations to have

259
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,040
assurance

260
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,880
of that state being continued

261
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,519
and so the idea here is how can we push

262
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,480
this type of

263
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
you know built-in security model and

264
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,079
attestation

265
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,440
um being provided continuously to

266
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
businesses of any size regardless of

267
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,440
resources

268
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
next slide

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,800
now i was at dell for 13 years before i

270
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,519
made my

271
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,320
recent move so um my exposure was

272
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,399
you know in terms of implementations was

273
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,360
um you know

274
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,600
what happens with the the tpm and the

275
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
firmware and the boot cycles

276
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
um and so with that

277
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,920
they are systems are booted up and they

278
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,800
largely match to nist 800 or they match

279
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,760
to nist 800 193

280
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
and that's been further instantiated in

281
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,240
a tcg document for reference integrity

282
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
measurements

283
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
right so they are going against a set of

284
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,959
items as they go up the stack and it

285
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:35,920
happens

286
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,920
the verification happens at boot and

287
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,079
also at run time

288
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
they also happen locally if something

289
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,519
doesn't

290
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,279
quite match it can the system can wait

291
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
for that to match or restart a process

292
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
to ensure that the system's integrity is

293
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
as expected

294
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,880
and so if you consider that a set then

295
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
what if we just provided an attestation

296
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,440
over let's say the evidence

297
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,639
of that entire set completing um which

298
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,839
could be in this case

299
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,120
the um the tpm logs

300
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,440
um

301
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,200
and then that could be put into an eat

302
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,079
and you know i i don't know how we want

303
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,920
we would want to do that if it's just a

304
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,560
uri

305
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,680
to logs or the actual log file which

306
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,720
might be big

307
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,440
but then just that complete set would be

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,000
provided in a remote attestation

309
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
as opposed to each individual

310
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,720
attestation

311
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,920
because if you're thinking about

312
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,399
managing thousands of systems

313
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,639
how would you um pull in

314
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,200
all of the attestations for an entire

315
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,839
set

316
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
and then you know make them remote so

317
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,519
that just

318
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
in my mind doesn't scale and so the idea

319
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,560
of

320
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,639
doing this in a set seems to make more

321
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,800
sense and you could use whatever

322
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,000
you know just like the architecture

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
document says you could use whatever

324
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
interface you want to

325
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
transfer that set

326
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,079
attestation to the repository or

327
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,920
governance risk and compliance system

328
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,519
however you're going to do it next slide

329
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,839
please

330
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,839
so what does that look like um this

331
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,880
picture is

332
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,240
is from the the nist

333
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,959
800 193 document just because it

334
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,880
provides a nice overview of the full

335
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,720
um operating system and it's a bit

336
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,079
generic so it covers

337
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,120
you know like if this was using um

338
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,880
open titan or um you know something else

339
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,480
for the security board

340
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,160
um like uh like nitro for aws

341
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
or tpm

342
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,399
and goes up the stack and so you might

343
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,480
have different attestation sets

344
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,760
and so um you know so you might have the

345
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,199
riv one from the ccg and then you might

346
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,000
have one

347
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,399
on the operating system you might have

348
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,079
one on a container

349
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,279
and some of those may come from

350
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,880
different places right so that might be

351
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,440
against a cis benchmark

352
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,720
for the operating system or the

353
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,959
container or for the application

354
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,440
or could be against a disa stig or some

355
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,320
other nist

356
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
document and you'd want to be able to

357
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,160
note that in your attestation set

358
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,720
your attestation for the attestation set

359
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
before you

360
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,680
transfer that over to a grc system

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,560
next slide please

362
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,199
and so what this draft does is it

363
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,440
establishes that as a pattern

364
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,600
to get people to think about you know

365
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
how do we

366
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,680
do this at scale and how do we look at

367
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
remote attestation

368
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,120
and you know i'm just trying to

369
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,959
to do this before we get too far down

370
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,560
this path so people could start thinking

371
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,760
in this way and

372
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,920
and maybe even make an improvement upon

373
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,079
you know what i've suggested

374
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,120
and um with that you know i think we're

375
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
going to need to define

376
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
some claims and i you know i put

377
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,240
together an early table

378
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,199
just to suggest some ideas and i'm

379
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,880
hoping with collaboration we can build

380
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,639
that out and make this something very

381
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,760
useful

382
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,959
and make it so that we can get to that

383
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,120
easy button for customers

384
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,519
or for you know all organizations of all

385
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,320
sizes really

386
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,839
so that's that's it any questions

387
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,079
okay jessica's in the queue

388
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,680
hey can you hear me yes thank you okay

389
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,920
i had a question about um attesting to

390
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,440
configuration states and just in my

391
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
experience with s-cap i know

392
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
the amount of information they collect

393
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
is huge

394
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,839
and i'm not certain how that would work

395
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,360
in an attestation environment unless you

396
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,320
were thinking maybe of having a

397
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,639
uh like a on the box comparison to

398
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,360
policy

399
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
and then you you get you attest to

400
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,639
uh either yes you conform to the policy

401
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,320
or know you're not conforming to the

402
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,839
policy or were you envisioning something

403
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,079
different

404
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,279
um so i there has been some testing

405
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,360
of this and um it may just be a yes or

406
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,360
no but you know i i

407
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,040
i want to figure out how we can do this

408
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
at scale and

409
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,360
you know while s-cap serves a purpose

410
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,240
it's it's not

411
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
accessible to everyone so oh yeah this

412
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,240
is an effort to think about

413
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
how do we how do we go forward and um

414
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
improve things so if i got some details

415
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,160
wrong and something should be remote

416
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,720
um well i think you could work with that

417
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,920
right i think you could do

418
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,600
you could do that kind of attestation

419
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,279
and then if

420
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,360
if it turns out you're not conformant

421
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,959
right then maybe you do something else

422
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,559
like maybe there's a sweaty

423
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,679
um i don't think that's bad i kind of

424
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,039
like the idea

425
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
okay great thank you and um there might

426
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,119
be

427
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,359
you know some values where you can do

428
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
with attestation and some that you have

429
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
to do with other

430
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,640
other technologies but if we can get

431
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,919
further down the path

432
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,839
of doing more with attestation and

433
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,760
having it baked in

434
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
then you know like the identity

435
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,280
the software the firmware you know that

436
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,240
kind of thing

437
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,840
and then for configuration maybe there's

438
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,880
a multi-layer process sometimes if

439
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
okay yeah i like it perhaps but but with

440
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,039
a move towards how do we keep making

441
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,640
this simpler and easier for

442
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
those smaller organizations who are part

443
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
of your supply chain if you're a big

444
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,200
organization

445
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,840
or who just don't have resources even if

446
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,640
they're not part of your supply chain

447
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,520
awesome at dave

448
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,400
can you hear me okay yes so i just want

449
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,200
to reply to

450
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,559
jessica um i think there's at least

451
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,720
two different categories of policy

452
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,559
settings one type of setting

453
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,440
is uh things that might show up directly

454
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,840
in

455
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,320
claims an example of that would be in

456
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,039
eat

457
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,960
there's your debug posture and some

458
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,280
variate some types of debug posture

459
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,880
are configuration right they're not just

460
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,320
hardware settings otherwise hardware

461
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,039
settings right

462
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,440
so some might appear directly in claims

463
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,600
okay there's another category of things

464
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,080
that

465
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,840
if all of your configuration for a

466
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,520
particular category of stuff

467
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,559
is in a config file then you could do

468
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,160
something like just sending the hash of

469
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,919
the file and if for hash matches you

470
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,760
know that all those settings are at the

471
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,240
latest

472
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
version of that of those configuration

473
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,679
settings so you could say all my

474
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,559
configuration settings for category foo

475
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,640
is in one claim with a hash value in it

476
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,320
and that's sufficient and remediation is

477
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,360
just pushing out the new

478
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,559
uh policy file yeah my concern

479
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
if you've done if as long as you fit

480
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,840
your policy into these in these

481
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,720
categories so

482
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,200
yeah i think i think my issue would be

483
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,760
when you're

484
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,440
not conformant now how do you do that

485
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,039
sort of walk back

486
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,120
to know where you went wrong but i think

487
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,400
that's something we could tackle i

488
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
i just think it requires some thought

489
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,559
and i think this is on the path towards

490
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,280
getting that conversation going yeah at

491
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,120
the remediation level that's outside of

492
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
attestation right but if you just want

493
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,320
to be able to know that my point is if

494
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,000
you split it up into categories

495
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,160
one category has a hash and you can say

496
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,520
which hashes are good and which assets

497
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,360
are bad

498
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,559
and you don't need it on a percentage

499
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,799
basis might work right

500
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,360
now remediation later because it doesn't

501
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
as a network operator it doesn't do me

502
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,720
damn very good if i can't fix the

503
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,280
problem

504
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
right so just let's think about the

505
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,760
problem that way in a way of setting up

506
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
how we can address the issues that we

507
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,320
find

508
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
that's all yep that makes sense so i

509
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,799
think what we could start is by adding

510
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,280
in

511
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,240
a section you know that talks about this

512
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,960
that

513
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,440
you know using a hash to dave's point

514
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,159
and then leave this as an open question

515
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,159
to work through and figure out what

516
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,840
options do we have and how can we do

517
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,320
this in a way that scales

518
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,159
to justice point so thank you i

519
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,039
appreciate the feedback

520
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,240
guy

521
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,679
hi kathleen um i wondered

522
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
if you have looked at how this

523
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,159
idea intersects with um with some of the

524
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,280
material in

525
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,120
eric's trusted path routing document um

526
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,640
i know uh uh the title would imply that

527
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,240
eric's document is about

528
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,720
is about routing but uh it actually

529
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,280
includes

530
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,400
a proposal for the his so-called trust

531
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,679
vector you know a

532
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,960
a way to summarize attestation

533
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
to detail the attestation results and

534
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,240
turn it into

535
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,280
something that is

536
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,000
more easily consumed by all of the

537
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
different parties that might want to

538
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
know what the security state of the

539
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
device is and it sounds like that

540
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,919
might be a component in what you're

541
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
looking for here that is

542
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,400
perhaps so i i i didn't think of it for

543
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,760
the reasons that you're

544
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,640
you're stating and if it was device

545
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,440
focused i

546
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,360
i guess i was thinking about systems

547
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,120
yeah so i think the way i look at it is

548
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,559
um eric's eric's suggestion

549
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,000
is that you know uh not that this is

550
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,120
wired into

551
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,080
uh spec language but that the vendor is

552
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
likely to be able to do the best job of

553
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
a testing a particular vendor's device

554
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,280
but the result of that attestation

555
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,679
ultimately goes to could go to a lot of

556
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,120
different parties who are only

557
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,480
interested in

558
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
not what was the value of the pcr but

559
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
was that router okay

560
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,960
um so he's proposed summarizing

561
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
all of the thousands of bits that might

562
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,679
come out of an attestation result

563
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,440
into a short vector that says

564
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
you know hardware we've checked it out

565
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
it's okay the

566
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,200
firmware looks like it's okay and so on

567
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,559
and so forth

568
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,120
okay so i'll have to take a look it

569
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
might make sense to merge these ideas um

570
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,120
you know i i would have to see a title

571
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,679
change

572
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,440
too because um of all of the assumptions

573
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,840
we

574
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,919
made and then also your focus just on

575
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,200
devices

576
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,320
so people with um you know

577
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,120
who are doing client and server systems

578
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,600
wouldn't

579
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,080
necessarily go to a document focused on

580
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
devices and think it's appropriate for

581
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,039
them right so

582
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,480
i think that's what led me to believe it

583
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,799
would be a good idea to present this and

584
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,799
even if this doesn't go forward as a

585
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,679
draft i'd like the idea to go forward

586
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
um and then have you know have having

587
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,640
had the opportunity to present it to

588
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,799
just get this

589
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,080
thought put forward for client systems

590
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,039
and servers

591
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,240
and not just the device focus right

592
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,320
um and i think some of that is devices

593
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,919
are a little simpler so

594
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,640
we're seeing more work come forward with

595
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,799
attestation on devices and and looking

596
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,120
at

597
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,640
you know how do you secure the entire

598
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
device so i wanted to get something out

599
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,760
there for

600
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
client and server systems and how do we

601
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
go up the stack

602
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,640
okay that's good thank you

603
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,240
thank you eric yes uh

604
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,559
i'm very happy to see your draft i read

605
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,960
it and i had the same thought guy did

606
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,600
the trustworthiness vector does apply

607
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,120
also to systems the

608
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,000
goal is to have independent of routers

609
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,039
just a statement

610
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,679
of claims that could be made about

611
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,440
conclusions out of the attestation

612
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,480
results

613
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,760
and sort of summarize them happy to talk

614
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,559
with you

615
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,240
and others offline because we have been

616
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,159
thinking about turning them into eat

617
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,679
claims as well

618
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,120
so we can chat about that when you're

619
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
ready okay great

620
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,760
and then this would also consider levels

621
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,200
so you might

622
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
um if you look at let's say the cis

623
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
controls you might only attest to the

624
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,559
implementation group 1

625
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,159
where you get 85 risk reduction or you

626
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:24,960
might

627
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,679
um attest to implementation group 2

628
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,320
which

629
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,240
improves your risk reduction or

630
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,760
implementation group three if you're

631
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,880
looking for

632
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,039
you know a really secure system

633
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,919
yep the goal i hope is to ensure that we

634
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,039
have a set of

635
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,080
claims that can be defined per device

636
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,799
and then or per system and you'll know

637
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,520
what

638
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,760
types of claims are allowable for that

639
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,880
system type

640
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,799
and what the valid values would be for

641
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,159
that system type so you have

642
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,679
standardized claims

643
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,279
and then you'd be able to say for this

644
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,880
type of system this is the kind of

645
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,559
expected values that which might be

646
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,679
allowed

647
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,120
okay so we'll have to look at this and

648
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,880
also consider the differences between

649
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,520
devices and systems and figure out if

650
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,120
that means the same draft

651
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,880
or if it means you know with just

652
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
separate sections or if it's too complex

653
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,240
and and just because devices and systems

654
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,000
are so different you know does it mean

655
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,880
two drafts and and i'm open to whatever

656
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
works for me and we've also made the

657
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,640
trustworthiness levels and vectors

658
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,159
segmented knowing that this day would

659
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,799
come so it's been made to be pulled out

660
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,159
okay great all right so let's we need to

661
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,000
let's talk offline

662
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
yeah thank you everyone i appreciate

663
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,600
your feedback

664
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,960
thank you so uh

665
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,520
rats architecture is up next dave are

666
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,918
you there

667
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,400
all right um i do have an update on one

668
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,279
slide which will appear in the

669
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,559
proceedings but i'm just going to talk

670
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,440
to it verbally

671
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,039
uh when i get there which is feedback

672
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,880
from michael michael is actually i think

673
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,760
presenting in another

674
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
session right now so i'm presenting this

675
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,360
one um

676
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,320
this is a discussion on draft 10 of the

677
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,840
architecture document next slide

678
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,000
so uh we had working group last call

679
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
that was started after iota

680
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,120
ietf 109 and we had a bunch of reviews

681
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
from eric and guy

682
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,240
and thomas and probably some others i'm

683
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,039
forgetting uh and all of those comments

684
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
were addressed in 10.

685
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,279
uh kathleen moriarty did a document

686
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,880
shepard review just after the

687
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,720
document deadlines so kathleen's

688
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,400
comments are not gone

689
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,159
as fun 11 after um

690
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,039
this meeting uh we have a github repo if

691
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,080
you're new

692
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,559
and we've had roughly weekly design team

693
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,000
meetings although like

694
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
holidays off but i had roughly weekly

695
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,840
design team meetings never sent

696
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,679
f109 and we had a large number of github

697
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,360
issues and i'm happy to report that

698
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,080
we've had

699
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
71 github issues closed since the last

700
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,600
meeting

701
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,919
and so the only ones left is the one

702
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,720
that is

703
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
kathleen's new feedback and so we made

704
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,960
lots of great progress in the weekly

705
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,000
meetings since last iatf next slide

706
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,039
now here's a summary of uh of the things

707
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,080
that change there's

708
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,640
many editorial i'm not going to go

709
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,360
through but

710
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,080
uh those were non-technical changes but

711
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
significant number of editorial

712
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,440
improvements to clarify

713
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,159
what was meant along and and or things

714
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,919
better and so on

715
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,679
one structural change that you might

716
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,200
immediately notice if you try to do a

717
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,480
diff between

718
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,559
07 which is the draft as it appeared at

719
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,760
109 and

720
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,720
10 the current one is that the use cases

721
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
move before the terminology section

722
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,840
and this was in response to

723
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,399
some reviews that i think hank solicited

724
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,080
in terms of what was readable and

725
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,679
understandable by people that had not

726
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,600
been involved in the rat stuff

727
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,880
and so uh the use cases now try not to

728
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
use the terminology as much as possible

729
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
and just use layman's

730
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,960
speak and then the terminology comes in

731
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,760
after that

732
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
and covers you know the the rest of the

733
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
architecture using the terminology

734
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
so that was a structural change in

735
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
response to actually usability or

736
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,480
readability reviews um

737
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,919
one of the technical addition additions

738
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,159
had to do with more exposition of

739
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,760
reference values and reference value

740
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,880
providers right so back yet before

741
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,640
ietf109 we'd already introduced the

742
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,559
distinction between an endorser

743
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,720
and a reference value provider that

744
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,960
distinction may or may not exist in an

745
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,080
actual implementation

746
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
meaning those could be combined into one

747
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,559
implementation or could be two separate

748
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
implementations or even two separate

749
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,320
services you might subscribe to

750
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,559
um but there was a couple places that we

751
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,520
missed in terms of that separation

752
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,600
and so we fixed all those except for we

753
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,919
found one more after the draft deadline

754
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,240
and that's what's in an open request

755
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,279
right now

756
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,240
and so there's a little bit of

757
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
discussion on there if you were to look

758
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,960
in there between ned

759
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,840
and me and the summary is that um uh

760
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,039
this has to do in the layered

761
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,840
attestation

762
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,120
section where it it previously

763
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,159
incorrectly showed that you had a an

764
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,960
endorser for every layer in a layered

765
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240
attestation

766
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,559
and the pull request tries to fix that

767
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,279
to say okay only the hardware

768
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,320
needs an endorser but all the layers in

769
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,559
a layered attestation may need

770
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,559
reference values in order to appraise

771
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,320
them and so you may have a reference

772
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,679
value provider or at least a set of

773
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,799
reference values per

774
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,279
layer but really only an endorser for

775
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,640
anything that's hardware right so that's

776
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,760
the resolution

777
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,279
it's just not merged yet that would be

778
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,919
in draft 11.

779
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,840
and then the other thing that's actually

780
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,640
the majority of the diffs between

781
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,840
7 and 10 is the expanded freshness

782
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,840
section and the details of the

783
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
handles approach which started to appear

784
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,480
before 109

785
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,720
but a lot more information was added uh

786
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,919
between

787
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,840
between draft 07 and now so that's what

788
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,200
i want to spend some time on

789
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,000
on one slide so next slide and so this

790
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
is actually most of my presentation

791
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,520
here is this slide i think i've only got

792
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,840
maybe one more after this

793
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
so for freshness there's really three

794
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,960
styles of approach

795
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,399
and again rats does not constrain

796
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,559
which protocol that you're using or even

797
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,880
which style you're using for freshness

798
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,120
and so we say when you're going to use

799
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,559
something in the rat's architecture

800
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,840
you're going to have some protocol and

801
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,760
it's going to have some mechanism

802
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,880
all right and there's some you know

803
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,559
reference interaction models that we

804
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,279
have in other

805
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,760
documents and so on but the point is the

806
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,880
architecture covers

807
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,960
all three styles of approach not by

808
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
constraint just to say here's three

809
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,640
things that might be typical when you're

810
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,159
designing a solution

811
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,039
and all three of these are okay and they

812
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,720
have different trade-offs

813
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,000
so let's walk through what the

814
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,240
trade-offs are and the primary additions

815
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
are in that third category at the bottom

816
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,120
here under handles

817
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,960
but it's useful to compare against the

818
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,399
other two so let's walk through them

819
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,480
here as you can do that comparison

820
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,399
the first approach is to use

821
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,399
synchronized clocks and so freshness how

822
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,440
do you know

823
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,200
that something hasn't been replayed how

824
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,880
do you know that the evidence

825
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,120
is something that was generated fairly

826
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,080
recently

827
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,039
and not you know three weeks ago under a

828
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,960
different boot cycle or whatever

829
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
so where things have changed so how does

830
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,200
how does the the entity appraising

831
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,120
evidence or the entity appraising

832
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,519
attestation results no that evidence or

833
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,480
attestation

834
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,200
is results are fresh okay so the first

835
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
one is synchronized clocks

836
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,360
okay and so of course that means that

837
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,480
you'd have to have

838
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,640
clocks right where some iot devices may

839
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,039
not even have clocks if you're a sensor

840
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:39,919
mode

841
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,440
you have to have some means of

842
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,279
synchronizing them that secure

843
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,559
something like ntp set for example

844
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,480
could be other variations based on other

845
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,080
layers and things but that's one example

846
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,480
that

847
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,120
ietf folks might be familiar with you

848
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,159
have to have some time

849
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,600
source to synchronize to that you

850
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,360
actually trust so you have a dependency

851
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,760
on some other party

852
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,840
and then finally you need to have

853
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,519
typically additional claims

854
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,600
about your time sync in your evidence

855
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,039
like you need to be able to claim that

856
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:07,919
you actually

857
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,760
uh got them from a particular time

858
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,919
source that the relying party or the

859
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,919
receiver of that evidence that verifier

860
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:14,799
might trust

861
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,640
okay and so you might have to have

862
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,240
additional claims that are in there so

863
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,640
your

864
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360
set of claims gets slightly bigger okay

865
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,080
uh

866
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,240
then not having synchronized clocks

867
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,080
second category is to use nonces well

868
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,760
here a disadvantage is you need an extra

869
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,039
round trip to acquire the knowledge

870
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,640
because you can't generate the evidence

871
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,720
or you can't generate the

872
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,399
attestation results without having the

873
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,240
non-stick in it right so you need this

874
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,679
extra round trips there might be higher

875
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:38,399
latency

876
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,399
okay if you generate a knowledge you

877
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,080
actually have to store that nonce

878
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,320
so that when the evidence of the or the

879
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,399
attestation results arrives to see if it

880
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,760
has the not so you've got a state

881
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,519
requirement for every

882
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,240
uh attestation you have to generate a

883
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,080
nonce and store it for some period of

884
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,960
time that

885
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
might be significant in some in some use

886
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,080
cases

887
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
and so there's a the highest state

888
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,440
requirement is here and the highest

889
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,279
latency requirement is here

890
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,600
uh you also need some mechanism on the

891
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,720
nonce generator

892
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,799
such as a local clock but only on

893
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,399
whoever generates the nonce

894
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,080
to expire the nonsense how do you know

895
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,440
if that nonsense stale

896
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,279
right if you need to have to say that

897
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,720
that it's fresh within a particular

898
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,080
period of time you got to expire the

899
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,440
knots right

900
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,159
the person that uses the knots to sign

901
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,840
stuff and includes it in there doesn't

902
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,559
need a clock

903
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,159
but whoever generates the nonce needs a

904
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,840
way to expire them

905
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,120
and then finally uh if you in some cases

906
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,159
you might need the ability to

907
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,080
distinguish the age of a claim

908
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,440
value from the age of the claim in the

909
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,080
message

910
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,840
so for example uh if you had a

911
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,760
i don't know a gps location that was

912
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
acquired on boot and then you signed the

913
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,880
evidence you know

914
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,080
uh three days later right is that still

915
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,600
valid because there's a distinction

916
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,240
between

917
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,960
uh when the evidence was generated at

918
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,440
attestation time and when the gps or

919
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,159
when the

920
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,919
claim value was first measured and then

921
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,519
cached or something like that and so if

922
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,880
you need to know the difference then you

923
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,640
need to design some way to distinguish

924
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,279
that

925
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,880
because you can't just put a timestamp

926
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,320
in there and so we talk about

927
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,079
exact an example of how you might do

928
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,839
this in the uh

929
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,119
in the uh appendix

930
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,399
and then the third category is the one

931
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,159
that's really fleshed out contrast with

932
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,839
the other two there

933
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,079
handles like the first one we need some

934
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,159
third party to synchronize time source

935
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:24,879
to

936
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,480
here you need some third party to

937
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,079
distribute the handles

938
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,079
now i say third party but in theory the

939
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,000
third party could actually be

940
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
combined with one of their parties just

941
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,918
like your trusted time

942
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,599
source could in theory be combined into

943
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,040
the same device as one of the other ones

944
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,000
there too

945
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,599
so i say third party but it's really

946
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,119
talking about a third party in the sense

947
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,918
of how many roles are there right

948
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,599
to send them periodically so here the

949
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
handle distributor needs a clock because

950
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,359
it has to send them periodically

951
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,560
and so it has to know how to figure out

952
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
a period right but the receivers don't

953
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
have to have clocks

954
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
they don't have to have state like

955
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
nonces and stuff and so this one has a

956
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,960
lot of

957
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,400
nice properties compared to the other

958
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,839
two because the disadvantages aren't

959
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,960
there

960
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,640
um but and i'll talk about secure in

961
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,320
just a second uh because that's the the

962
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:08,640
one

963
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,760
uh elaboration point um and

964
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
uh but you also need to deal with some

965
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,119
mechanism to deal with the loss of the

966
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,040
hanger distributor availability right

967
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,920
because you don't have

968
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,440
if you don't have a local clock how do

969
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,280
you know that the handle distributor

970
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,200
is still reachable if you you just

971
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,560
haven't gotten something from them yet

972
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,520
how do you know whether they're still

973
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,119
there so you need to design some way to

974
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,240
do that

975
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,079
so let me say what the elaboration is it

976
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,040
would appear in the slides the

977
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,720
proceedings it's not on here so first

978
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,400
point michael wanted me to clarify what

979
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,599
we mean by a secure means of

980
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,720
distributing them

981
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,839
because we do spend some time in the

982
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,839
security considerations section talking

983
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:40,960
about this

984
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
um so integrity is obviously important

985
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,000
that the the

986
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,960
handle is the correct handle that the

987
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,680
origin

988
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,119
is authenticated so you know that they

989
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,359
came from the correct handle distributor

990
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,560
and because what happens here is the

991
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,480
handle distributor sends the same handle

992
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,839
to both entities

993
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,160
you know the sender and receiver of the

994
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,119
evidence the

995
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,480
sender of the evidence includes the

996
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,079
handle and they receive their evidence

997
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,520
checks it against the handle it got

998
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,320
right

999
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,880
so the handles work um so it can't be

1000
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
spoofed and

1001
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,320
uh the harder part is it can't be it

1002
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
can't be replayed okay

1003
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,880
so you might have to have a mechanism

1004
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,400
that distributes them that takes care of

1005
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,920
replay protection

1006
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,400
um but the one thing that you can't

1007
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,920
easily defend against

1008
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,680
unless you start adding additional

1009
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
things like local clocks and things is

1010
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
how do you deal with delay attacks and

1011
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,640
so

1012
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,079
let's say that you could somehow

1013
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,160
introduce a large delay between the

1014
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,440
handle distributor

1015
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,079
and the handle receivers then you could

1016
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,320
expand the freshness window

1017
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,480
uh you know the window of a set of how

1018
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,920
old can things be

1019
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,240
to to whatever value that you wanted and

1020
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,680
so you could do replay attacks within

1021
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,599
that if you could do delays of handles

1022
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,599
on both sides and so you'd have to have

1023
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,920
and design some way of dealing with that

1024
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
um that we don't say how you do that but

1025
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,200
you could potentially do it with local

1026
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
clocks i saw brendan jumped in queue and

1027
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,240
then jumped out i don't know if i just

1028
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,000
addressed his questions so

1029
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
uh go ahead brennan

1030
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,640
about to put it on the chat but i'll ask

1031
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,680
anyway um

1032
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,880
so our handles ps case because that

1033
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,079
that's the only way that this makes

1034
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,720
sense to me

1035
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,359
so i'm just curious as to how this works

1036
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,880
you can think of it as a psk

1037
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,680
yes i think um the term handle i think

1038
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,800
came from hank

1039
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,079
and so i don't know if hank wants to

1040
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,400
answer but uh it is a uh

1041
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,000
unpredictable uh value that is known to

1042
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,119
both parties

1043
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,359
and to most people that is synonymous

1044
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,839
with psk

1045
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,839
so

1046
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,839
yeah okay but maybe i can uh uh um

1047
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,240
answer a little bit of about tennis's uh

1048
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
question instead

1049
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
so uh he's asking relative time or

1050
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,040
absolute time

1051
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,160
um this depends um on the

1052
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,040
uh on the provider you typically want to

1053
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,240
have a tie

1054
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,119
into a global time if you do a relative

1055
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,200
time you create your own epochs

1056
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,520
starting by zero and have not a global

1057
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
time scale here

1058
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,800
in theory that is possible in a limited

1059
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,760
domain

1060
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,079
practically uh what we have encountered

1061
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,839
today in implementation is a tie

1062
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,920
ends with a global time scale but i

1063
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,000
could see something built on

1064
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,800
relative time only in a certain domain

1065
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,079
then you have to take care of

1066
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,520
synchronizing your whole domain

1067
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,440
and you will never have a help from a

1068
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,800
universal time scale like utc global

1069
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
yeah in general the only category that

1070
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,160
requires uh

1071
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,680
absolute time is typically the

1072
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,359
synchronized clocks one

1073
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,200
um unless you're trying to use it for

1074
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
you know logs or something like that

1075
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,000
then you might want synchronized clocks

1076
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,440
anyway

1077
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,800
all right thanks hank

1078
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,880
uh russ i guess you're in queue next

1079
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,920
hi um i have a real problem with the

1080
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,320
name handle

1081
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,119
there is the handle system from you know

1082
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,560
bobcon fame

1083
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,440
that the iatf really did not want to

1084
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
turn into a standard so there's an

1085
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,800
informational rc

1086
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,000
3650 i think um

1087
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,960
and uh you know dois and things like

1088
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,240
that are all based on it

1089
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,640
i think we can avoid the name collision

1090
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,079
um

1091
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,720
i and i think we should would you

1092
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,119
believe

1093
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,480
russ would you be okay if we used

1094
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,760
brendan's suggestion of calling them a

1095
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,839
piece okay

1096
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,560
absolutely those we know what are

1097
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,200
okay so it's a a psk generated by a

1098
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,800
third party and then distributed to two

1099
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,839
entities that are using

1100
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,760
using it yes and we also know that you

1101
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,960
have to distribute the

1102
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,480
manner that all the people in the middle

1103
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,800
can't see them as opposed to nonsense

1104
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,520
right

1105
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,800
yeah yep uh

1106
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
hank did you have a comment on that yeah

1107
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
just only quickly uh

1108
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,880
why i see names conflict with handles i

1109
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,839
also need

1110
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,520
inconsistency with a secret that is not

1111
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,200
secret so psk

1112
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,280
uh yeah well it is distributed as such

1113
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,800
but it is not secret necessarily so

1114
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,000
therefore intrinsically something

1115
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,480
different

1116
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,800
um potentially but we can do the name

1117
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,480
roulette offline

1118
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,920
so one of the questions that uh michael

1119
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,040
had asked and is

1120
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,000
are do you actually need confidentiality

1121
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,560
with

1122
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,079
handles okay and the document right now

1123
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,119
does not say that you need

1124
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,560
confidentiality

1125
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,640
i have not thought of any reason why you

1126
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,560
need confidentiality and i think one of

1127
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,680
hank's original

1128
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,760
use cases was the handles are actually

1129
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,880
broadcast

1130
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,800
to everybody right you can't predict

1131
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,920
them until the time

1132
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,599
until the epic comes so they're

1133
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,960
unpredictable

1134
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,599
but what once you're in that epic if

1135
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,800
they're public

1136
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
that's okay as far as we know so

1137
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,400
confidentiality is not needed and that's

1138
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
why probably the term secret

1139
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,560
is not is not required here all that's

1140
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,920
needed is that you can't predict it

1141
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,960
until the epic comes

1142
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,680
brendan did you have a follow-up

1143
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,720
so you're back in queue so this is a

1144
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,079
broadcast nonce

1145
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:10,319
with a limited time of validity is that

1146
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,599
the idea

1147
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,200
whether you broadcast it or whether you

1148
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,119
unicast it to two people is up to the

1149
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,680
protocol

1150
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,960
when you say distributing it could be

1151
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,640
any of those it could be broadcast it

1152
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,480
could be unicast to one entity or two

1153
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:20,960
entities

1154
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,319
one if if you happen to be one of the

1155
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,079
two entities yourself so right

1156
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,119
but but effectively it's a a changing

1157
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,160
random value yes yes correct

1158
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,760
okay it is like a nonce that is

1159
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,920
distributed a priori and can be reused

1160
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,760
across all the messages within that same

1161
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,200
epoch

1162
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
as opposed to not so it's a separate one

1163
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,720
per message

1164
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,880
then maybe what you actually mean is

1165
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,280
it's an epic id

1166
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,359
yes it's an unpredictable epic id

1167
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,839
correct

1168
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,640
and there might be some other opaque

1169
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,200
content

1170
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,440
in that that could handle for now uh

1171
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,760
that's more than an id

1172
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,400
yeah um but by the way this is the real

1173
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,680
content of the presentation it's this

1174
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,119
one slide so even if we don't get past

1175
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,800
this slide then we're okay so i see

1176
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,119
because

1177
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,880
i see michael has actually made it to

1178
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,480
this meeting so

1179
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,280
do you have a comment in this michael um

1180
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,079
yeah i'm just

1181
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,400
i'm not actually i'm just tied into like

1182
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,319
three or four meetings that's my problem

1183
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,920
um so um i i'm actually not even

1184
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,800
convinced that the uh epic id or

1185
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,920
whatever we're gonna call it

1186
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
i'm not actually convinced that we have

1187
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,040
a way of

1188
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,640
of the recipient validating the the

1189
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,319
integrity of it um so

1190
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,440
i i really

1191
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,400
imagining when i heard about handles as

1192
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,319
a distinct from nonces

1193
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,560
i was really imagining something like

1194
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,599
you know yeah

1195
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,480
a gps satellite you know tells everybody

1196
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,119
in the world

1197
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,560
it um and i can't see how we would

1198
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,880
validate that as being the legitimate

1199
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,839
gps

1200
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,359
satellite except that if you use the

1201
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,440
wrong one from the wrong guy

1202
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,880
uh i guess you have to retry

1203
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,560
um so one of the things that's in the

1204
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,160
draft right now michael

1205
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,680
is that you require origin

1206
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,920
authentication

1207
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,839
and so whatever your distribution

1208
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,280
mechanism whether it's broadcast or

1209
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,359
unicast right has to be signed by the

1210
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,280
handle distributor or the you know epic

1211
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,720
id distributor if you want to use that

1212
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,599
term right

1213
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,079
um so origin authentication is required

1214
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,319
and integrity is required and so

1215
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,400
if it's signed with his key for example

1216
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,160
and everybody else has the public key of

1217
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,599
that handle distributor then you have

1218
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,880
integrity and anti-spoofing

1219
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
okay i mean i i think i understood that

1220
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,079
at some point and

1221
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,119
and um i i guess i'm looking forward to

1222
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,000
an implementation

1223
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,800
draft of some kind to explain how we do

1224
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,280
this

1225
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,160
and um i think there's there's there's

1226
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,280
major

1227
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,040
um how do devices uh

1228
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,640
get this kind of thing given that they

1229
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,640
may not yet be on a network where they

1230
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,480
can actually download uh

1231
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,800
i guess a public key it's got to be to

1232
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,160
validate this

1233
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,880
um although i could imagine some uh

1234
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,640
symmetric key mechanism like

1235
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,079
s key or um i guess the other word is uh

1236
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,680
it's a not merkle tree but there's

1237
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,240
another variation of that where you

1238
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,800
like hash based signatures i think uh

1239
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,599
but

1240
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,520
anyway regardless of that you got to

1241
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,079
know how to how to validate it and

1242
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,680
um so i can imagine you know round trips

1243
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,880
with between the tester and the verifier

1244
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,920
where the verifier

1245
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,640
actually just has to somehow get data to

1246
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,079
validate it at which point you might as

1247
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:34,400
well

1248
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,000
use the not um yeah so the point is

1249
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,680
the point of putting this uh that all

1250
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,520
three in the document and i know

1251
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,720
michael's been in these meetings but

1252
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,560
this is partly uh kind of a panel

1253
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,920
between the editors here between

1254
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,520
michael and me and hank that are talking

1255
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,440
to just share our thoughts to everybody

1256
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,079
else here

1257
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,680
um that part of the architecture

1258
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,599
documents point is to share that there

1259
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,319
are these three

1260
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,760
styles of approach when you're designing

1261
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,520
a solution you got to pick one

1262
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,760
or more but typically one and flesh it

1263
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,200
out and say how it works

1264
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,240
um but if you're going to design

1265
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,480
something to work with attestation

1266
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,920
then you should be aware that there's

1267
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,359
these different styles of approach and

1268
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,640
different solutions

1269
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,359
that you might have to be uh sort of

1270
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:12,880
agnostic as to which one of these are

1271
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,319
because there's different tradeoffs here

1272
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,440
right you're trying to optimize for

1273
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,960
state or latency

1274
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,359
or minimize dependencies or whatever you

1275
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:20,720
pick a different approach here in any

1276
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,160
particular solution this is just the

1277
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,760
architecture not the solution document

1278
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,400
so yeah

1279
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,480
everything you said michael is right and

1280
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,000
uh dave i'll i'll just add for the rest

1281
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,560
of the group so in the six dish space

1282
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,240
we actually have a beacon extendable

1283
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,760
beacon that actually would handle this

1284
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:34,079
thing

1285
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,480
very well and even has pretty all the

1286
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,599
properties that

1287
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,359
you can use it and you can use it

1288
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,359
without knowing how to authenticate it

1289
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,480
because you authenticate it later

1290
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,079
afterwards when you succeeded that you

1291
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,920
actually succeeded with the correct

1292
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,160
uh thing but you kind of have to do a

1293
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,240
little bit of a leap of faith initially

1294
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,319
to get there but then you validate

1295
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,480
afterwards so i don't think it's crazy

1296
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,280
um

1297
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,040
russ i guess i'll find another word for

1298
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,720
this um i think

1299
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,480
i'm happy with that too okay

1300
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,599
i put in chat a pointer to s key

1301
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,040
cool one thing on the handle um

1302
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,560
it does have some different properties

1303
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,319
than nonces if you're with routers and

1304
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,839
you have thousands of

1305
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,319
people trying to connect the handle

1306
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,000
scales a lot better with the hardware

1307
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,640
and then

1308
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,800
i wouldn't say that they're equivalent

1309
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,880
in terms of scalability

1310
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,960
yeah that's my whole point that nonsense

1311
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,040
have a huge stake requirement

1312
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,920
handles uh you might only be storing one

1313
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:32,240
or

1314
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,560
typically two potentially three but

1315
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,400
normally you'd be storing two handles

1316
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:36,960
total

1317
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,960
not doesn't independent of the number of

1318
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,319
people that you talk to

1319
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,720
and so handle skill far better in state

1320
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,560
right nonsense the disadvantage of state

1321
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,839
and latency

1322
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,680
uh synchronized clocks and handles at

1323
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,400
disadvantages relying on the third party

1324
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,160
and synchronized clocks disadvantages

1325
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,359
you got to have clocks and all the

1326
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,480
entities

1327
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,240
all right uh that looks like a hint from

1328
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,760
ned that he wants me to move on so

1329
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
brandon i guess you get the last comment

1330
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,240
here

1331
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,560
but uh well

1332
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,640
so i was letting it go because this is a

1333
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,680
good discussion

1334
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,800
um so yeah

1335
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,720
yeah you see this last slide is i'm only

1336
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,319
gonna spend 30 seconds on the last slide

1337
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,680
so

1338
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,160
good yeah i was gonna say given that we

1339
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,480
you know have 25 minutes of the open mic

1340
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,760
i was letting it run

1341
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,800
oh okay all right cool thank you i was

1342
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,079
just gonna give you a couple more

1343
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,280
minutes uh

1344
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,359
all right because let me there are more

1345
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,359
presentations yeah go ahead let me spend

1346
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,960
my 30 seconds right now

1347
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,599
and then we can just use any queue time

1348
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,400
for it for

1349
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,960
uh for until you want to cut us off so

1350
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,520
uh the 30 seconds on this one was

1351
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,319
um all of our normative references are

1352
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,839
to rfcs hey

1353
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,599
roman nothing is depending on

1354
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,040
informative references we added a bunch

1355
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,559
of informative references the one of

1356
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:51,440
note

1357
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,200
is that the confidential computing

1358
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,720
consortium has

1359
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,440
a deep dive white paper that uh

1360
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,160
references

1361
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,599
our architecture document and our

1362
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,440
architecture document references the

1363
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,040
deep dive white paper in the use cases

1364
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
section so it's nice that we have parity

1365
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,400
or you know symmetry between the two

1366
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,000
documents that the two organizations are

1367
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,800
in sync

1368
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,400
um yes i had something to do with that

1369
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,960
full disclosure i chair the technical

1370
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,839
advisory council and people like thomas

1371
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,599
wassati and eric voight who've also been

1372
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,200
part of all the weekly design meetings

1373
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,040
are also part of

1374
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,760
the ccc discussions so that's my 30

1375
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,240
seconds

1376
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,359
all right now we can go back to the

1377
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,880
previous slide if brennan has other

1378
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,440
comments so

1379
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,839
yeah so i'm trying to understand the use

1380
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,960
cases for handles

1381
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,599
um now in particular i know you've just

1382
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,240
gone through

1383
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,800
the trade-offs but i i want to just sort

1384
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,440
of

1385
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,559
take a step back for a moment um

1386
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,040
synchronized clocks versus handles i

1387
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,640
think are probably the most relevant

1388
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,359
thing

1389
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,920
um because your handles as near as i can

1390
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,160
tell are a synchronized clock

1391
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,119
it's just a question of how synchronized

1392
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,599
and how precise your synchronization is

1393
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,760
if you're distributing handles the

1394
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,599
handles don't give you any notion of

1395
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,880
absolute time so

1396
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,240
it's not like you get a time that you

1397
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,920
can put into a log that's trusted you

1398
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,240
get

1399
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,119
no no but it's a proof of freshness it's

1400
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,240
also a

1401
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,079
handles are also less precise than

1402
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:17,839
synchronized clocks so with synchronized

1403
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,119
clocks you can say

1404
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,880
i have a reason to believe that the

1405
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
evidence is exactly

1406
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,000
um you know five minutes old plus or

1407
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,119
minus the uh

1408
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,520
drift in the synchronized clocks right

1409
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,599
as opposed to handles if your epic

1410
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,680
is you know every 15 minutes i just know

1411
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,960
that it's within my 15 minute

1412
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,200
interval but i don't know when right no

1413
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,520
no that's exactly what i'm trying to say

1414
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,079
yes

1415
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,640
so the point i'm making is that handles

1416
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,480
are synchronized clocks

1417
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,880
the question is whether they provide you

1418
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,079
anything more than

1419
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,119
yes no or do they give you ordering so

1420
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,880
they don't give you ordering

1421
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,520
the question is why you're not use

1422
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,200
property ordering they only give you a

1423
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,800
very weak property of ordering so i said

1424
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,400
that you'd store like two handles right

1425
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,920
and this is the example that's done

1426
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,839
that's used in the refreshed section

1427
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,440
right so so you might know that they're

1428
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,040
using the previous handle of the current

1429
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,520
handle

1430
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,559
in the middle of a change so so the

1431
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,079
point i'm trying to get to here

1432
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,960
is that if it it if it de facto is a

1433
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,200
weakly synchronized clock

1434
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,480
which is what it looks like to me

1435
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,480
why not just use a weekly synchronized

1436
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,240
clock why go through the extra hassle

1437
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,800
why make it harder than it needs to be

1438
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,079
because what you've done is have a local

1439
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:30,880
clock

1440
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,720
you always have a local flight

1441
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,319
dependency that does not exist in the

1442
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,440
handles

1443
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,160
everything has clocks show me a

1444
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,119
microcontroller without a clock

1445
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,720
notwithstanding those weird clockless

1446
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,480
ones that no one uses uh

1447
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,319
i will show you multiple very large

1448
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,160
devices that don't have trusted clocks

1449
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,040
in the tpu

1450
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,440
trusted clocks are a different thing

1451
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,760
okay

1452
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,880
if you're trying to use them for a test

1453
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,960
station and you're trying to test

1454
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,319
for a the level of a tee you need a

1455
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,000
tr no this is only one of the use cases

1456
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,599
right the teu use case right but for

1457
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,880
that use case you'd have to

1458
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,359
appreciate a local block but the point

1459
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,400
i'm trying to make

1460
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,359
is is that the handles that you're using

1461
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:11,920
have

1462
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,079
all the same requirements as a

1463
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,280
synchronized clock

1464
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,200
the only thing they don't have is an

1465
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,240
expiry time

1466
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,959
if you were

1467
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,520
guys we need to move on because now we

1468
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,880
we are getting

1469
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,559
close to uh not completing our agenda

1470
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,000
thank you brandon let's continue this

1471
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,319
discussion um and uh i'm sure

1472
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,920
hank has views because the handle stuff

1473
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,200
came from hank so i want to make sure

1474
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,040
hank is involved in these discussions so

1475
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,839
all right thanks nancy

1476
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,559
thanks guys okay hank i think you're up

1477
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,880
next

1478
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,760
sorry ned i'm just trying to keep time

1479
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,200
for the clock i think it was a good

1480
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,040
discussion on the architecture but

1481
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,280
we we now need to move forward with the

1482
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,160
rest of the agenda

1483
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,118
okay does this work

1484
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,319
oh my god yes we hear you

1485
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,759
render my hair gray in this light

1486
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,920
um so hi there's the thing um i'm going

1487
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,000
to present about three

1488
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,559
ids we have here in reds uh every

1489
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,920
presentation will be a

1490
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
single content slide so expect this to

1491
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,280
be a

1492
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,720
discussion or a time saver mostly um

1493
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,680
so uh first slide is about the reference

1494
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,720
interaction models

1495
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,280
id that was adopted by the working group

1496
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,079
last

1497
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,079
after last meeting next slide please

1498
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,000
i won't have to somehow remove most

1499
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,079
too many messages they clutter the desk

1500
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,119
at some point um

1501
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,599
so yeah there's an update here with

1502
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,319
respect to

1503
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,319
um i can i can use the next slide thank

1504
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,480
you

1505
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,200
um

1506
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,720
running cold yes i'm lagging here

1507
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,640
i need my slides actually oh and there's

1508
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,839
a typhoon email address

1509
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,079
could you please um thank you um uh

1510
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,079
what i was about to say was oh yeah uh

1511
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,440
there is a new uh

1512
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,359
implementation here uh available on

1513
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,720
github

1514
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,200
version i don't speak french very well

1515
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,920
so i guess

1516
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,480
that's similar to a verizon that's the

1517
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,680
color of grapes

1518
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,880
during the ripening from green to red so

1519
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,280
it's

1520
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,319
it's go implementations and other items

1521
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:49,200
there on that

1522
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,359
repository it's an organization actually

1523
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:53,280
with multiple repositories and one

1524
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,280
hackathon demo which provides containers

1525
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,280
and we have to think i think thomas is

1526
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,960
here in yorkish for example

1527
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,000
arm employees who are doing this so

1528
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,960
thank you a lot

1529
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,599
uh for for hacking at this uh this

1530
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,040
complements basically the

1531
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,040
both are using the challenge response

1532
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,640
interaction model from this

1533
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,760
document here and

1534
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,079
also again there was feedback coming

1535
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,440
from preliminary

1536
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,559
implementation uh from that

1537
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,920
domain so to speak and we got a few uh

1538
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,040
good uh um results here there were no

1539
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,800
conceptual issues with the draft it was

1540
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,359
actually

1541
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,440
helpful during implementation as the

1542
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,040
middle piece of the abstract thing

1543
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,480
that's the architecture

1544
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,000
and um well the uh um the implementation

1545
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,240
itself so so it's a good middle ground

1546
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,960
uh as we intended it to be uh there are

1547
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,599
now

1548
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,440
20 as a working group item there are now

1549
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,880
20 open

1550
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,839
github issues uh thanks for way for them

1551
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,960
this is a barrage of super useful points

1552
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,960
to talk about uh some of them actually

1553
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,319
not easy to uh

1554
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,960
reply uh ad hoc so please have a look at

1555
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,760
this uh

1556
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,119
and uh this oil tends to uh somehow

1557
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,480
prepare for working group

1558
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,440
call of course um so as the conceptual

1559
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,160
parts are

1560
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,200
relatively uh stable i think

1561
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,599
from what feedback we already got um

1562
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,319
these are

1563
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,960
mostly editorial or if it's just

1564
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,079
confusing content

1565
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,480
and the question is does that belong to

1566
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,440
this document

1567
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,520
so uh please have a check for the issues

1568
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,200
and reviews of the whole document are of

1569
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,240
course welcome

1570
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,559
i know that uh there had to be some

1571
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,559
privatization here before itf

1572
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,599
and other ids one here in this group so

1573
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,920
maybe in the next round there will be

1574
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,680
room for this id

1575
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,319
and yeah that's basically my report if

1576
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,839
there are any questions about this

1577
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,880
i will wait a few secs

1578
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,359
otherwise we can move on to the next

1579
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,920
presentation

1580
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,400
which is toda so uh you heard uh you

1581
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,119
probably

1582
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:59,200
in the past uh meetings and sessions and

1583
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,880
interests you've heard

1584
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,920
two dimensions as a reference tuda is

1585
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,160
an implementation as a specification of

1586
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,680
story and an implementation

1587
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,520
uh with respect to the uh unidirectional

1588
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,680
remote attestation as depicted as one of

1589
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,440
the interaction models and the previous

1590
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,559
id next slide please

1591
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,359
and the latest updates to this id

1592
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:30,559
includes alignment with the maturing

1593
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:31,680
documents here

1594
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,160
in this working group uh primarily the

1595
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,200
architecture

1596
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,440
riv and of course the interaction model

1597
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,440
it's now all aligned all terminology was

1598
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,280
thrown out actually there was some

1599
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,280
really really old terminology in the

1600
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,920
let's say last third of the id that was

1601
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,280
not touched

1602
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,400
recently there are two major open

1603
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,119
questions we provide

1604
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,520
a exemplary interface reference

1605
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,480
interface

1606
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,599
for a tpm 1.2 um

1607
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,760
that's an old thing but it's deployed in

1608
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,160
millions of devices today still

1609
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,480
um so we are considering maybe opening

1610
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,559
up the questions do we want to keep that

1611
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,400
uh personally i'm leaning a little bit

1612
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,079
towards yeah because people

1613
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,280
need it but that would be a interesting

1614
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,200
question to be answered as a working

1615
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,559
group item

1616
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,880
then again we have two types of

1617
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,640
reference interfaces here

1618
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,119
one of them snmp thanks to iron

1619
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,000
macdonald and

1620
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,200
a yang module also yang is the

1621
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,920
more cool kid on the block here in the

1622
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,040
iitf

1623
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,799
so second question would be uh do we

1624
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,079
need snmp again

1625
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,960
personally i have a slight preference

1626
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,680
towards

1627
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,240
including both but this could also be

1628
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:42,960
another

1629
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,319
item for working group discussion so

1630
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,960
as the content seems rather complete and

1631
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,799
it just has to be pruned more

1632
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,000
and put into shape for an isd process

1633
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,079
here i would like to ask or formally

1634
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,000
request basically the chairs

1635
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
um to do a working group adoption call

1636
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,920
maybe if that's even uh

1637
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,359
i think the item is okay and uh and then

1638
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,119
we can go from there maybe as a working

1639
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,599
group adopted item now

1640
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,040
so that's this slide here any questions

1641
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,920
or feedback on that

1642
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,920
and maybe directly to the chairs do you

1643
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,440
see a

1644
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,200
an obstacle here or do you want to take

1645
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
this offline to the list the vga

1646
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,359
question w question sorry

1647
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,160
well i suppose we can run a quick poll

1648
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,880
um

1649
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,040
to see how many people have read the

1650
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,720
draft

1651
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,760
um so let me put on the poll

1652
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,640
have you read this draft

1653
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,799
okay

1654
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:54,720
okay let me run this for a minute

1655
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,839
uh there's a poll

1656
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,240
running can you update the wording to

1657
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,760
say have you read

1658
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,839
this version or have you read any

1659
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,799
version whichever way you prefer

1660
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,400
uh i don't know if i can edit the poll

1661
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,359
now

1662
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,520
i can start a new one what version is

1663
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:15,839
the

1664
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,839
the latest version

1665
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,920
the latest version

1666
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,799
of the tudor draft

1667
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,240
is that better dave

1668
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:47,839
i should maybe also look at that

1669
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:15,839
okay i'm gonna give it 10 more seconds

1670
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,839
okay so

1671
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,640
i see four people have raised their

1672
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,160
hands

1673
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,839
17 did not

1674
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:40,559
read the draft explicitly said they they

1675
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,160
didn't raise their hands

1676
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,359
um i guess

1677
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,839
of the four people who raised their

1678
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,920
hands

1679
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,440
i should have clarified the question um

1680
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,119
of the four people since there were only

1681
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,640
four that raised their hands i'm

1682
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,000
presuming the four

1683
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,319
were not one of the authors

1684
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,599
no i wasn't watching it it doesn't make

1685
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,440
sense to um

1686
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,400
um well that's why sometimes people will

1687
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,040
vote anyway

1688
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,400
and and as hannah's is noting there are

1689
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,839
four authors i want to make sure it

1690
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,839
wasn't the four authors

1691
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,799
okay i'd like to get a couple more

1692
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:29,359
people

1693
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:33,359
to read the draft um what we can do

1694
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:39,839
is take it on the list and see if um

1695
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:46,160
let's see what honestly said um

1696
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,599
so let let's take it up to the list and

1697
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,880
see if we can get a couple more um

1698
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,119
people and get discussions going so that

1699
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,400
we can uh

1700
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,119
make the call for adoption if there's

1701
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,319
enough

1702
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:01,920
this one and i can at least tell

1703
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,680
hundreds that two at least two of the

1704
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,520
authors aren't here so even if both

1705
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,720
authors voted then there are two other

1706
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,200
people

1707
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,160
at the very minimum

1708
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:16,160
all right okay so given that let's move

1709
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,399
on to the next one thanks joe

1710
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,240
so this might be uh the uh item that

1711
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,359
is this might be the item that is a

1712
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:29,920
little bit

1713
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,599
um uh more to the discussion point here

1714
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,640
for today

1715
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,799
um hastily prepared this uh

1716
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,400
the slide deck uh it is about the um

1717
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,839
claim sets that we fleshed out based on

1718
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,200
the working

1719
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,760
items in the suit working group which

1720
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,119
are the manifest

1721
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:53,039
and corresponding architecture and

1722
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,440
information model

1723
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,160
next slide please

1724
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,480
so uh the the fundamental idea here is

1725
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,280
that uh

1726
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,039
software updates to the internet things

1727
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,839
are vital to the trustworthiness of uh

1728
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,640
things and uh might be services uh might

1729
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,920
be devices

1730
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,119
and uh all the things and so uh um

1731
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,480
there are uh now uh this idea includes i

1732
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:21,359
think a very

1733
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,799
uh a proficient set of claims derived

1734
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:25,200
from

1735
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,119
these uh booting devices with new or old

1736
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,160
firmware components and then reporting

1737
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,119
also about the

1738
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,839
update procedures during runtime before

1739
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:36,960
a

1740
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,720
reboot and a boot of a new firm was

1741
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,400
conducted

1742
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,559
there were some inconsistencies here on

1743
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,160
the zero zero as it sometimes happens

1744
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,520
these are fixed now

1745
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,119
uh brandon and i are relatively

1746
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,960
confident that the naming and

1747
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,280
the descriptions of all claims are uh

1748
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,039
quite okay right now

1749
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,319
um that said um the uh

1750
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,359
some of the items uh described here

1751
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,920
in the claims set for attestation

1752
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,079
results and evidence for reds

1753
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,480
will become a new id in the suits

1754
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,280
working group

1755
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,760
because uh the actual manifest that

1756
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,000
steers and executes the update

1757
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,480
and the resulting report will be

1758
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,520
separated

1759
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,000
the reports will become a new standalone

1760
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,640
id

1761
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,039
just as an fyi so not all of this will

1762
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,000
be uh

1763
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,240
in the items that are recently and will

1764
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,079
at the moment be moved to the

1765
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,319
isg we also have

1766
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:32,000
realized and came to the understanding

1767
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,920
the course of the last half year

1768
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,280
that the claims here are very very

1769
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,520
fitted to fit into the same scope as the

1770
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,119
trustworthiness vectors

1771
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,280
uh that are defined in the trustworthy

1772
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,799
path routing id

1773
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,000
uh from eric so uh we were talking about

1774
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,640
that and

1775
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,720
and uh like uh like designing and

1776
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,319
modeling how this fits

1777
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,119
for quite a while now and now the

1778
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:57,119
authors decided of both drafts

1779
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,680
decided that we will create and break

1780
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,799
out

1781
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:04,400
a certain id that is new that will only

1782
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,680
encompass the trustworthiness vectors

1783
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,520
and those corresponding claims as

1784
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,920
described in the trustee path routing id

1785
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:12,640
today

1786
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,599
and we will bucket the suit claims also

1787
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,119
into that draft

1788
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,880
which probably means that we will

1789
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,559
abandon this

1790
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,119
claims draft as it is right now and we

1791
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,079
will

1792
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,160
recombine it into an information model

1793
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,440
about claims

1794
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,599
for trustworthiness about trustworthy

1795
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,640
can be used

1796
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,720
primarily in attestation results but

1797
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,119
also in evidence we think

1798
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,480
depending on the uh refinement of events

1799
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,240
created by the tester

1800
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,680
so we assume that on both sets of

1801
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,839
conceptual messages these claims

1802
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,680
could be uh it could be appearing or

1803
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,960
could be used in

1804
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,400
and well our plan is well after uh

1805
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,200
fleshing out the content today uh to

1806
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,400
start a new

1807
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,240
and and increase the scope here a little

1808
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,599
bit this

1809
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:02,720
addresses i think some of the questions

1810
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,000
uh uh raised by kathleen very early on

1811
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,480
uh about this could be just device

1812
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,520
centric

1813
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,760
people might not be looking at this i

1814
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,000
accidentally share the same sentiment

1815
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,319
and so but from i guess a different

1816
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:18,000
point of view at a different angle

1817
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,480
but i think maybe we are converging

1818
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,680
towards a

1819
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,720
a two draft system here one is the the

1820
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:25,440
sets

1821
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,920
and then the usage of the sets and one

1822
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:28,640
is the uh

1823
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,599
claims set that will be made use of

1824
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,079
inside of these sets uh this might make

1825
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,680
a lot of sense maybe not

1826
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,319
a little bit of more discussion might be

1827
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:39,680
interesting here

1828
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,359
uh but uh i'm relatively uh optimistic

1829
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,119
that this is the right way to go so for

1830
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,200
now and now our next step is to to

1831
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,240
combine

1832
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,599
the portions of the trp id and the

1833
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,280
claims id for suit into a new iim

1834
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:58,640
and lets go from there so are there any

1835
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,720
comments and or questions about this

1836
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,640
you see that lawrence orton is mike yeah

1837
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,520
hi yeah

1838
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,720
can you hear me yeah we can hear you um

1839
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,359
so i was looking to draft real quick and

1840
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,000
i trying to understand the relationship

1841
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,839
to like eat cwt or jwd

1842
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,640
i mean it seems like you can't just or

1843
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,559
it doesn't doesn't seem right to define

1844
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:31,760
claims in a

1845
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,920
in a vacuum without kind of saying what

1846
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,839
the framework for

1847
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,680
conveying the claims are so um

1848
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:44,079
is this intended to be uh cwt claims gw

1849
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,799
jwt claims eat claims

1850
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,839
how is that relationship there and

1851
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,359
wouldn't you have normative reference to

1852
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,920
one of those

1853
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,200
i think that eat is a very uh

1854
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:00,160
uh direct candidate for a actual

1855
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,000
representation of these claims

1856
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,760
to instantiate them in a format

1857
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,359
conveyed via protocol um they

1858
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,599
we are calling them claims already uh

1859
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,039
adhering to the architecture and

1860
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:13,680
therefore

1861
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,799
also to the eat terminology and

1862
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,759
yes uh i think we could uh highlight at

1863
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:20,719
the very early

1864
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,040
uh beginning of the new idea that we are

1865
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,080
planning here

1866
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,839
um that these uh can be for example

1867
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:31,040
instantiated by an eat that's absolutely

1868
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,679
i think in scope luckily because both

1869
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:34,880
conceptual messages

1870
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:37,120
uh evidence and attestation results are

1871
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,880
in scope of the current charter

1872
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,000
and therefore also are covered by eat i

1873
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:42,479
think

1874
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,479
maybe eid is more on the evidence side

1875
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,479
but that is something we could flesh

1876
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,399
out along the way how eat and

1877
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,839
attestation results

1878
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,040
relates i mean you underst

1879
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,920
understand like you just define a claim

1880
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,198
in the abstract doesn't

1881
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:00,399
doesn't don't you need to

1882
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,920
pin that down into some sort of a system

1883
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,279
like jwt cwt or or i mean is it does it

1884
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:08,479
make sense to define

1885
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,560
claims without saying something like

1886
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,158
that

1887
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:14,000
no i don't think it's necessary this is

1888
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,560
basically about the uh

1889
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,279
assessment of the the the uh item in

1890
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:19,679
hand

1891
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,279
as also basically it's it's the

1892
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,279
attestation result set

1893
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:25,679
so initially we thought it's actually

1894
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:26,799
not the core

1895
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:30,000
scope of each first of all but also then

1896
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,080
in the past like four months we realized

1897
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,520
some of these could be

1898
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,399
directly created as evidence claims by a

1899
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:37,120
tester

1900
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,000
so they could fall in the scope of each

1901
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:40,880
and then

1902
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,799
for now our working thesis says yeah

1903
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:43,920
these claims

1904
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,719
are useful for both sides the conceptual

1905
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:47,279
type

1906
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,040
that is evidence and the conceptual

1907
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,880
message type that is

1908
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,359
attestation results and i don't see a

1909
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,360
problem with defining

1910
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,800
claims here in the scope without a tie

1911
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,480
into a format

1912
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,719
we can we could extend the information

1913
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:05,040
model part and it's a little bit

1914
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,440
data model-esque in it at the moment but

1915
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,719
we could tie into

1916
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,239
that uh i actually included cdda that is

1917
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,679
based on uh the each id

1918
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,640
so i think the the threshold of saying

1919
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:19,600
somehow

1920
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,400
this is this can be used by each is very

1921
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,840
low

1922
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,120
yeah okay um and then uh we will be

1923
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,600
uh putting text into eat that says it

1924
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,560
can be used for

1925
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,840
attestation results yeah and we have to

1926
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,760
really think a little bit about that i

1927
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,679
think that is fine

1928
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,640
but we also have to make clear do we

1929
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,560
really want that so that is another

1930
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,679
decision made lightly i think but uh i

1931
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:47,600
also i'm optimistic that we will find a

1932
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,920
good way to phrase this

1933
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,560
okay we need we need to keep rolling so

1934
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,679
dave

1935
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,520
if it's quick we'll cut the cue at you

1936
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,760
um yeah i assume that this presentation

1937
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,159
is about the draft perk holes the rat

1938
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,280
suit claims

1939
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,600
uh although you didn't say that um and i

1940
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,880
just want to say that

1941
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,239
that the teep uh working group depends

1942
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:11,440
on suit and rats

1943
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,080
the cheap protocol has a normative

1944
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,840
dependency currently

1945
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:18,560
on having the claims that are in the

1946
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,000
draft that i just mentioned which i

1947
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,199
assume is the one that hank is referring

1948
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:22,159
to

1949
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:24,159
in which case yes what's blocking the

1950
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,360
implementation is

1951
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,400
actually getting values assigned

1952
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,040
in for using your teeth needs to use it

1953
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,040
neat so to lawrence's comment

1954
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,120
uh teep is expecting those claims to

1955
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,719
appear in eats and it needs values

1956
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:37,600
assigned

1957
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,360
sooner than later and so we hope that

1958
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,040
the rats working group will do something

1959
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,880
with this to unblock repeat thanks

1960
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:47,600
okay thank you for that input so yeah we

1961
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,719
will uh

1962
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:51,760
not rush this but we will expedite a

1963
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,000
clear statement how claims in it could

1964
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,239
look like if you are really have a hard

1965
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,959
dependency here

1966
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,640
critique session

1967
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,280
i'm sorry dave just a tip session yeah

1968
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,640
when i got when i present the tea

1969
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,000
protocol in the teach session

1970
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,320
i'll uh talk about teeps use so if

1971
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,239
anybody also wants to discuss this more

1972
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:23,600
we have a little bit of time in teeth

1973
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,800
all right can we move on

1974
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,280
thank you

1975
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,719
can you hear me yes we can

1976
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,400
good okay so i'd like to talk about uh

1977
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,440
uccs um

1978
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,599
so if we can move on to the next slide

1979
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,719
so the use case for uccs

1980
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,760
is the is to convey uh

1981
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,239
a token typically an eat or something

1982
01:12:58,239 --> 01:12:59,280
like it

1983
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,600
uh over a secure channel that already

1984
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,560
authenticates

1985
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:04,960
uh both endpoints and provides integrity

1986
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,120
protection

1987
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,480
and may optionally provide

1988
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,400
confidentiality the

1989
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,840
essential idea behind this

1990
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,120
is that in many use cases if you already

1991
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,560
have a secure channel

1992
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,000
the battery overhead or the

1993
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,440
uh radio bandwidth overhead

1994
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,960
of further signing and or encrypting

1995
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,679
uh in the cose form is essentially

1996
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,920
unnecessary from a security perspective

1997
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,960
so in this case we are assuming that the

1998
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,320
two endpoints the tester and the

1999
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,280
verifier

2000
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,480
are trusted in some sense so examples

2001
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,040
might be

2002
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,560
a te conveying um

2003
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,960
attestation evidence to a service

2004
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,199
provider using tls

2005
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,520
or a global platform secure element

2006
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,040
using scp-03 or scp-11 these are

2007
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,840
secure channel protocols that provide

2008
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,880
essentially provide authentication and

2009
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,080
integrity protection

2010
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,199
and usually also confidentiality we can

2011
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,199
also consider that jwt

2012
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:15,600
already supports the algorithm none

2013
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,080
from the perspective of security we have

2014
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,840
limitations

2015
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,199
that we like to discuss and that are

2016
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:23,840
discussed in more detail in the draft

2017
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,920
but essentially the security properties

2018
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,360
of attestation evidence are only

2019
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,719
guaranteed when they're within the

2020
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,080
secure channel

2021
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,320
if the tester and verifier are trusted

2022
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,920
then

2023
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,080
the assumption is that the verifier is

2024
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,920
going to

2025
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,440
manage the attestation evidence in a

2026
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,080
trustworthy

2027
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:45,280
fashion but that is somewhat out of

2028
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,599
scope

2029
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,360
and then there are some discussions

2030
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,760
about the nature of privacy preserving

2031
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,640
secure channels and how to work with

2032
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:55,840
those

2033
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,400
so can we so the document was published

2034
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,880
in a zero one and zero two draft

2035
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,480
um most of the comments were made on the

2036
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:05,840
zero two draft

2037
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,480
so uh if we move to the next slide

2038
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,920
i've tried to go quickly through

2039
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,400
uh the comments that we've received and

2040
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,000
how they have been

2041
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,440
addressed so the comments from rus

2042
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:24,880
uh most the the must requirements have

2043
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,880
been rewritten both to clarify them and

2044
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,719
to reduce the strength

2045
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,280
and we note that integrity protection is

2046
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:33,120
only provided in both directions where

2047
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,000
confidentiality is needed

2048
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,080
uh from jessica fitzgerald mckay and

2049
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,199
mike jenkins

2050
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,840
uh we had essentially four comments uh

2051
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,840
three of which have been addressed

2052
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,159
and one uh which was the comment that a

2053
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:47,760
static symmetric key can only

2054
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,400
authenticate a net not an entity

2055
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:54,320
um i haven't been able to come up with a

2056
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,800
a good answer to that other than to say

2057
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,960
i don't think it's important in respect

2058
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,080
of

2059
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,199
um of of this specification it applies

2060
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,719
in many other scenarios where

2061
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:07,280
cryptography is used and we

2062
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:12,239
we don't address quite that nuanced uh

2063
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,520
distinction uh others seemed to agree

2064
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,480
uh in the discussion on mailing lists so

2065
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,880
next slide

2066
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,760
uh so we had from lawrence there should

2067
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,159
be a minimal discussion of security and

2068
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:26,960
i'm afraid

2069
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:30,480
lawrence that the coverage in draft 3

2070
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,080
which hank put out i think yesterday

2071
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,159
is actually fairly extensive largely

2072
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,000
because of the feedback that we received

2073
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,280
from others

2074
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,000
it certainly goes beyond where i has had

2075
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,040
envisaged going

2076
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,920
so jim shad had requested that we

2077
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,800
have some more detailed correspondence

2078
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
of secure channel security with

2079
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,120
equivalent cose objects and that is

2080
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,239
something that we have

2081
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:01,440
tried to cover so we can move on to the

2082
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:02,239
next

2083
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:06,480
um slide and this is really the

2084
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,320
the the meat of um of what i'm asking

2085
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,239
uh we need to find an appropriate

2086
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,679
working group for

2087
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:18,400
uccs uh draft to be completed

2088
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,320
the proposal that i have and i think is

2089
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,560
supported by the other authors

2090
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,480
is that we should do this work in rats

2091
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,239
because it's where the experts and the

2092
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:27,760
interested parties are

2093
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,640
we believe that it is in scope because

2094
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,320
the main use case that is driving the

2095
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:33,280
specification

2096
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,880
arises within rats and in particular

2097
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,880
the the driver for creating the

2098
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,920
specification

2099
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:44,080
came from work that i am doing based on

2100
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,199
uh the rat's work

2101
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:48,960
inside global platform and that i am

2102
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:51,040
doing uh equally in

2103
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,360
insider a collaboration that involves a

2104
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,120
trusted computing group

2105
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,159
and so that's sort of from

2106
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,080
from my perspective it seems like the

2107
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,159
right place to do this

2108
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,159
uh and to ensure that we remain aligned

2109
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,640
with uh with rats fully in terms of the

2110
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:07,760
the entire

2111
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:13,600
model uh other proposals uh so jessica

2112
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,880
proposed kozai uh jim shad was

2113
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:19,440
quite strongly opposed to that uh his

2114
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,120
feeling was that

2115
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,719
within the kosai working group the

2116
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,719
correct answer to

2117
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:28,400
uccs would be you should use kosai

2118
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,440
ira also was against and both jim

2119
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,280
and ira suggested as an alternative ace

2120
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,199
um i would as i say myself and i think

2121
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:40,640
on behalf of the authors we feel that

2122
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,080
rats is more appropriate

2123
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,600
uh given that it ties very specifically

2124
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,159
to

2125
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:48,239
work that's being done in other bodies

2126
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,440
based

2127
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,840
on the open standardization work that

2128
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,440
rats is doing

2129
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,600
so i guess um if we move on to the next

2130
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,920
page

2131
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,400
i'm going to take the questions in the

2132
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,320
queue first before you move on sure

2133
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,880
no that's fine we can do that okay so

2134
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,000
dave thaler who's

2135
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,159
there first

2136
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,560
that's from before i'd i've met not

2137
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:17,360
being cute go ahead

2138
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,159
i guess that makes it me um we

2139
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,760
considered doing something very similar

2140
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,040
to this in suit

2141
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,840
and uh we eventually got a security

2142
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,560
review

2143
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,679
uh which told us that this was a bad

2144
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:34,239
idea

2145
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,800
for suit um and i'm just gonna give you

2146
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,120
the the um the sort of the rundown of

2147
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,320
why that was

2148
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,280
um i i'm not exactly sure if it applies

2149
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:43,920
equally

2150
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,040
in this context so the concern

2151
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:50,320
was that um in in

2152
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,520
suit specifically the idea was that

2153
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,840
um a a document that describes only

2154
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,600
channel information could be

2155
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,440
authenticated by an existing secure

2156
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:01,920
channel

2157
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,199
um not anything else so um things like

2158
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,520
signing off on exact firmware content

2159
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:08,719
wasn't allowed but

2160
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,639
exact but just uh channel information

2161
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:15,760
um and the feedback that we were given

2162
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,800
was that uh this would allow

2163
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,719
an attacker that successfully

2164
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,080
compromises

2165
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,719
the channel security to pivot very

2166
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:26,000
quickly through your network

2167
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,880
and then take over other things because

2168
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,920
it would allow them to

2169
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,520
issue uh requests through that channel

2170
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,639
um and so in the end we actually removed

2171
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:37,280
that

2172
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,679
because it uh removed some defense in

2173
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:40,480
depth and

2174
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,199
introduced a new possibility of an

2175
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:44,880
attacker pivoting rapidly

2176
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,080
and so i i guess this come came back to

2177
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,000
the uh the standard cryptographic

2178
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,920
doctrine of using one key for one

2179
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:52,800
purpose

2180
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,239
um so i i guess i would ask you to

2181
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,239
consider whether that applies to this

2182
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,839
uh scenario as well

2183
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:07,840
so we've certainly done uh

2184
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,320
a reasonable amount of analysis

2185
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,040
ourselves

2186
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,159
i i think that it's something that is

2187
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,480
perhaps open for further discussion uh

2188
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,400
within within this use case

2189
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,320
uh because it is for the conveyance only

2190
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,199
of attestation evidence

2191
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:25,840
i think there is a a question as to what

2192
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,480
the

2193
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,520
as to what an attacker could do

2194
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,120
if they took control of the secure

2195
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,040
channel other than

2196
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,199
to tamper with the attestation evidence

2197
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,080
itself

2198
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,600
i think that any any any attack then

2199
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,080
becomes a little bit second order

2200
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,400
but i i so i think the use case here is

2201
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,040
slightly different in that there's no

2202
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,360
direct control of system behavior but

2203
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,800
clearly there is likely to be an

2204
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,440
indirect

2205
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,400
control aspect

2206
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,960
uh but the the the whole option that the

2207
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:57,840
whole approach is

2208
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,040
optional and it does i mean the

2209
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:03,600
the major use case that we see at global

2210
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,400
platform is

2211
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,880
is is in the case of secure elements and

2212
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:08,560
here we're talking about a

2213
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,000
an eal4 plus hardened

2214
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,199
security environment so something which

2215
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:19,360
is whether rightly or not is inherently

2216
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,840
believed to be reasonably secure against

2217
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,480
attack

2218
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,639
so i don't know if that helps to answer

2219
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:27,840
the question

2220
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,000
so i do appreciate all of that all i'm

2221
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,679
suggesting is that if this

2222
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:34,159
is a key that can only be used in one

2223
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:35,840
situation i'm sure it's fine

2224
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,440
but if you've got keys that can be

2225
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,239
reused across multiple use cases

2226
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,960
then this uh becomes more concerning now

2227
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,520
in

2228
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,800
in this case and within all the

2229
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,800
scenarios that we're considering

2230
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,120
uh essentially the key material is used

2231
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,639
only to secure the um

2232
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,040
to secure the the the transport

2233
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,040
any any anyone else in the queue i'm not

2234
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,320
sure i

2235
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:11,040
i don't know how to find that yeah and

2236
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,560
then hank

2237
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,480
yeah so this is an example of one of the

2238
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,920
reasons why i think there should be less

2239
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,800
discussion

2240
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,880
about security i know the horse is kind

2241
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,639
of dead and i don't want to

2242
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,480
beat it anymore but this is just an

2243
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,159
example of

2244
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,920
you know this is not a protocol that has

2245
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,600
any keys in it this is just saying we're

2246
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,760
not using keys so

2247
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,960
you know it seems like brendan's

2248
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,719
discussion should be in the document

2249
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:34,320
that describes the protocol that has the

2250
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,679
keys it shouldn't be in this

2251
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,400
uccs document and that was that was why

2252
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,280
i was going out

2253
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,800
saying there should be less coverage

2254
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,400
about security

2255
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,159
anyway that just that's kind of

2256
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:45,440
informative

2257
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,000
a second comment is quite happy to see

2258
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:48,560
this

2259
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,880
adopted in rats and their comment is i

2260
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,320
have done an implementation of this

2261
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,719
that's interesting to know so thanks

2262
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,800
lawrence

2263
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,480
yeah so this is hank uh not trying to

2264
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:10,320
again also beat the dead horse sorry um

2265
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,800
um this is uh uh i think it's a good

2266
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,199
reason to tie this tourette's then

2267
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:18,239
first and if some other application like

2268
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,280
suits would

2269
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,400
do this and they won't as we just heard

2270
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,800
they would write their own id and tell

2271
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,400
people how to use it

2272
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,360
or in this case basically not use it so

2273
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,000
i think that's

2274
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,239
that's the reason why we have to tie it

2275
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:33,600
to a scope

2276
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,360
and not just let it free-floating

2277
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,760
without any security considerations

2278
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,320
and and again i think thank you brandon

2279
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,000
that's an excellent

2280
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,239
reason why to tie it here tourette

2281
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,280
okay so if hank has done uh let me go so

2282
01:24:59,280 --> 01:24:59,920
i i think

2283
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,199
blending what what got said by the

2284
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,320
previous speakers

2285
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,920
and i haven't scrubbed the document

2286
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,760
itself it seems like we have a couple of

2287
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,960
different options

2288
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:10,880
it sounds like we can come up with a

2289
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:12,400
general purpose claim

2290
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,159
and if we have a general purpose claim

2291
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,520
we would need to cover

2292
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,360
all of the dimensionality of the attack

2293
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,000
surface to include what came up ensued

2294
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,840
what potentially could come up with rats

2295
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,320
and to future proof people misusing it

2296
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,520
in some other way

2297
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,600
and that's i think a very different

2298
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,760
document the alternative here is we

2299
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,480
could say

2300
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,719
hey we want to leverage kind of cbor for

2301
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:33,840
a very specific

2302
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,080
application uh application specific way

2303
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:40,880
it will preclude uses outside of the

2304
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,120
rats use case the way it is documented

2305
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,520
but it will work with the assumptions of

2306
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,800
the deployment environment

2307
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,719
kind of in rats and that's another

2308
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,000
document i think

2309
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,040
the latter clearly fits into into rats

2310
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,239
it makes a lot of sense

2311
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,159
from my view we might need to talk a

2312
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,360
little bit more about

2313
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,360
where the general purpose one would go

2314
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,880
if that's the route we wanted to take

2315
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,639
and how to appropriately document all

2316
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:04,960
the caveats with that particular claim

2317
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,960
from my kind of squint at that document

2318
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,960
it feels like you're leaning towards

2319
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,120
this idea of a narrow use case specific

2320
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,960
claim where you would caveat that you

2321
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,719
can't use it outside of

2322
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,239
outside of the deployment environments

2323
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:17,920
that we have here in rats right

2324
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,600
that's more or less what the text says

2325
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,679
today maybe it could be

2326
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:23,679
stated more strongly but it basically

2327
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,360
says if you're not using this in rats

2328
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,360
it's your problem

2329
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,599
right

2330
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,360
yeah if we keep to that scope it would

2331
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,800
make sense to me at least to keep it in

2332
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,440
this working group

2333
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:41,679
so thank you um i'd like to just get

2334
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,120
a show of hands on interest

2335
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,040
of this draft and so i just started a

2336
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,400
quick poll

2337
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,199
and then if you um have reasons against

2338
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,880
please put that in the chat so we can

2339
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,719
collect that quickly we're running short

2340
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:55,920
on time

2341
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,320
okay so so as a relatively new attender

2342
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,080
i assume that authors do not raise their

2343
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,719
hands here

2344
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,400
um usually it's a hum in a room and

2345
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,520
nobody would know and

2346
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:18,000
and they might okay that's fair enough

2347
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,239
right so i'll let this go another minute

2348
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,199
uh i would like to see a threat model

2349
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:30,080
for this document is there one already

2350
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,199
was a question asked

2351
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,719
and somebody else told them to do it uh

2352
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:38,560
currently there is not a threat model

2353
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,639
beyond um

2354
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,080
the fact that we have tied the

2355
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,400
usage to rats and therefore the rats

2356
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,639
threat mob lighting would be applicable

2357
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,159
maybe that could be fleshed out further

2358
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,320
okay i'm going to end the poll

2359
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,839
and see how this went

2360
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,719
all right so 14

2361
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,840
support and three do not so that's

2362
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,440
pretty good um

2363
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:17,360
we can take this to the list especially

2364
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,199
since we're running short on time

2365
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:22,880
and we can do it more formally there

2366
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:29,840
okay thank you thank you

2367
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,960
all right uh this is eric i'm going to

2368
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,880
talk about the

2369
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,000
threat model sorry the chira model um we

2370
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,040
have done a number of updates since the

2371
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,400
last ietf

2372
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,520
the biggest change has been getting the

2373
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,320
first set of

2374
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,199
yang doctor reviews and i'm going to do

2375
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,800
an update on where we're at

2376
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,280
next slide

2377
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,280
just to recap on the purpose the idea

2378
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,159
here especially

2379
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,000
for network equipment like routers and

2380
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,719
switches we want to go ahead and be able

2381
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,320
to do things like get

2382
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,760
tpm pcrs and log entries in order to

2383
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:20,719
validate

2384
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,679
what has actually been stored in the in

2385
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:24,639
the

2386
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,920
tpms and validate the attestation

2387
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,639
of those devices this is really a yang

2388
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:31,440
model for

2389
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,400
the remote procedure calls in order to

2390
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:35,440
get the information

2391
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,760
out of that um

2392
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,080
out of that device next slide

2393
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,480
there's a relationship to a number of

2394
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,440
other drafts it inherits all the rats

2395
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,400
language from the architecture doc it

2396
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:55,440
inherits the

2397
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,760
context from the draft that nancy talked

2398
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,520
about earlier

2399
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,639
on the network device at the station

2400
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:05,760
and it has some drafts which are also

2401
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,920
inputs like the reference interactions

2402
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,520
so there is a whole bunch

2403
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,320
of context prior to the yang model

2404
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:13,280
that's embedded

2405
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,239
that's why the text is fairly small we

2406
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,360
tried to limit as to the degree possible

2407
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:22,480
the draft just to that yang model

2408
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,040
there are a couple drafts that are

2409
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:26,800
follow-ons to this for example is there

2410
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,480
a device subscription model i'll talk

2411
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,320
briefly about after this

2412
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,600
and there's been already several

2413
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,760
discussions today about the trusted path

2414
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:34,560
routing

2415
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,480
as it relates to the trustworthiness

2416
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,840
vector

2417
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,320
next slide

2418
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,040
there were a few attritions that were

2419
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,000
addressed from version 3 to version 5.

2420
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,120
we eliminated one type of quote that

2421
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,920
was made based on an older version of

2422
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,440
the tpm

2423
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:58,639
per last ietf we said does anybody use

2424
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,719
tpm 1.2 quote 1

2425
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:02,719
answer seems to be no so we just

2426
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,199
eliminated that and nobody complained

2427
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:08,560
um we had other model uh other changes

2428
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,880
that we simplified the yang model

2429
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,280
to do things like pull out information

2430
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,360
from within the signature element coming

2431
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:16,880
out of the tpms

2432
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,159
so that we don't have redundant

2433
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:21,040
information exposed in the yang tree

2434
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,120
we also got a number of yang doctor

2435
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,760
comments that were all covered

2436
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,719
and we repartitioned the draft so that

2437
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:29,679
we had

2438
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:33,440
the yang tree broken out to make it more

2439
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:37,120
readable so one last thing is we define

2440
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:38,000
some example

2441
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,840
remote procedure calls so you can see

2442
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,840
how the quotes

2443
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,840
are retrieved next slide

2444
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,480
within the yang model there really

2445
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,679
aren't any open

2446
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:53,440
issues that i know of other than one we

2447
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,280
were talking about on the list just the

2448
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:56,320
last couple days

2449
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:59,199
saying do we need to add some

2450
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,040
definitions

2451
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:04,480
to the yang tree as it relates to where

2452
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,440
the binary sources of information

2453
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:09,679
are being defined in other words we need

2454
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:11,600
better references in a couple places to

2455
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,120
the source documents from the

2456
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,080
from the trusted computing group there's

2457
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:18,639
also

2458
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,480
a fairly technical thing on xpath to

2459
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,880
make sure that the data validations

2460
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,440
are being done appropriately and the

2461
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,760
first yang dr review didn't actually get

2462
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,639
to that

2463
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,639
so we need a better yang doctor review

2464
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,080
that will be done during working group

2465
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:35,280
last call

2466
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,360
and that's all the open issues that at

2467
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,400
least i know of

2468
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,599
at this point next slide

2469
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:46,960
question of the working group is are we

2470
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,880
ready for working group last call

2471
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,400
we passed the date where we were

2472
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,639
supposed to do working group last call

2473
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,159
and a lot of the reason was we're

2474
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:57,120
waiting for the yang doctor's review

2475
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,040
i think the document is in a decent

2476
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,600
shape forking group last call

2477
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:03,520
the one thing that is i guess

2478
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,280
interesting is that these are mostly

2479
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,840
people who cares about routers and

2480
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:08,159
switches

2481
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:09,679
and the people dumb routers and switches

2482
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:11,199
have done a review so getting a

2483
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:13,360
sufficient group of people saying

2484
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,280
yes we care to go to work in group less

2485
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,120
calls interesting question

2486
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:18,880
but that's where we are right now with

2487
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,639
this document if we're going to close it

2488
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,000
we might as well close it because it

2489
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,320
seems fairly stable i don't know how we

2490
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,280
can progress it

2491
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,800
uh beyond where we're at without going

2492
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,280
there

2493
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,360
so i guess i'll open up the questions

2494
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,800
and thoughts from the chairs but i think

2495
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,800
it's ready to go forward

2496
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:38,000
and that's where we're at so

2497
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,360
so eric did you update the draft

2498
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,320
um along with your authors to include

2499
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,080
the feedback from

2500
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,480
the yang doctors review and i thought

2501
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:50,159
you had mentioned some other comment

2502
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:51,679
with one more issue did i

2503
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,480
miss that or oh no no the uh young

2504
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,120
doctors

2505
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:56,560
updates are all in there they were

2506
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,400
posted quite a while ago when the young

2507
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,760
doctors came in so those

2508
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,000
those are all in there there was one

2509
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
comment just in the last few days

2510
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,600
from jurgen and as far as i think

2511
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,960
you know sometimes it's a little hard to

2512
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,560
know what jurgen's saying i think it's

2513
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,560
actually covered in the text

2514
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,080
the one comment that's still open is

2515
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,760
make references

2516
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,199
to some of the binary formats

2517
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:22,080
and so as far as i can tell the only

2518
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:25,280
thing that's needed is to get the

2519
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,120
references included for what some of the

2520
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,960
binary formats are

2521
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,639
some of them are inherited and that we

2522
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:32,159
can make it a little bit more explicit

2523
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:33,120
it really isn't

2524
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:36,719
a big deal and then the xpath

2525
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,280
validations from the young doctors if we

2526
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:40,800
claim that we're in working group last

2527
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,239
call it will force them to

2528
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,760
answer that and that's that's all i know

2529
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,520
about

2530
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,040
okay so i just started another poll

2531
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,600
i want to get a sense of who has read

2532
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,400
the latest

2533
01:34:54,400 --> 01:35:00,880
version of the chara draft

2534
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,719
i'll run it for a few seconds of course

2535
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,199
that routers and switch people

2536
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,639
there there's fewer than here but we

2537
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:08,320
have to figure out a way to get that uh

2538
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,600
that feedback yeah and and i don't mind

2539
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,280
triggering but i just wanted to get a

2540
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,159
sense here and

2541
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:16,799
and um

2542
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,639
i'm i should have said

2543
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:22,719
the author should not be responding to

2544
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:24,960
this

2545
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:29,840
i am not

2546
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,799
okay i'll give it another

2547
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:41,520
and i think you're right i mean you

2548
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,920
you've gotten feedback on the previous

2549
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,360
two versions i want to say

2550
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,080
okay i'll give it 10 more seconds and

2551
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,080
our author list is what seven

2552
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,840
eight i can't remember

2553
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,400
okay so i will end the poll

2554
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,840
and the results are okay

2555
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,560
so we've had four people and you've had

2556
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,880
the yang doctors so

2557
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,199
um

2558
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,199
i can go ahead and issue

2559
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:30,320
a working group last call

2560
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:33,440
um the question is whether we

2561
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:37,520
we benefit by doing another solicitation

2562
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:39,920
to the yang doctors eric because i know

2563
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:41,920
you spent quite quite a bit of time with

2564
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:44,719
the previous one

2565
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:46,800
oh i have no problem asking them i think

2566
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,639
we get a different response when we go

2567
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:50,560
to work in group last call

2568
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,320
and i've run working group last call

2569
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:53,679
with yang models before

2570
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,560
it is a separate process where they say

2571
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,760
here are the things so

2572
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,199
i i think i don't see a problem in

2573
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:01,199
running in parallel in fact you'll

2574
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:02,560
probably get a better response if it's

2575
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,920
in parallel

2576
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:06,239
well no i mean i i can trigger another

2577
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:07,040
um

2578
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,159
request oh that'd be great yep so before

2579
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:11,920
i triggered a request for an early

2580
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,920
review this would be a working group

2581
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,320
last call really yeah and we could also

2582
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,840
do them have their working group last

2583
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,280
call and then after the response come

2584
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,880
back i mean this

2585
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,520
i'm just trying to close out our our

2586
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,199
timeline it's not like i'm rushing to

2587
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,480
have this complete but i just want to

2588
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,440
make sure

2589
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,119
if it's stable we complete it whether

2590
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:30,719
you want to write have them

2591
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:31,920
get their answers and come back to

2592
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,480
working group it doesn't matter to me

2593
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,960
yeah well no i mean keep in mind that if

2594
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,639
we get a lot of feedback we'll have to

2595
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:40,960
issue another working with last call

2596
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,800
sure so why don't we claim working

2597
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,119
couple s call first to the

2598
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:47,440
young doctors and then bring back the

2599
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,560
results here

2600
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,760
i don't think that they're going to have

2601
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:52,000
a lot of stuff other than

2602
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,040
xpath and others but you never know

2603
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,239
yeah yeah carson highlighted

2604
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:01,040
and thank you hank um for making me look

2605
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:02,560
at the chat

2606
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:05,199
um given that that there are eight

2607
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:06,639
authors in the draft

2608
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,639
plus four that raised their hands i i

2609
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:09,840
think um

2610
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,679
i think we're ready to do the last call

2611
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,480
um and i i will explicitly solicit

2612
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,360
feedback from

2613
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,600
from the young doctors too for the last

2614
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,560
call so

2615
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:25,040
sounds great okay i think we can move on

2616
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:26,480
all right the other one is just a verbal

2617
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,360
update for me on the attestation event

2618
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,080
stream subscription basically all this

2619
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,040
draft does

2620
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,159
excuse me is once we're done

2621
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:40,239
working group last call on the um

2622
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:43,360
on the uh chara draft this says how to

2623
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,080
actually subscribe to the results

2624
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:47,920
there's a bunch of drafts over netconf

2625
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,000
on how to subscribe to the information

2626
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,600
in the yang model

2627
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,320
um and all this would be would be once

2628
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,920
we've gotten the chara model

2629
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,960
complete we might as well adopt

2630
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,520
something on yang's stream subscription

2631
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,040
now there is a

2632
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,719
possibility of uh also including other

2633
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,480
types of things beyond yang models in

2634
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:10,480
the event stream subscription

2635
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,080
and we're just getting some interest

2636
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,000
outside of this which is why i don't

2637
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,679
have any slides or hank doesn't have any

2638
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:16,560
slides

2639
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,159
it is possible the scope is going to

2640
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,679
include more

2641
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,239
than yang subscriptions we're gonna have

2642
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,400
to wait and see how that plays out

2643
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:27,600
but uh this is more of a once we have

2644
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,480
charade

2645
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,639
done and locked we might as well think

2646
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,560
about whether to adopt this

2647
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,880
as well i didn't want to do any new

2648
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,960
information or adoption requests

2649
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:39,840
until we closed out the other and that's

2650
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,199
just a simple update on where we are

2651
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:42,639
with this

2652
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:44,880
okay it sounds like you if you're going

2653
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
to do something more than yang

2654
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,320
you'll need a little bit more time to

2655
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,560
make that into the draft too

2656
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,880
i agree and that's why we're holding off

2657
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,480
on trying to assert what it might be

2658
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,520
until somebody comes up with a

2659
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,920
protect a larger scope if we want to go

2660
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,159
there

2661
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:05,360
sounds good and that's that

2662
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:08,960
thanks eric

2663
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,280
okay

2664
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,159
you gave us a little bit of time back

2665
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:23,839
thank you

2666
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,920
hello everyone can you help me

2667
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:32,080
yes we can hear you okay thank you nancy

2668
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,239
okay i'm melinda uh this drifter

2669
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:40,000
was first permitted in march last year

2670
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,080
so far we have updated it to version

2671
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:48,560
uh three so we have one chance to

2672
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,159
uh this presentation in our draft

2673
01:40:52,159 --> 01:40:57,360
open consider it next slide thank you

2674
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,920
our main consideration from isp

2675
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:07,280
perspective on we can site for

2676
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:10,480
scenario all english rest may be used

2677
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,360
the point we are considering may not be

2678
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,360
quite the same with the use case in

2679
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,040
architecture

2680
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,239
just from our possible requirements

2681
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,638
next

2682
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,040
the first consideration is from our

2683
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,920
access authentication we think there

2684
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:32,639
will be

2685
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,400
uh authentication centers with different

2686
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:40,159
mechanisms for example psk based

2687
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,880
authentication center and ibc based

2688
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:43,960
awesome

2689
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:47,119
authentication center so when a

2690
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:51,440
psk center and ibc center they cannot

2691
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,800
communicate diff directory

2692
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,040
maybe we can use rest to make the

2693
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:58,159
results of

2694
01:41:58,159 --> 01:42:02,719
one center recognized or another

2695
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:06,719
i do i don't sure if this a

2696
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:11,840
this sinner is belongs to rest

2697
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,840
next slide

2698
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:22,000
the second consideration is from the

2699
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,960
application

2700
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,639
level as we all know the limitation of

2701
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,320
this resource many applications need

2702
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,920
operators to provide business

2703
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,280
authentication service we simply divide

2704
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,800
them into

2705
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:41,760
certificate based and non-certificate

2706
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,719
based

2707
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,199
so when class business authentication is

2708
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:46,400
required

2709
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:49,679
can we use rest to prove one's identity

2710
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,199
to the other

2711
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:53,679
of course we should have requirements

2712
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,119
for

2713
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:58,800
attestation results a brexit policy

2714
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,159
the protocol to transmit

2715
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:07,280
the as testation results

2716
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:10,400
especially we have to stress the secure

2717
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:15,360
security of the protocol

2718
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:18,320
next slide

2719
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,000
and the third consideration point is

2720
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
about virtualization based

2721
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,760
system virtualization system also use

2722
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,480
ras

2723
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,600
based on vtpn but uh i i haven't seen

2724
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:32,480
the what group

2725
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:35,920
dress jeffs have mentioned it

2726
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:40,800
so i so i have a question

2727
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,040
well what group cover the scope of

2728
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:47,040
virtualization

2729
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:53,679
next slide

2730
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:57,600
this third the third the fourth

2731
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:02,320
consideration is about trusted routing

2732
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:07,040
some customers experts experts

2733
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,320
i asked to be able to provide

2734
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,600
trusted link service so we are faced

2735
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,920
with how to form trusted links

2736
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,840
internally and beating isps

2737
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,719
thought maybe we could do it with rest

2738
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:24,239
rooting devices

2739
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:28,639
as a tester and provide evidence

2740
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:33,040
or appraisal result to our translator

2741
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,119
it depends on the detail of

2742
01:44:36,119 --> 01:44:39,119
implementation

2743
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,880
of course the precondition is routine

2744
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:43,679
devices

2745
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:48,239
supports tpn 1.2 or

2746
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:50,959
herb2

2747
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:55,759
or other re-rent standards

2748
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:03,280
next is light

2749
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:06,400
for trusted link issues we can sign

2750
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,679
these two specific scenarios the one

2751
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:13,199
is add a new router to the network

2752
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:16,000
and how to form trusted link with four

2753
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,760
steps

2754
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,119
the first step is to uh the new router

2755
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:22,000
provides

2756
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,040
evidence to the verifier maybe the

2757
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:28,840
oscillator can shorten for the row of

2758
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,760
verifier and the second step

2759
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,280
is the verifier feedback the

2760
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:38,480
result and the step three

2761
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:42,320
is trustworthy assessment

2762
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:46,000
then the orchestrator can forms routine

2763
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:46,639
policy

2764
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,760
and issues them

2765
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,360
instead of after these three

2766
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:58,480
steps the trusted link formed

2767
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,440
next slide

2768
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,239
the other scenario is how to update

2769
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:12,719
the routine devices status

2770
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:16,239
can collect rooting information in real

2771
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:16,880
time

2772
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:20,719
or particularly the information

2773
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:22,080
collected maybe

2774
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,800
include device information log

2775
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,520
information

2776
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,080
fourth information trustee trustee

2777
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:29,040
merger

2778
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:33,119
renders and then

2779
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,639
forms a trusted link based

2780
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:41,840
on users trustworthiness requirements

2781
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:45,280
rest is used for

2782
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,560
is useful for routine devices that

2783
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,280
provide

2784
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:55,600
evidence to the orchestrator

2785
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,960
next the slide mailing you

2786
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:01,119
have somebody on the queue with a

2787
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:02,639
question

2788
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:05,199
question

2789
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:07,520
eric you you have a question you're in

2790
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,199
the queue yeah

2791
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:12,320
i then i see depth definitely

2792
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,040
a question

2793
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,719
identity authentication search ibc

2794
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:21,760
yes yes on the

2795
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,960
on the use cases there are uh

2796
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,119
drafts that are identifying the use

2797
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:28,000
cases

2798
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,719
inside for example the trusted path

2799
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:31,280
routing

2800
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:33,840
uh defines the previous use case as well

2801
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,560
as a potential solution to it

2802
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,840
have you looked at these drafts and do

2803
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,520
you have any thoughts on how those

2804
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,199
drafts might

2805
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:44,719
accomplish the use case that you're

2806
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:50,080
identifying here

2807
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:53,119
i'm sorry i i don't get your uh point

2808
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:57,440
exactly can you repay

2809
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,480
for example the routing use case

2810
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,000
um there is a draft on the routing use

2811
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,880
case that defines both the use case as

2812
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:07,679
well

2813
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,360
as how to solve it with network

2814
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,000
protocols have you had a chance to read

2815
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:12,560
the

2816
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:18,159
draft on the routing use case

2817
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:21,199
do you mean the uh draft for the

2818
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:24,960
trusted what's the vendor that draft

2819
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,440
yes it does answer the how to build a

2820
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,840
trusted network so the question is

2821
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,719
is your draft looking to in the chapter

2822
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:33,920
we'll see vendor

2823
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,520
this uh uh we keep same with you

2824
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,239
with your uh ideas

2825
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:47,840
so what is the purpose of as what meant

2826
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,320
i'm sorry i'm just trying to understand

2827
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,320
the purpose of this draft

2828
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:59,280
there is a use case draft which exists

2829
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,000
that michael

2830
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,480
has been stewarding there's a use

2831
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,199
there's a deployment draft

2832
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:08,800
that is the protocols um so i guess my

2833
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,920
question is

2834
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,239
is how are you trying to add new use

2835
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:14,639
cases to michael's

2836
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:17,520
use case draft are you trying to define

2837
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,119
additional use cases

2838
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:21,440
i'm just trying to understand what

2839
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:22,880
you're trying to do with this

2840
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:26,480
draft okay

2841
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,040
my title is about use case but maybe

2842
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:29,760
it's

2843
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,800
it is not so exactly we just

2844
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,840
uh give our consideration for

2845
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:40,000
from our uh perspective

2846
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:43,840
your advice our uh

2847
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:47,440
use case to be refined in the uh

2848
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:51,519
in your draft is the right

2849
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,199
maybe not my draft i'm thinking more of

2850
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,119
michael's draft because michael has a

2851
01:49:57,119 --> 01:49:59,679
use case

2852
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,080
michael maybe you can chime in because

2853
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,520
is this draft

2854
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,920
adding to your draft that's what i'm

2855
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:11,520
feeling

2856
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:15,040
okay i understand your

2857
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,480
uh maybe it's a

2858
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:22,000
good advice because i do not know how

2859
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:26,560
uh this next step of my draft

2860
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,719
well because i'm nervous the use case or

2861
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,480
the consideration we have

2862
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:39,839
we have cured it is bureau to rest

2863
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,560
so roman do you want me to read your

2864
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:46,239
comment you're next in the queue

2865
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,760
or i was just going to hop in i mean i'm

2866
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:51,760
i wanted to reiterate kind of from a

2867
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:52,960
procedural

2868
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:54,960
procedural kind of process i'm thrilled

2869
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,960
we have concrete text in writing

2870
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,440
that couches use cases uh we have a

2871
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:00,400
couple of them

2872
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:02,080
and we have a new document here thank

2873
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,080
you for bringing it that

2874
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:06,000
tries to discuss potentially additional

2875
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,159
use cases having said that i wanted to

2876
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,599
remind the working group that we are

2877
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:11,679
currently chartered not to publish any

2878
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:12,880
use case documents

2879
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,520
so they are used primarily as we have

2880
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,719
the charter scope now

2881
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,560
to help inform the discussion but they

2882
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,560
would not pop out as an rfc

2883
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:23,280
on the back side

2884
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,239
oh understand

2885
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,760
i just want to ask is there anyone

2886
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,760
interested about

2887
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:40,560
our contents

2888
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,159
maybe we can deter it together because

2889
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:45,280
the uh draft

2890
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,920
is not so perfect now we have many

2891
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,040
things to do

2892
01:51:49,040 --> 01:52:02,320
oh next

2893
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:05,360
any other questions

2894
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:14,000
no so mailing i i would suggest that you

2895
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,719
take this up to the mail list

2896
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:21,599
and um if if you can clarify

2897
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:24,400
the purpose of the draft as roman just

2898
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:26,800
stated right the use cases are to

2899
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,080
instill the discussion for the solutions

2900
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:33,599
um that are being put forward the intent

2901
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:34,639
is for not

2902
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:38,080
um to have that the use case documents

2903
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:39,599
to actually be published as

2904
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:43,119
rfcs so um

2905
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:44,960
if you can make the purpose of what

2906
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,719
you're trying to achieve more clear and

2907
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,400
do it through the mail list i think that

2908
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:49,760
will help us

2909
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,599
right yes maybe your use case is the

2910
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:56,719
started point we uh come to the

2911
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:59,440
rest but we also want to do their deep

2912
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,119
research on the trustee

2913
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,360
link

2914
01:53:06,480 --> 01:53:09,519
dave stairs on the queue

2915
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,800
oh yeah dave go ahead maybe i need to

2916
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:13,679
ask a

2917
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:16,719
couple questions about whether stuff was

2918
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:18,639
in rats in the first couple of slides

2919
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,880
and i

2920
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,599
couldn't tell for sure but i think the

2921
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,440
answer is yes to the various questions

2922
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,199
that you asked about whether

2923
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,719
something was appropriate for rats i

2924
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:30,560
think i understood the first diagram

2925
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:32,560
i didn't understand the second one but

2926
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:34,159
out of the first three or four questions

2927
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:35,679
you asked i think the answer is going to

2928
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:36,000
be

2929
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,400
yes yes and yes but the questions you'd

2930
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:40,400
ask me like

2931
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:41,599
looked like you were looking for an

2932
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:43,119
answer from the rats working group i

2933
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:44,560
just wanted to give an answer on behalf

2934
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:46,320
of at least one of the rats architecture

2935
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,360
authors but

2936
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,679
yes i think that rats can be used for at

2937
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:50,880
least some of the scenarios that you

2938
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:51,679
mentioned

2939
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:53,440
eric commented on the latter ones but i

2940
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:54,560
just wanted to help answer it for the

2941
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:57,040
former ones

2942
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:09,840
thanks dave

2943
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:14,239
okay may lane michael richardson who's

2944
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,880
um one of the main editors for the use

2945
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:18,000
case draft said he

2946
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,639
he's happy to to collaborate with you um

2947
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,400
vis-a-vis the use case uh draft that's

2948
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,920
currently running but uh noting

2949
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:33,760
roman's comment on publication so

2950
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:37,040
um so if we can take that to the mail

2951
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:40,400
list i think that would be good

2952
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:44,239
yes thank you for this and i have uh

2953
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:48,880
now i have ideal for my use case

2954
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,400
great thank you for presenting

2955
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,280
okay so we have an illustrious five

2956
01:54:55,280 --> 01:55:05,840
minutes left for the open mic

2957
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,679
okay hank you're in the queue

2958
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:19,040
yeah sorry i was uh

2959
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,400
so it was late i was a little bit

2960
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,159
distracted with the um

2961
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:24,639
millings uh um questions so i think the

2962
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:25,920
very first uh

2963
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,360
diagram so i also have to agree with

2964
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,199
dave first i think that's the easiest

2965
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:29,840
part

2966
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:32,159
and then then the uh um the first

2967
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:32,880
scenario

2968
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:36,159
very much looks like the composite um

2969
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:38,800
device scenario uh so i think it's an

2970
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:39,920
extension to the

2971
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:43,599
composite device multi-chest eye

2972
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,920
section in the architecture and and

2973
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:47,679
maybe you can start from that for

2974
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,920
the first uh scenario the second

2975
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,880
scenario

2976
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,719
uh with the two relying parties one of

2977
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:54,320
them is a certificate and one

2978
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:57,920
non-certificate um i might need a use

2979
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:58,320
case

2980
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,719
like like your user story like like what

2981
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:01,599
what messages

2982
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:03,679
actually involved here what what what's

2983
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:05,199
the problem in the production

2984
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:07,040
environment that is solved

2985
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,599
because i i could see of course a

2986
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:12,320
attestation result to some extent

2987
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:15,679
if it's science could uh substitute a

2988
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:19,040
uh certificate somehow but i

2989
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:20,800
i don't know all the moving parts here

2990
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:22,480
so i think uh the second

2991
01:56:22,480 --> 01:56:24,880
scenario would benefit from a fleshed

2992
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:25,920
out uh

2993
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:27,599
use case scenario and i unfortunately

2994
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:29,199
forgot the third item but

2995
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:42,719
i will come back to this later

2996
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:46,639
okay um open make time dave thaler

2997
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:47,679
you're on the queue

2998
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:51,360
thanks for that hank

2999
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,040
all right uh open white question um so i

3000
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,320
mentioned that the uh

3001
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,400
cheap working group has a dependency on

3002
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,760
rats right which

3003
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,639
uh was kind of the first best customer

3004
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:03,040
for

3005
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,800
rats where another working group was

3006
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:06,239
taking dependency on it

3007
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,159
um i think you know jeremy had talked

3008
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:09,440
about you know global platform and

3009
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,199
things but my question for open mic time

3010
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:11,920
is are folks

3011
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:15,040
aware of other ietf working groups that

3012
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:16,639
are looking at taking a dependency on

3013
01:57:16,639 --> 01:57:17,119
rats

3014
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:19,599
um some of you may remember during the

3015
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:21,199
buff time

3016
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:24,639
i had given a conjecture that every

3017
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:27,920
authentication use case was an

3018
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,400
attestation use case and so there might

3019
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,920
be a large number of things that are

3020
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:33,760
potential customers i just wonder are

3021
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,960
there other things that might be

3022
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,639
normative dependencies coming in from

3023
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,560
other working groups right now so

3024
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:40,960
there you go

3025
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,920
excellent question i'm not aware of any

3026
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:50,320
can i answer the question michael

3027
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,480
richardson um one

3028
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,639
thing which is not adopted and not well

3029
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:55,920
understood or accepted

3030
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:59,199
is in the reprise um

3031
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:02,560
excuse me the add uh working group um is

3032
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:04,000
that here already and

3033
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,360
i have a document on especially

3034
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:11,199
uh an attestation as to the

3035
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:14,639
uh quality and privacy of the

3036
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:18,320
um dns server that you are going to talk

3037
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:19,040
to

3038
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,639
um and i've tried to make it clear that

3039
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:26,000
we should not be reinventing rat here um

3040
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,639
and uh the working group doesn't really

3041
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:30,239
understand why it's an

3042
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:31,679
aspiration and hasn't accepted the

3043
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:34,159
document at all yet um

3044
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:38,400
so um i if anything we have some

3045
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,560
explanations and evangelizing to do

3046
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:41,440
elsewhere

3047
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:44,000
what is a test placement and why it's a

3048
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,840
useful thing

3049
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,280
i think you raise a a good point michael

3050
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:06,400
um i guess

3051
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,920
i'm kind of scratching my head i guess

3052
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:09,599
i'm not fully awake yet in

3053
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,599
how we could raise that awareness

3054
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:12,800
because i think you're right

3055
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:17,280
um the question to you would be that

3056
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:21,679
um if you need help with the add

3057
01:59:21,679 --> 01:59:25,599
working group how we could in

3058
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:28,840
threat participation help raise that

3059
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:31,840
awareness

3060
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,440
i would say that primitively the

3061
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:35,199
simplest is we should get our documents

3062
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:36,880
published that's the probably one of the

3063
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,800
simplest ways to be able to do this and

3064
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:42,840
go read this done um but

3065
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:45,920
um uh

3066
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:49,040
i i think that that that perhaps

3067
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:54,080
it's just a question of um

3068
01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:58,800
uh um making our use pieces more

3069
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:02,480
uh uh easy to comprehend

3070
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:05,599
um and uh

3071
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:07,679
that that may just mean we have some

3072
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:08,960
better fly that

3073
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,880
more people are using more commonly

3074
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:15,599
so there's some value i think in common

3075
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:18,400
messaging here

3076
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,119
okay

3077
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:26,320
and i think with that we are out of time

3078
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,960
uh i will just highlight yari did post

3079
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:30,000
in the comment

3080
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,199
uh that he also has something similar

3081
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:35,280
in the eight i'm presuming it's in the

3082
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,320
add group

3083
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:42,719
on yari draftarco dns confidential

3084
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,880
okay so with that we're out of time um

3085
