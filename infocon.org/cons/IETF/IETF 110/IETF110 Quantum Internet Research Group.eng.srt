1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
we're still looking for somebody to uh

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,639
to take notes

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,440
if anybody like does their meetings like

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,639
me they wait for the outlook

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,000
notification to come up and

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
then they connect so it might be

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,440
so i'd include a few minutes the

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,800
beginning of the meeting for people to

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,199
connect

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,439
well we're up to the 31 participants

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,880
here so we're going pretty quick

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,240
i haven't looked to see how many people

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,479
total or registered for ihf this time

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
around

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
i know there was uh some fussing uh last

16
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
time or time before about

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
need echo but i'll tell you what when

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,799
meat echo

19
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,159
works i really think it's a wonderful

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,560
tool and i think it's great

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
people did yeah thanks robin for

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,840
volunteering to be jabber scribe

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,960
uh yes we're still looking for a minutes

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,000
taker though

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
today's meeting is shorter than usual

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,840
so it should be an easier job than usual

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
any volunteers for a minute taking well

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,439
we'll ask again at something but

29
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,639
yeah it's about time to start

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
one or two more minutes to come in yeah

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,360
so we'll well since

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,040
yes since time is starting let's slowly

33
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,560
go through the note 12

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,919
it's on your screens and once we get to

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,720
the

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,879
agenda we'll start the meeting properly

37
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,839
all right so the

38
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,280
important part on this slide is the ipr

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,560
disclosure rules that

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
everything and these meetings can be

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
made public

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,879
and that will all be respectful

43
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400
and another key point is

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,440
the irtf is a is not standards

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
development

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
unlike the ietf um

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
we can publish ifcs but more important

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,360
our role

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,120
is to encourage collaborations uh

50
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,720
rather than think about standards

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,319
uh and i believe that's why we've been

52
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,400
doing quite well so far

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,440
so let's keep doing that

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,640
right uh so to start anything proper we

55
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,120
do need a minute taker so

56
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,519
that was a brief pause uh now that we

57
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,480
have 55 percent

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,319
does anybody want to volunteer to take

59
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,720
minutes

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
before before i behave like a professor

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
and actually appoint someone

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,000
there's a volunteer who says darren who

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
says he does not familiar with the

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,480
status of the draft so

65
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,080
if there's a better attendee then

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
so we'll give it a minute and if nobody

67
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,879
steps up well i think

68
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,959
jared is an excellent choice it's a good

69
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,480
opportunity for darren to get involved

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,120
in the day-to-day work of qirg

71
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
thank you for volunteering darren

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
let's give it a few more seconds

73
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,239
like uh wojciech said i don't i don't

74
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,599
think the the uh the

75
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,599
uh the note takers job is going going to

76
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
be terribly onerous today

77
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
in terms of the uh the total amount of

78
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
work that has to be done

79
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
capture the key points of the q a

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
and what what gets promised or or work

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,798
items that get handed out

82
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,680
in terms of the two drafts that have to

83
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,240
be

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,840
that were that are the primary point of

85
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
discussion

86
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
and then grab any key questions or

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,280
comments out of the

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,120
open discussion section and that's about

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
it

90
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,440
yeah and somebody just shared a link and

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,320
i think i think

92
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,520
we'll leave it we'll leave the minute

93
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
taking them to darren and sean

94
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,639
on the relevant link and then i guess we

95
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,440
can then start

96
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,840
all right

97
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
the blue sheets are now taken

98
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,440
automatically through meat echo

99
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,560
um so just fyi there's no blue sheets to

100
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
fill up

101
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,520
uh okay so let's start proper uh welcome

102
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
everybody to the qirg meeting

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
for the ietf 110 online

104
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
uh it's it's a nice it's like a decade

105
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
because the first the proposal for qrg

106
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
was at the iit oh actually was itf 101

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
not the 100. so it's not a decade 10 88

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
meetings yet

109
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
okay uh what's the agenda for today

110
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
uh five minutes just to get things

111
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,240
sorted

112
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,199
uh then we have two drafts which we're

113
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:35,759
going to go

114
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,160
update through uh i believe there's been

115
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,039
quite a few

116
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,720
significant changes for the use case

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,880
draft so i'm looking forward forward to

118
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,919
hearing from going on those

119
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,440
there were not as many updates for the

120
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
principal's draft

121
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
and hopefully we're nearing the end for

122
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
both

123
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,319
uh and we're also going to have a

124
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,479
discussion group around the paper that

125
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,160
rodney posted on the mailing list

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
uh about uh development or not for

127
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,240
quantum interconnects

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,479
uh so if somebody feels lost during the

129
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,479
draft discussion it might be a good

130
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,039
chance to catch up at least on the paper

131
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,000
uh

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
to participate in the discussion group

133
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,479
and then a bit of an open floor

134
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
uh we've got a few discussion points at

135
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
least i have one i want to suggest

136
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
the current document status is that

137
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
there's two

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,840
active drafts they're slowly

139
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,440
converging and there's three expired

140
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,000
drafts which

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
i include because every now and then

142
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,120
somebody asks about them

143
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
and well if somebody wants to they can

144
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
pick it up or do something

145
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:49,840
more interesting with them

146
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
i want to make one announcement uh so

147
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
one thing that rod and i agreed at some

148
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,599
point is that we'd also like to

149
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,639
emphasize the educational and aspect of

150
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,080
the qrg

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
and for that reason we will be running

152
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,720
some qrg seminars where we invite

153
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
a speaker to give a talk and

154
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
open the floor later to questions we'll

155
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
be organizing that between the actual

156
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
ietf face-to-face meetings to kind of

157
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,960
allow us to really just focus on that

158
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
one seminar

159
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
and the first one is happening actually

160
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,720
in two weeks time exactly two weeks time

161
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,520
uh with uh the speaker will be madi

162
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,280
namazi who's the chief science officer

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,080
of cunect

164
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,120
qneck is a startup uh out of stony brook

165
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,319
university

166
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,520
uh working on quantum repeaters uh

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,520
so especially they're they're looking

168
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
into miniaturization and they have

169
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,440
been thinking about various aspects

170
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,280
including merging with existing

171
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,479
infrastructure

172
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
so if that's something that's i believe

173
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,680
that would be interesting to everybody

174
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,080
in the qrg so

175
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
the announcement has been posted on the

176
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,360
mailing list and it's also registered as

177
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,960
a virtual interim so it's on the data

178
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
tracker

179
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,199
uh we plan to have roughly one every two

180
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,000
months or so

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,520
so if you have suggestions for a speaker

182
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,039
or you yourself believe you have

183
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:07,440
something

184
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
you would like to share with a qrg in a

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
longer seminar

186
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,240
do contact me and rod for that purpose

187
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,919
uh i think that's it for minutes

188
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,120
uh so the first agenda part was

189
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,160
we'll hand over to rod yes sorry one

190
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,560
thing

191
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,800
so while while you were running through

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,919
this intro stuff

193
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,679
uh kiriti uh joined the the cube briefly

194
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,640
i'm not sure if they want to say

195
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
something

196
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,559
is i have a meta comment at this point

197
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,320
yeah go ahead let's see how do i enable

198
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,360
you

199
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
um i'm enabled i think okay

200
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,320
can you hear me um yes so

201
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,760
yeah um um the one of the expired drafts

202
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,399
the one

203
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,240
on qrg

204
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,279
advent i think we called it it's

205
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,920
possibly going to come alive in the next

206
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,240
few months

207
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,519
i've just joined the

208
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,519
marquee the mid-atlantic research

209
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,080
quantum

210
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
internet or something like that um

211
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,800
as as an advisor and um if they feel

212
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,120
that that's something interesting

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
i would revive the draft

214
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,680
sounds great great looking good

215
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,719
yep great thank you

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
uh okay uh that case

217
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
let's hand over to chongang to give us

218
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,399
the

219
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,440
update on the internet use cases

220
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
let me stop sharing my screen and i'll

221
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,839
grant screen to

222
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
hello hi budget um can you see my screen

223
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,680
uh i can see your screen i can hear you

224
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
okay thank you

225
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,480
should i start yes go ahead

226
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
okay thank you um yeah good morning uh

227
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,519
or good afternoon uh depends where you

228
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,920
are uh so this document is about

229
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
the applications and the use cases for

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,440
the quantum internet

231
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,519
uh version zero four um

232
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,920
so first off uh i would like to give you

233
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
a quick uh recap

234
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,320
um on the previous versions of this

235
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,680
document

236
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,959
so uh this version zero uh it was

237
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,279
uh uploaded as a research school

238
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,000
document back

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
in nasa may uh and then after that

240
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,360
version 0 1 was presented in itf 108

241
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
and then based on the comments feedback

242
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,320
from itv108 we generated one

243
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
version zero two um and then after that

244
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,000
we versus zero three um presented in

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
nasa ietf meeting one online and based

246
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
on especially based on the

247
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
feedback from patrick and the music so

248
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,760
basically as you can see um

249
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,160
in the in the past this document has

250
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,800
been

251
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
improved a lot based on lots of good

252
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,079
comments

253
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,079
feedback and suggestions from the

254
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,680
priority team

255
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,279
so the latest version zero four

256
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,040
uh basically um trying to address the

257
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,760
comments

258
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,200
and feedback uh we received during last

259
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
ietf media online

260
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
and also uh some after meeting comments

261
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,160
um from avedo magic and

262
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,440
joey so that's kind of a quick recap

263
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
um as you can see uh it kind of the the

264
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,240
document kind of uh

265
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,279
keep a progression um

266
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,320
the major updates um in the

267
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,440
present version therefore uh

268
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,959
as you can see here the outline and the

269
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,000
whole document has not been changed um

270
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,880
so major changes the first we clarify

271
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
the

272
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
um control and the data plan

273
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,600
classification um

274
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,040
let's change uh to the section four two

275
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,200
three uh and then um major changes

276
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,240
uh you know just to the six and five um

277
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,279
in terms of three use cases so first to

278
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:33,839
the

279
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
uh qkd we call the secure communication

280
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,839
setup we added additional description

281
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,240
about the kokiti post processing based

282
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
on the comments

283
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,560
uh we also classified on the user

284
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
identity and the privacy

285
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,040
in cookie d this issue has been

286
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,760
discussed

287
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,200
in last meeting um uh so basically

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
we clarified cocades kind of just to

289
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
exchange security and not necessarily to

290
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,920
disclose the user identity or violate

291
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,440
any kind of user

292
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
privacy

293
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,240
and then for the section 5.2 uh secure

294
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,000
quantum computing with privacy

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
preservation

296
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
so we added quite a few description

297
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,800
about the

298
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,360
uh blind quantum computing uh and also

299
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
based on comments we changed the you the

300
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
use case diagram

301
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,000
before we have uh we have a use case

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
like the uh

303
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,639
use the um the amazon device but

304
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
this time we kind of make it simplified

305
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,680
a little bit and just

306
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,959
call it a home device could be a gateway

307
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,760
it wants to delegate the quantum

308
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,639
computer computing from the gateway

309
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,760
to some quantum comp

310
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,199
computers in the cloud for example

311
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,320
uh that changes to the 5.2 uh and then

312
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,839
the 5.3 distributed quantum computing

313
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,000
basically added more description because

314
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,279
in in general

315
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,760
distributed quantum computing could be

316
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,120
in two forms or

317
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,399
two types the first type is the quantum

318
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,600
assisted or quantitative distributed

319
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,760
computing which means sedio it is a

320
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
class it is a classic computing but

321
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,399
we use a quantum mechanism like the

322
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,279
entanglement

323
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,160
to improve the class of computing that's

324
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,000
one type the second type is

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,720
you know the quantum computers they are

326
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
distributed in different places

327
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,600
uh and then for this scenario uh

328
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
we call it signal type that's kind of

329
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,680
the focus uh in fact three

330
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,839
and then we based on that we added some

331
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,000
clarification

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,680
um yeah and and then um

333
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
because of those kind of updates uh we

334
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
we have really we have kind of adapted a

335
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,639
little bit more references

336
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,079
and some other reference has been

337
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,880
updated uh basically quite a few

338
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,560
different new references have been added

339
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,240
to the documents

340
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,160
um that's uh and then by the way they

341
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,360
all this kind of

342
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,720
major updates we um they have been

343
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,680
posted in the

344
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,199
in the mailing list um

345
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,199
and then i got a confirmation from the

346
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
um for from the people

347
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,000
who who made the uh the comments

348
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,279
um so for the next step uh

349
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
uh so we feel the um the version kind of

350
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,120
version 4

351
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
is stable now uh because it has uh

352
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
addressed

353
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,399
um the the discussion and comments

354
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,079
from last meeting and also after last

355
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,759
meeting and basically it

356
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,199
it has addressed all these kind of

357
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,440
comments um

358
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
so for the next step we were wondering

359
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
um

360
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,720
and our goal is to ask the team and

361
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
you know towards the um research group

362
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,759
last call

363
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,639
um because we we feel as i mentioned the

364
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,440
the comments

365
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
from the preparation has been um have

366
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
been addressed and

367
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,600
you know this document has been um

368
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,759
discussed quite a few times

369
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,959
in each past meetings

370
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,440
but of course the under any time moment

371
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,480
that we need to get

372
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
comments and feedback from the priority

373
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,120
team so we can

374
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,800
continue to improve the documents um

375
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,440
yeah um yeah that concludes my um

376
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
presentation today for this application

377
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,680
a use case document

378
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,000
i'm happy to take any question or

379
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
comments

380
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,959
hello thanks jungkook

381
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,800
i security's raising his hand

382
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,560
but i have to admit guilty oh no he's

383
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,119
got himself

384
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,240
hi can you hear me yes

385
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,680
okay i had a question on a distributed

386
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,480
computing

387
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,799
piece end of section 5

388
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,799
just before section 6. um

389
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
when when when you talk about two

390
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,640
channels there's a

391
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,480
quantum internet and then there's the

392
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,760
classical internet

393
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,199
this is figure four

394
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,319
is the intent of the classical internet

395
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,119
to

396
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,280
be able to set up things that the

397
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,520
compute the quantum computer needs or is

398
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,600
this completely a side channel

399
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,039
for any regular um

400
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,880
communication that's needed between the

401
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
two end computers

402
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,919
uh yes that's a good question um i guess

403
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,880
for this figure

404
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,360
the uh the goal is uh like you mentioned

405
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,799
i kind of

406
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,320
uh first go is to um you know

407
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,919
um to correlate uh this

408
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
quantum computer a and quantum computer

409
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,400
quantum computer b

410
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,679
in order to set up the system in label

411
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,039
and also the both computers

412
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,320
may exchange some you know the computing

413
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,080
computation results

414
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,799
that's kind of the major goal the uh but

415
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,480
of course the second goal is

416
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
if there is any need between two quantum

417
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,640
computers

418
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,280
for classic communications this

419
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,480
classical internet

420
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,039
providing the classical channels could

421
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,840
serve that

422
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,799
purpose as well

423
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,039
okay so so you know in a way the

424
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,760
classical

425
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,799
channel is a control plane for

426
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,039
the class the quantum computers to say

427
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,440
here's what i have uh here's my

428
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,200
capabilities

429
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,000
because in during the advent draft

430
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,520
we were thinking of a parallel classical

431
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,080
channel

432
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,200
over which you exchange properties of

433
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,880
your quantum system

434
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
and maybe initiate uh entanglement

435
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,679
uh or or or understand how to

436
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,400
distill the entanglement to a better uh

437
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,840
entanglement

438
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
stuff like that so you do that over the

439
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,559
classical channel so is

440
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,799
so that i mean figure 5 figure 4

441
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,120
is an instantiation of such a system or

442
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,440
or could be used as an instantiation of

443
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
such a system

444
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,400
uh i think yes i'm a mouse yes i think

445
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,600
it could be a

446
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,880
user for that purpose um but the uh you

447
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,080
know because this document

448
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
is kind of the use case application

449
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,880
we were trying not to touch too deep uh

450
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,559
on the uh technology um because

451
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,880
as you said the entire distribution

452
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
actually

453
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,520
at the chairs slide shows there is a

454
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
separate um um

455
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,000
you know documents talking about how to

456
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,960
do that

457
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,600
uh but here definitely uh this classic

458
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,240
intellect could be used for that purpose

459
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,280
um yeah

460
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,480
okay thanks um i see um uh

461
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,360
the id van meter qrd quantum connection

462
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,480
setup

463
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
maybe i have to go read that first and

464
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
understand better but

465
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,960
thank you yeah thank you thank you for a

466
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,520
good question

467
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,840
any other questions

468
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,960
uh i have a question um so i've

469
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
i've already raised this with you

470
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
briefly when we were doing our round of

471
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,000
feedback but i never really finalized

472
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,039
it kind of got distracted but so

473
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,400
in figure 5

474
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,400
you have the people who have the draft

475
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
open

476
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,400
i guess can open to figure 5. and

477
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
there's the outline of the six stages

478
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,799
uh and what i'm not clear about is a

479
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,320
difference between stage two

480
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,360
and stage three in the way you're

481
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
describing it in that figure

482
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,039
because the example in both cases is

483
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,158
secure communication

484
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,919
and then the characteristic for one of

485
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
them is long-distance cuban transmission

486
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,080
and for one of them is entanglement

487
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,360
now i understand all the words in

488
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,159
terminology used

489
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,840
i'm just a bit confused what's the real

490
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,559
distinguishing

491
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,679
factor here between stage two and h3

492
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,880
is this strict reference to this quantum

493
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,440
internet stages paper

494
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,039
uh yes logic symbols yes because uh

495
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,520
that paper uh described the stage two as

496
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,080
a prepared and then major networks

497
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,159
so these three is entitlement

498
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,679
distribution networks

499
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,679
so correspondingly we're trying to see

500
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,280
here um

501
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,360
the stage two the application could be

502
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
just a long distance

503
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,919
qubit transmission for the copd without

504
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:08,960
using any

505
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
kind of entanglement related

506
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,000
technologies but

507
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,159
these three because these three in that

508
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,679
paper they say internal distribution

509
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,880
networks which means

510
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,960
entitlement distribution is available

511
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,919
and now we could

512
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,039
use entanglement distribution based

513
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
non-distance cookie d that's kind of

514
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,559
ideal trying to

515
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,400
uh map the different versions of kokidi

516
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,200
to the stages described in that article

517
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,879
yes right so

518
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
so i i think everything from stage three

519
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,280
onwards is clear

520
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,640
so from entanglement distribution

521
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,840
onwards that i think that's that's

522
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
that's clear

523
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
but your described stage two is

524
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,520
entertained security without relying on

525
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,780
trusted nodes

526
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,200
[Music]

527
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,400
but is that actually stage two as

528
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:09,200
described in the paper

529
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,159
um because i i think i'd have to reread

530
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,280
that

531
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,120
status back paper i can double check

532
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,280
but i i think so but i i could talk to

533
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,240
you

534
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,320
so i'm not sure about that because in

535
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,520
general we're

536
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,559
the trend is to go to entanglement

537
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,520
distribution networks to

538
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,880
basically beat the distance limit uh

539
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,720
and the ability to transmit cubits long

540
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
distance without entanglement

541
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,440
distribution network

542
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,799
would require fault well some form of

543
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,360
forward error correction rodney knows

544
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,240
more about that than i do though

545
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,840
or yeah sorry

546
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,000
i i guess the major difference uh

547
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,200
between 62 and

548
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,640
33 is uh uh with

549
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,440
impactment or without empowerment maybe

550
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
uh actually

551
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,600
you know in this in stage two i

552
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
actually you know revised that sentence

553
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
end-to-end security without using

554
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,360
entanglement

555
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,840
uh instead of without relying on trusted

556
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
notes

557
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,679
i think that i think the issue i'm

558
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,600
having is with the distance

559
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,158
not the security uh

560
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
but there is also a security implication

561
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,159
so i'll tell you what like i can't

562
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,799
really

563
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,080
i don't know if we have time right now

564
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,400
to say more i'll read into that

565
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
stage two versus stage three but that's

566
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
of all the things in the draft that's

567
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
the only thing that

568
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,880
i've picked up on uh lately so

569
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,000
otherwise i i like the changes so far

570
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
and i'll let rodney say whatever he was

571
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,840
going to say okay

572
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
well i was just going to comment that

573
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,600
you know as

574
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,200
as valuable and important as stephanie's

575
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
road map document is that description of

576
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,320
the stages

577
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
it's it's written in in pretty pretty

578
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,640
terse technical terms in in the science

579
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,480
paper and so

580
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,679
having an interpretation of that that's

581
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,559
more accessible to people in the ietf

582
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,320
irtf community i think that's a really

583
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,080
valuable contribution

584
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,120
of this uh draft so i'm actually sort of

585
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,480
tempted to ask

586
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,320
for this to actually be this this

587
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,760
particular section of it to actually be

588
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,200
lengthened a little bit

589
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,480
because i think it's actually one of the

590
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,799
valuable things that it contributes

591
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,799
to sort of bridge those two communities

592
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,120
together

593
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,039
okay so um that's all that's a personal

594
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,559
comment based on the comment

595
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,480
on the content rather than your request

596
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,320
from the chair

597
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,919
um the i do think it's also

598
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
um i think

599
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,600
it is i think it i think my opinion is

600
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,640
the documents reached

601
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,240
read this to reach the stage where it's

602
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,880
ready for for a really hard critical

603
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,320
reading

604
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,919
from both experts and non-experts

605
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,760
to see you know that it's actually that

606
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,200
what's written is actually correct but

607
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,919
also that

608
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,919
also that it carries the message well to

609
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,279
people who are non-experts

610
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,320
so um when we're ready to say this is

611
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,480
ready for for uh for last call i think

612
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
it means we actually do need to have

613
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
the one round of pretty serious reading

614
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,000
on it

615
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,559
for everyone

616
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,240
was saying something yeah my naive and

617
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,320
introduction of stage two and stage

618
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,279
three is um stage two is one hop and

619
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,279
stage three is multi-hop

620
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,279
um using entanglement exchange so you

621
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,919
i mean to your point about distance if i

622
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,440
can't get there in one hop

623
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
um i might have to do something in the

624
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,799
middle and then

625
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,799
and then keep going i don't know if

626
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,799
quantum really works like that

627
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,760
but you know that's my naive reading of

628
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,960
it of this

629
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,200
yes uh yeah i i'm going to admit like

630
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,720
i'm in the field and i get confused

631
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,320
about the first few stages as well

632
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,480
sometimes

633
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,080
so it would be worth actually just like

634
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
really really

635
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,799
clarifying those uh stages

636
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,360
in this draft benefit there's a comment

637
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,080
from

638
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,760
the in the in the uh jabber chat

639
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,360
actually isn't stage two there to

640
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,000
accommodate

641
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
long distance by a quantum gate exchange

642
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,159
mechanism based on belt pairs

643
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,799
as i recall

644
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,679
and then followed up with them described

645
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,960
what i'm just thinking of

646
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,760
so so that would be entanglement based

647
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,799
yep

648
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,840
distribution yeah thanks

649
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,279
i would have to go back and look at the

650
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,360
exact definition of the paper to say for

651
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,240
certain but yeah

652
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,440
right uh well uh time's up uh

653
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,039
we can return to us in the open floor if

654
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
we don't have anything to discuss on the

655
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,279
open floor

656
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,399
um thanks john gang uh i think that the

657
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
way forward is to focus on these stages

658
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,640
and

659
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,679
really like make sure we're not

660
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,039
well basically there's some confusion

661
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,440
here going on it would be worth

662
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,760
clarifying

663
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,919
but otherwise i i kind of agree that

664
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,279
it's converging

665
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,559
slowly yeah uh so the one other final

666
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,240
comment that i wanted to make

667
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,480
for it and this is actually i think an

668
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,840
appropriate thing to say as

669
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,880
chair is that now that both documents

670
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,320
are getting close close to

671
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
what to final call on this um

672
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,279
personally since i've been much more

673
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,679
involved in uh why text document i have

674
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:40,960
a better understanding of that i'm

675
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,080
actually pretty comfortable with the

676
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,600
terminology that's in it

677
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,320
so one of the things we do when we read

678
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,679
a chong gang's for

679
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,120
final reading is to make sure that the

680
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,919
terminology meshes well with what's in

681
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,080
in the architectural principles document

682
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,919
right uh great and he's uh volunteered

683
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:00,480
to read the

684
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
the the uh use case draft as as a

685
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,320
non-expert

686
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,440
so good thanks awesome all right we do

687
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,480
need to move on

688
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,970
yeah rodney can you share the next uh

689
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,170
[Music]

690
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,880
on architectural principles for the

691
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
quantum internet and let's see it's 57

692
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,600
after right now by my time but this is

693
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,640
the other main

694
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,760
item on the agenda so um we said 10 to

695
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,679
15 minutes but if this one runs 20 i

696
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,720
think that's okay jim

697
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,320
uh i'd be careful because we still want

698
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
15 minutes for the discussion group you

699
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,080
you want to have so and we only have one

700
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,679
hour today yeah

701
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,039
well i do want to i do want to cover

702
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,240
that because i think people will get

703
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,440
something out of it

704
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,840
but uh but this uh this document's at

705
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,039
this stage where we're uh

706
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,559
i'll just get started rather than use it

707
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,640
one more time

708
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
uh i don't actually have much to update

709
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
because we've been slowly converging but

710
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,000
i'll start with a quick recap

711
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,399
uh first version was prepared for and

712
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,320
presented at ietf 104.

713
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,559
uh motivation is to address a charter

714
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,679
point

715
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,039
uh for an architectural framework

716
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,320
delineating network node roles

717
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,279
definitions

718
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,760
common vocabulary uh first step

719
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,960
important it's a first step

720
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,159
it's not an architecture itself and also

721
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,039
actually it serves as a good

722
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,559
introductory document to people without

723
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,360
a quantum physics background

724
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,320
uh in terms of practical stuff you can

725
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,919
find the latest version on github

726
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,000
i only upload a new draft version just

727
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,520
before the ietf meetings

728
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,279
it's just i find that just easier to

729
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,640
work with i always up

730
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,159
because github also gives you diffs

731
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,720
um so to the core what has changed

732
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
one of the main points outstanding

733
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,320
points was to align the use case draft

734
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,039
actually uses the control plane

735
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,279
terminology slightly used slightly

736
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,440
differently than

737
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,240
i originally did and the consensus was

738
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,990
actually that

739
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,440
[Music]

740
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,360
i was going to adapt the terminology

741
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,360
in the principles draft basically

742
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,760
the originally i wrote that the control

743
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
plane only manipulates classical data

744
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,440
but there are potentially some control

745
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
plane tasks where you want the control

746
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
plane to actually manipulate quantum

747
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,120
data

748
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,799
as well such as a quantum ping

749
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,039
for example uh but i did not make any

750
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,080
concrete boundary drawings etc

751
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,760
i because that's not the purpose of the

752
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,440
document and nobody wants to go

753
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,200
in that direction this document so it's

754
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,919
merely just opening the possibility

755
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,519
uh rodney also has sent a bunch of

756
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,220
feedback it's accounted for

757
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,080
[Music]

758
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,440
you raise some concerns if the document

759
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,640
is consistent with some uncommon

760
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,399
proposals for quantum

761
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
internet which includes a quantum

762
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,679
internet by

763
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,120
cargo ship uh

764
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
and well my stance is which i did show

765
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,039
in the mailing list is that

766
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,880
even if they're not 100 compatible i

767
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
don't think that's

768
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,159
an issue because we're not publishing a

769
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,720
standard um

770
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,760
and if there's an evolution or deviation

771
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,360
down the road from the principles i

772
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,559
think that's okay and it's just the

773
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,360
nature of

774
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,840
research

775
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,320
and i mean this is just a starting point

776
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,439
not the end point

777
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,159
and that that's actually it are we ready

778
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,600
uh there's as far as

779
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,360
my current to-do list for this draft is

780
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
actually just ordered the references and

781
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,919
otherwise

782
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
other than that i'd basically say

783
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,840
it's done and ready to go to the next

784
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
step

785
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,200
all right uh you wanted to you want to

786
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,159
step in and

787
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,360
comment here uh yeah in on the previous

788
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,000
slide

789
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,640
when white deck talked about not a

790
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
hundred percent consistent

791
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,000
um are you saying that the document

792
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,200
is not consistent with some or they

793
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,760
describe

794
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,120
some uncommon proposals because i would

795
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,000
like the

796
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,880
the terminology to be consistent

797
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,840
no no no no so this is more like looking

798
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,120
forward a i i

799
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,360
at the moment i i should have at the

800
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,399
moment i do not see anything

801
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,200
inconsistent

802
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,039
i myself and nobody has raised any

803
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,279
inconsistencies rodney just

804
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,640
mentioned that there's some uncommon

805
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,480
proposals which

806
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,010
somebody needs to have a closer look at

807
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,559
[Music]

808
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,519
at the moment i don't see anything

809
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,279
inconsistent ultimately either i had to

810
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,880
look at the cargo ship for example one

811
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,679
and

812
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,080
uh the quantum internet by cargo ship i

813
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,519
felt was

814
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,159
cons could it basically falls under all

815
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,399
the terminology we use

816
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,240
in the draft uh i did not

817
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,080
feel like i'd have to add anything to

818
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,919
make it align with the

819
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,480
cargo ship proposal for example there

820
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,840
was other concerns about the all

821
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,000
optical container features but i'm not

822
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,360
an expert on that so i cannot

823
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,159
talk about that

824
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,960
[Music]

825
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,119
yeah we're actually doing research on on

826
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,679
the on the all optical ones but but but

827
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,359
there's still various aspects of

828
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,960
actually using

829
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
the all optical ones that i haven't

830
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,800
fully wrapped my head around

831
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,159
how much it changes the network

832
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,040
architecture so

833
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,239
i can't i can't say what we've got

834
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,760
yeah and ultimately we don't propose a

835
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,599
network architecture in this

836
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,719
document so when i say

837
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,520
100 if somebody comes in the future and

838
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,960
says here's this brand new technology of

839
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,079
a quantum repeater that

840
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,599
we weren't fully we didn't fully

841
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,199
understand uh

842
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,719
today i mean today uh

843
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,960
i don't i think they're just that would

844
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
just require

845
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,719
new work rather than making sure we're

846
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,640
we account for every possibility that's

847
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,520
going to come our way in the future

848
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,079
yeah i i'm i'm i'm okay with that

849
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,119
but no at the moment i do not see

850
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,880
compatibility which is anything that

851
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,400
currently exists and i am aware of

852
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,280
okay we've got uh two questions in the

853
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,760
uh

854
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,839
chat here if we've covered that so if

855
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,359
you're if you think we're okay with that

856
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,520
i think i'm okay on that um

857
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
the uh robin's comment was if there's a

858
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,440
reference for

859
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,560
for cargo ship um the

860
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,079
i'll get you the reference i'm actually

861
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,599
one of the authors on that paper

862
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,119
the first author is simon the bit um

863
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,920
but the uh

864
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,720
joey salazar has a question here where

865
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,160
are these proposals

866
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,240
going um joey do you want to comment

867
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,760
further on and then i'm not quite sure

868
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,400
what the question

869
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,640
means

870
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,520
i understand that this is like looking

871
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,079
forward

872
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,760
into uh potential support

873
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,680
along the line but i was just wondering

874
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,400
like um

875
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,520
the purpose of that you already

876
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,359
mentioned like the cargo ship and that

877
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,079
and

878
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,160
yeah the cargo ship one like where are

879
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,920
those cripples of going

880
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,720
like are they being brought into court

881
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,079
here at the ipf

882
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,040
or somewhere else

883
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,760
oh at this point they're they're they're

884
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,000
pure research papers purely at the idea

885
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,119
level and so so the uh uh i

886
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,160
you know if you had asked me before the

887
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,800
chinese satellite was was uh

888
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,160
before the results of the chinese

889
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,000
satellite experiment were announced i

890
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,280
would have said that i thought the first

891
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,160
way

892
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,680
entanglement would actually be

893
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,599
distributed between two continents would

894
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,480
have been by literally carrying

895
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
error-corrected qubits from one location

896
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,000
to another but but the chinese

897
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,079
satellite experiment has been so so

898
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,800
amazing that um

899
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,000
satellites are actually looking a lot

900
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,119
better than i thought they would a few

901
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,200
years ago

902
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,960
all right so then we're talking about

903
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,680
potential oh i'm so sorry to interrupt

904
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,200
uh then we're talking about potential

905
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,359
proposals that might not come to queer

906
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,560
or the idf right

907
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,560
uh yeah there there are a long ways from

908
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,400
actually even experimental demonstration

909
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,920
let alone ready for anything

910
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,359
like standardization at all

911
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,440
that are closer to needing real

912
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,240
interoperability and real

913
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,640
real uh protocols that are well defined

914
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,240
with the kind of expertise we have here

915
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
you know the near term ones are really

916
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,119
metro area networks and over over a

917
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,400
distance of maybe

918
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,240
100 or so kilometers like the network

919
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,599
that's actually being developed in the

920
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,079
netherlands

921
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,720
but as laying out an architecture and or

922
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,800
at least even architectural principles

923
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,079
we want something that's going to

924
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,920
continue to work for us for as long as

925
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,560
we possibly can

926
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,320
uh i mean as has been printed out in

927
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,760
jabber it's it's but

928
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,440
there's a bit of analogy to make to ip

929
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
by alien carriers uh

930
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,079
which is that you know ip is so good

931
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,480
that

932
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
you know you can actually run it over

933
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,000
pigeons uh

934
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,200
so the idea is that if this

935
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,280
architectural principles is sufficiently

936
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,400
well scoped

937
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,160
it could also run maybe not over pigeons

938
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,599
but over cargo ship

939
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,040
at least all right there was another

940
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,839
question in the queue there from uh

941
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,640
alexander uh patricia

942
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,440
is quantum internet a quant a network of

943
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,520
quantum computers or is it a quantum

944
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,240
network of classical computers

945
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,759
um so

946
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,440
you're the author you want to answer

947
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,240
that one i'd say actually

948
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,440
originally i'd say quantum computers

949
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,520
uh but there is a bit of a caveat to

950
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,960
saying just going to computers yes in

951
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,560
principle in the future we want to enter

952
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,400
it's it's meant to be

953
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,839
a connection of quantum computers with

954
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,760
each other via quantum means so they can

955
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,400
exchange

956
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
qubits with each other rather than two

957
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,000
current computers connected by a

958
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,440
classical internet

959
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,400
that's the key distinct differentiator

960
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:58,640
as

961
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,680
we're not talking about two quantum

962
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,960
computers communicating classically

963
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,760
we're talking about

964
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,079
quantum computers communicating using

965
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,000
quantum

966
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,880
mechanics but in terms of classical

967
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,800
computers can be connected by quantum

968
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,240
internet um that one could actually call

969
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,880
it that because

970
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,680
for example uh qkd quantum key

971
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,320
distribution

972
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,760
does not actually need a very

973
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,839
sophisticated terminal

974
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,079
uh in fact you can actually build

975
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,839
quantum key distribution using just

976
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,040
a photon emitter which without a quantum

977
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,920
memory

978
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
uh and there are startups for example in

979
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,599
the uk who are building them

980
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,560
in a form factor of a pci card so

981
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,920
something that you can actually insert

982
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,640
into

983
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,119
a classical device but then you

984
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,240
obviously would need to connect it to

985
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,960
fiber but

986
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,119
the part remains it is actually a card

987
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,480
you could potentially insert there that

988
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,280
startup is cats

989
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,359
but if you wanted more details about why

990
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,960
we only need an emitter there's

991
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,400
if you look at the recording from the

992
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,800
previous ietf meeting there's a talk by

993
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,000
josh slater about mdi qkd word which is

994
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,280
actually built around the idea that you

995
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,560
only emit photons from the end points

996
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,240
so it could basically be just a pci card

997
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,319
you plug into your classical computer

998
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,079
but more sophisticated ones will require

999
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,599
quantum computers connected by quantum

1000
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,640
entanglements to each other

1001
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,560
yeah one of the one of the areas where

1002
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,720
where

1003
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,720
sorry go ahead who is that yeah yeah uh

1004
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,560
this is alexander petersburg uh

1005
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,640
thank you for the reply uh yes i will

1006
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
look at the recording that you

1007
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,160
indicated um

1008
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,079
and thank you for content that uh

1009
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,200
quantum minute would probably be both

1010
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,760
options that we discussed both a

1011
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,520
quantum communications computers but

1012
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,599
also maybe

1013
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,520
regular channel which has been found on

1014
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
computers

1015
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,960
the the data is about this

1016
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,119
network might have a particular

1017
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,280
quantum before this internet

1018
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,200
i don't know yeah okay i will

1019
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
i will look i will look at this in more

1020
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,640
detail

1021
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,359
to understand better here thank you for

1022
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,000
the explanation

1023
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,839
the one the one comment i would add to

1024
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,280
that is is that

1025
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,240
integrate so the quantum internet will

1026
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,800
provide

1027
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
a particular service it will provide

1028
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
end-to-end entanglement and how that

1029
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,280
gets used

1030
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,920
qkd is one of the applications but

1031
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,000
whatever service the quantum internet

1032
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,280
is providing will get integrated into a

1033
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,640
larger information system of some sort

1034
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,440
and the way most of us perceive that

1035
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,520
larger information system will be

1036
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,160
through some sort of classical service

1037
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
that's a wrapper around it at least

1038
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,839
and and even the quantum part may be

1039
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,359
just something small

1040
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,000
but the interfaces for how those the

1041
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,160
quantum services get integrated into the

1042
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,800
classical

1043
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,880
internet is one of those things where i

1044
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,400
guarantee you

1045
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,880
there is not enough work going on in the

1046
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,480
world on that topic

1047
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,960
and that's one one of the places we want

1048
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,640
to get to with qra rg

1049
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,800
is providing the work on on that

1050
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,560
particular topic so

1051
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,040
that's why that's why the expertise of

1052
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,240
this community matters

1053
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,200
in building these things

1054
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,520
uh yes and since we're almost out of

1055
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,160
time for this

1056
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,079
uh it seems that most feedback is

1057
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,440
actually questions

1058
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,319
now so does that mean we're ready for an

1059
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,890
rj last call

1060
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,100
[Music]

1061
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,000
my own opinion as as as a co-author of

1062
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,480
this

1063
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,920
is is that i think the document is

1064
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,359
really pretty much ready you know you

1065
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:45,760
know

1066
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,119
i would love to have uh sean turner and

1067
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,880
other people like that uh you know

1068
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,359
read it and give their feedback people

1069
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:54,160
who are

1070
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,440
who have written a number of rfcs to see

1071
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,000
whether or not

1072
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,079
they feel like it's at the right level

1073
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,359
now that we feel like the technical

1074
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:02,319
content

1075
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,000
is there does does it have sort of the

1076
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,839
right characteristics

1077
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,599
so so that it helps people in the right

1078
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,400
way um

1079
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,240
so as you're speaking more as a

1080
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,000
co-author i think

1081
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,160
so uh what what i'll do is rather than

1082
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,760
is i'll post it to the mailing list with

1083
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,160
a

1084
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
explicit suggestion please read so that

1085
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,640
before the next meeting

1086
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,400
uh we actually before even the next

1087
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,319
meeting we have already a question

1088
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,560
whether it's ready for last call so that

1089
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,160
hopefully the next meeting we don't

1090
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,440
it's getting finalized not

1091
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,839
well my opinion is this one this one is

1092
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,119
ready for us to say

1093
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,720
you know here at today's meeting it's

1094
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,640
ready for us to say

1095
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,640
last call you have two weeks or four

1096
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,560
weeks to read it and give comments and

1097
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,720
then after that we're going to push it

1098
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,319
to uh irsgene okay so what do we do

1099
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,040
we do do some kind of consensus voting

1100
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,599
or

1101
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:56,720
i don't think we need i don't think we

1102
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,920
need anything like that i think we just

1103
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,280
need to give everybody the opportunity

1104
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,680
to

1105
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,560
to to make their last uh their last yeah

1106
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
well posted a demand wisdom so we should

1107
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,240
we should pick a time frame you know two

1108
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,520
weeks or four weeks or something for

1109
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,720
people to give their final rounds of

1110
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,000
feedback and say

1111
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,640
you know on this on you unless there's

1112
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,400
anything critical that comes up as of

1113
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,520
this date

1114
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,599
this many weeks from now we plan to push

1115
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,040
it irsg for for their review

1116
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,800
uh yaakov points out that there is a

1117
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,400
show of hands tool if we want to use it

1118
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,599
that's actually a good idea

1119
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,480
let's see um i have not used the show of

1120
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,680
hands tool before

1121
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,280
as a chair so let's see how do we run

1122
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,520
that

1123
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,560
show of hands for people who um think

1124
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:38,960
this

1125
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,000
is ready to go to last call let's see

1126
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,440
show off hands tool start

1127
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,560
session there we go

1128
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,040
a new virtual hands session has started

1129
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,920
yeah there we go

1130
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,480
okay so people can actually raise their

1131
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:54,960
hand

1132
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,560
if they think it's um well let's see so

1133
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,040
sean

1134
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,520
sean said says uh the uh the question

1135
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,960
would be who will review in

1136
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,359
in the next four weeks uh i wanted to do

1137
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,599
first let's do the question of

1138
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,200
do you think this is real do you think

1139
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,240
this is ready for us to actually

1140
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,319
push it back out and make a last call

1141
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,480
for it my opinion is is that this

1142
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,119
that we're ready to ask for last call on

1143
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,560
the mailing list

1144
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,759
for within the working group um

1145
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,520
there's seven or so um

1146
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,880
well i was looking for the two you have

1147
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,680
to click in the top right corner

1148
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,680
yeah let's see

1149
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,160
so so far they're about uh oh eight

1150
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,960
people

1151
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,839
and let's see so um there there's raise

1152
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,920
hand and do not raise hand and so far we

1153
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,400
are at

1154
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,720
uh well we briefly had somebody who was

1155
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,920
that do not raise hand but

1156
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,160
but i guess they switched to raise in so

1157
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,200
if you think it's not ready for

1158
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,240
or um internal or

1159
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,640
research group last call click do not

1160
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,359
raise hand

1161
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,599
if you think it is ready click raise

1162
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,960
hand we've had uh

1163
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,720
somebody's toggle sort of back and forth

1164
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,959
there

1165
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,880
a couple of people are all right um

1166
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,040
sean and joey point out that last calls

1167
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,119
or last calls for reviews are usually

1168
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,640
two weeks

1169
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,319
um we've got one or two people

1170
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,440
who are who are who don't feel like it's

1171
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,640
quite ready for

1172
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,319
for uh last call yet um all right i'm

1173
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:32,880
going to

1174
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,400
i'm going to end this because this is

1175
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,319
just sort of an informal level of thing

1176
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,000
anyway here at this point

1177
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,839
um let's see

1178
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,960
right so if you think it's not yet ready

1179
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:45,599
for for

1180
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,599
for a working group last call that means

1181
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,280
it's incumbent on on you to tell us why

1182
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,960
so what is it that you think needs to be

1183
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,560
done before before you're ready to send

1184
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,079
it to send it around

1185
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,200
for our last review so once we do that i

1186
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,119
suggest we move that to the mailing list

1187
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,640
because we're now 15 minutes

1188
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,000
left so we won't actually have time for

1189
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,599
an open floor so i suggest we just move

1190
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,160
to the discussion group

1191
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,520
so i'll i'll say this we'll give you

1192
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,079
we'll give people uh 48 hours to say to

1193
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,160
say uh on the mailing list you know the

1194
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,359
people who stuck their hands up

1195
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,240
48 hours to to to post what your your

1196
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,440
major concerns are

1197
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,800
on on the qirg mailing list and

1198
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,040
in 48 hours if we haven't seen any any

1199
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,559
uh any major

1200
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:30,000
work that needs to be done for it we'll

1201
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
issue a two week class to call them from

1202
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,200
inside of the uh

1203
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,839
the rg

1204
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,680
okay sound reasonable

1205
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,240
all right let's see it's the last thing

1206
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,880
um there are a couple of comment

1207
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,440
comments

1208
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,319
coming in through the through the chat

1209
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:56,880
there

1210
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,880
let's take those either offline or to

1211
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,240
the mailing list or continue

1212
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,040
the discussion there in the uh group

1213
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,160
let's see

1214
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,720
oh that kind of

1215
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,139
[Music]

1216
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,960
so colin says it seems reasonable but he

1217
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,800
thinks two weeks is a little short but

1218
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,960
you know so you know that that's saying

1219
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,400
you know the two weeks would start

1220
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,079
basically friday for

1221
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,440
uh is what i'm suggesting more time as

1222
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,880
well or something

1223
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,640
yeah yeah it's not a major rush we just

1224
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:35,839
need a forcing function of some sort

1225
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,359
all right let's see

1226
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,800
somebody had a comment

1227
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,520
i was just saying go for it okay

1228
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,040
all right um last item on the agenda

1229
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,200
here we've got about 13 minutes

1230
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,720
left let's see

1231
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,520
how can i share that tab that opens in a

1232
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,800
separate tab

1233
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,800
uh well you have a share screen option

1234
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,319
in the top left but i don't know if you

1235
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:12,800
can

1236
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,119
choose a tab specifically so you open it

1237
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,200
in a new window

1238
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,160
yeah let me do that

1239
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,880
if your screen you really want to share

1240
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,880
your screen yes

1241
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,319
all right i only have one screen at the

1242
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,839
moment so we'll share the one screen i

1243
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:30,160
have

1244
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,598
um and

1245
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,119
let's see you should be seeing my screen

1246
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,480
there hopefully all right so folks um

1247
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,000
let's see when i'm in this mode i can't

1248
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
see you also so uh

1249
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,079
wojtek you'll have to drive and and keep

1250
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,599
me on track with time and whether or not

1251
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,520
there are any questions or anything

1252
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,960
um let's see so i posted on the mailing

1253
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,680
list

1254
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,720
oh a week or ten days ago a pointer to

1255
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,680
this recently published roadmap

1256
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,839
development of quantum interconnects

1257
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,440
quicks for for next generation

1258
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,680
information technology

1259
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,800
um this is a roadmap that came out

1260
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,200
of a 2019 um nsf workshop in the united

1261
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,319
states

1262
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,960
um so you know that list of that long

1263
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,160
list of authors

1264
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,200
there is um

1265
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,480
entirely u.s based authors and so

1266
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,400
of course they all have come from a

1267
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,079
collective particular collective point

1268
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:30,960
of view

1269
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,160
but it's also the case that

1270
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,200
the vast majority of them are physicists

1271
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:37,920
and so

1272
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,440
when i read this document

1273
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,680
the i think it does a really outstanding

1274
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,559
job

1275
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,720
at covering what the state of the

1276
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,760
components

1277
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,240
is um but even though

1278
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,000
par structurally within the document

1279
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,319
there's a section that talks about

1280
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:00,400
modular interconnects meaning how you

1281
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,440
can do

1282
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,200
essentially node to node communications

1283
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,599
for system area network to scale up

1284
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,359
uh processors and there's a section

1285
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,119
that's called quantum internet

1286
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,200
there's really what i think of uh you

1287
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,160
know for what

1288
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,319
for qirg purposes i think there's

1289
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,000
actually very little

1290
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,079
on what we would think of as networking

1291
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,359
for people in uh

1292
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,800
in this community um

1293
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,040
there are a there is a really valuable

1294
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,160
set of tables

1295
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,559
of milestones and technology that's the

1296
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,400
set of appendices

1297
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,839
um so if you are particularly interested

1298
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,520
i really encourage you to

1299
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,520
to take a look at the document in

1300
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,000
particular to go through the appendices

1301
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,440
um but i don't want to

1302
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,640
you know i'm not going to read you the

1303
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,400
document or anything what i wanted to do

1304
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,200
was to

1305
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,520
introduce the document very briefly and

1306
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,359
then give people a chance to ask

1307
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,520
questions on it or to to

1308
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,359
even to think out loud about how this

1309
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,200
could potentially

1310
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,880
influence what we're doing inside of a

1311
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,400
qirg so

1312
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,520
um comments questions

1313
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:19,839
complaints conservative criticisms

1314
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,559
um hi this is su tang speaking from

1315
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,480
huawei

1316
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,200
it is my first time to attend the qirg

1317
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,599
discussion and thank you very much for

1318
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,880
referencing the the paper i have a very

1319
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,119
uh high level question on this on this

1320
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:40,640
paper so

1321
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,520
the milestones highlighted in this from

1322
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,319
the

1323
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,800
from the american scholars and uh do you

1324
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,599
think this is

1325
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,079
pretty in line with uh with european

1326
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:50,880
vision

1327
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,079
and my feeling is that um i thought that

1328
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,359
european uh

1329
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:57,440
advances in quantum communication is a

1330
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,640
bit already a bit

1331
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,559
far a bit further than the milestones

1332
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,839
highlighting in the paper

1333
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,960
um what do you think

1334
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,000
that's a good question certainly some

1335
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
some of the very most advanced

1336
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,240
actual experimental work is is taking

1337
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,319
place in in europe

1338
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:24,079
in vienna and delft and and other places

1339
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,440
um i have not

1340
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,559
seen a detailed road map for

1341
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,440
com come out of uh any of the eu or even

1342
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,559
national projects in

1343
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,880
europe that says these are the goals

1344
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,079
we're planning on hitting

1345
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,319
other than you know delft say saying

1346
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,000
that that that they are planning

1347
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,960
to to hit um you know actual

1348
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,880
entanglement swapping and a metropolitan

1349
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,640
area network that that

1350
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,160
that meets sort of the dead minimum

1351
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,839
requirements for repeaters

1352
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,440
i think the original target for that was

1353
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,960
2020 but we all know what happened to

1354
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,400
2020 so

1355
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,680
um i have not seen a larger

1356
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,800
longer more detailed or your bigger

1357
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,440
vision

1358
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,440
roadmap come out of europe um wojtek

1359
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,640
have you seen anything like that do you

1360
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,598
have any comments on that

1361
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,319
um

1362
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,960
not really uh so uh there's different

1363
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,400
plans and road maps there's some that

1364
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,000
are qkd specific

1365
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,520
uh there's some that are non-qkd

1366
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,359
specific for quantum or feature specific

1367
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,319
ones then

1368
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:28,240
no qkd one might have to talk around a

1369
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,399
bit

1370
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,240
um so you know the this uh the appendix

1371
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,000
b that's that's on my screen here right

1372
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,400
now

1373
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,319
uh your timeline and milestones for

1374
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:39,599
modular processors

1375
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,520
and that appendix c time learn by

1376
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,200
timeline milestones for quantum

1377
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,119
internet um you know i have not seen an

1378
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,559
equivalent for this come out

1379
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,200
out of the eu but i think that i don't

1380
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,079
think the goal was

1381
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,960
was necessarily to say this is what the

1382
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,640
us will will achieve but

1383
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,400
more a matter of this is what we think

1384
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,079
is reasonable for the global community

1385
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:00,880
to achieve

1386
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,400
but of course it happens that the

1387
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,079
authors are all from an american point

1388
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:05,599
of view

1389
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,559
but you know for example this particular

1390
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,799
point right here

1391
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,040
on

1392
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,160
suggesting that in three years it might

1393
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,400
be possible to to create a photonic

1394
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,200
entanglement

1395
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,920
at you know 10 to the eighth per second

1396
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,559
you know that would be

1397
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,400
uh you know an astonishing number and so

1398
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,839
that would that has to be taken in

1399
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,760
particular context uh i would assume

1400
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,880
that that's actually

1401
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,480
talking about generating entangled

1402
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,000
photon pairs for example

1403
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,040
that's certainly not creating a complete

1404
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,960
quantum internet in any in any way shape

1405
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,359
or form

1406
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,640
so i'm not sure if that's a full answer

1407
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,319
to your question or not

1408
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,839
um i'm well to be frank i'm

1409
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:51,920
never either from my side but if i look

1410
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,240
at also these um

1411
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,400
the section b that you just presented on

1412
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,359
the on the screen

1413
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,119
and if i look at a number of repeater

1414
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:01,760
notes um

1415
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,799
the um section b um so the

1416
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,200
milestone for for quantum for quantum

1417
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,720
internet

1418
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,119
oh the appendix c here again yeah yeah

1419
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:11,920
appendix c

1420
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,599
yeah um great deals

1421
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,480
yeah right appendix c i'm sorry um so

1422
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,559
here if i see the number of repeater

1423
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,160
nodes that that to be

1424
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,520
our expected in three years here i see

1425
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,720
um three memory nodes um bigger than 10

1426
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,799
euter nodes

1427
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,799
so at least from the from the delved

1428
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,760
statement that i understand at least

1429
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,119
within 2020

1430
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,880
um three nodes would already be

1431
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,720
connected

1432
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,240
in in three dutch cities

1433
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,880
so that makes me speculate a little bit

1434
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:51,280
um

1435
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,760
if europe is is leading

1436
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,119
on the quantum communication networking

1437
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,760
um but perhaps it's not so it's not so

1438
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,520
so important as you just mentioned i

1439
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,200
mean this is a community it's a global

1440
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,319
community

1441
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,359
um it might be the vision but but the

1442
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,920
the actual technology advances might be

1443
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,960
already quite quite quite different than

1444
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,920
what people expect

1445
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,640
i don't remember how or even

1446
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,359
if they actually define user nodes there

1447
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,559
but those may be

1448
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,599
what in other contexts have been called

1449
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,799
um measurement nodes you know end nodes

1450
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:33,599
for that

1451
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,839
or i'm not sure that maybe clients that

1452
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,280
are actually

1453
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,559
that are actually accessing those

1454
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,240
services i'm not actually certain in

1455
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,440
this particular case so it's actually

1456
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,640
worth checking

1457
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,480
that's a good point i don't know off the

1458
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,160
top of my head the exact answer to what

1459
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,359
their definition is here

1460
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,240
um other questions or comments wojtek

1461
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,839
where we're 26 actor here

1462
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,000
yes so we need to wrap up but there's

1463
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,319
one more question from kiriti i see

1464
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,760
um like a media converter for cubits

1465
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,000
about the uh about this roadmap or about

1466
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,559
something else yeah about

1467
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,240
quick as described in this roadmap not

1468
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,520
the google protocol

1469
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,839
okay so the question is quick like a

1470
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:22,319
media converter for qubits

1471
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:24,720
is quick like a media converter for

1472
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,359
qubits

1473
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,680
uh in this context so so you know they

1474
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,720
titled this quantum

1475
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,920
interconnects but they really mean

1476
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,559
any sort of internode communication

1477
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,400
mechanism here

1478
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,799
so including both what i would call a

1479
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,079
system area network

1480
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,599
or other people would call like a

1481
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,680
supercomputing interconnect or something

1482
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,839
the interconnect for a scalable large

1483
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,119
number of nodes

1484
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,599
and also wide area networks so they're

1485
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,559
covering both

1486
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,680
in this in this road map

1487
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,079
but don't be misled by the term

1488
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,280
interconnects here that

1489
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,000
they're really referring to to to a

1490
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,599
broad range of networks

1491
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:02,799
although they don't really have sort of

1492
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,640
a lot of expertise they don't they don't

1493
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:04,960
in

1494
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,760
networks they don't talk about system

1495
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,599
area networks versus local area networks

1496
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,680
and metropolitan area networks and

1497
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,760
transcontinental networks and

1498
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,520
transoceanic networks

1499
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,799
and that's not covered in here um

1500
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,720
there there will be other road maps

1501
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,960
coming out i'm certain there there

1502
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,079
i've heard of multiple um road mapping

1503
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,200
efforts that are actually

1504
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,559
in place right now that are actually

1505
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,839
going on right now

1506
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,359
um the the idea of converting you know

1507
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,319
a quantum bit that is represented as

1508
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:48,960
spin of an

1509
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,839
electron to maybe a photon somewhere

1510
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,359
else or maybe

1511
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,480
i don't know those different types

1512
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,400
is what i meant by the media conversion

1513
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,280
is that in an important notion and quick

1514
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,400
in in the quantum interconnect that you

1515
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,640
can go

1516
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,319
sorry i missed that part uh different

1517
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,400
types meaning

1518
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,880
so you have a qubit here that's

1519
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,400
represented as a spin

1520
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,200
of an electron you have a qubit there or

1521
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,079
you need

1522
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,720
to to turn that into a qubit that's you

1523
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,119
know

1524
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,480
uh the phase of a photon and

1525
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,240
and so there's that kind of media media

1526
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,839
exchange or media interconnect uh that

1527
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:35,040
media conversion yeah that's a

1528
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,760
enhancement of uh entanglement of

1529
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,559
photons with stationary qubits

1530
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,960
stationary memory cube is is definitely

1531
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,400
one of the key

1532
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,400
pieces of technology that has to be done

1533
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,720
in uh in part of this

1534
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,839
um and that's been understood

1535
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,240
uh since since the the relatively early

1536
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,400
days of what are called the divan senzo

1537
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,520
criteria

1538
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,920
by uh david senza who was a researcher

1539
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,720
at ibm and is now a

1540
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,000
professor in europe somewhere

1541
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,680
yes uh i'm afraid we're gonna have to

1542
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,760
wrap up now we're less than one minute

1543
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,559
left

1544
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,359
um so any discussions continue please

1545
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,119
continue on the mailing list

1546
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,280
uh including the uh draft wrap-ups

1547
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,319
uh also on the mailing list so i think

1548
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:23,920
that's all for me rodney do you want to

1549
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,440
add anything before we

1550
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,640
shut down oh nope that's

1551
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,480
it thank you everybody thank you all for

1552
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,000
for uh being here there

1553
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,119
there are many other

1554
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,280
fun things going on so we'll uh we'll

1555
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,359
see you all on the mailing list

1556
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:44,079
and um barring any major objections come

1557
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,160
friday wojtek and i will uh we'll start

1558
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:46,880
a two week

1559
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,880
call at last call for for for the uh

1560
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,000
architecture draft and the use case one

1561
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,680
will be probably not very far behind

1562
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,880
that

1563
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,319
yeah and thanks darren and sean and

1564
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:01,759
robin for help during the meeting

1565
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,839
okay thanks everybody bye

1566
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,920
you
