00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,799
for minutes

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,920
still for a couple more hours at least

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,039
yeah they uh my my uh i should be

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,960
removed from all the mailing lists and

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,800
stuff by the end of the day

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
so my mail my my mail volume will go

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,840
down a lot

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
all right according to this it's time

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480

welcome everybody to the final day of

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the virtual meeting

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
it's saturday the 13th for me but it's

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
the 12th for everybody else

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,000
i think no one else has stayed up this

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,960
late here

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
um the extra session we have an hour

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,960
um by now i'm sure we have

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
all seen this note well very many times

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
and knows it very well

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
if you have any questions please ask

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,280
this is the agenda that i've put

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,520
together for an hour

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
does anyone have anything you want to

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,640
change

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,840
and remove to this list

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
i see a shortage of hands so

31
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
let us move straight on to i'm at four

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,840
which is alexi

33
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,320
hello alexi i can't hear you

34
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
hello can you hear me hello now i'm here

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,920
yeah um sort of on the previous slide

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
um i was looking through my notes for

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
109

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,560
and um i think i volunteered for the

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
cf action ayanna registration draft

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,080
yeah um so i haven't done anything until

41
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
today but i have some bare bone of

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,839
the document oh cool

43
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
awesome i have noted that in there um

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,040
and you're

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,519
on now while you and barry are on all

46
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
right for rev2

47
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,239
next slide

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,680
gorgeous um yeah this is just a reminder

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,080
for

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,000
the process that was followed minimize

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
changes for the clock

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
make life easier for clients and

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,480
minimize changes for the servers

54
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,840
from imap4f1 next slide

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,760
right there has been uh 10 revision the

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,640
revisions

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,399
since last meeting

58
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
a lot of them in response to isg reviews

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,400
and whatever

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
various other comments um i'm just

61
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
trying to summarize

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,440
things here for people who haven't been

63
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,959
paying attention

64
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,640
um one of the things that i realized

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
based on

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,280
isg review and slightly late in document

67
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,840
cycle

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
is that although the document mentioned

69
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
i'm a bias i'm a poverty ls port

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,440
it didn't

71
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,080
segregate requirements between clear

72
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,120
text and

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,159
until export like some capabilities only

74
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
apply on a export for example

75
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
um i think this has been done over

76
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,239
several revisions

77
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,200
um yeah sure sorry am i all clacky

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,480
yeah a bit i think i think i have

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,840
the wrong microphone in that case

80
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,680
uh there we go you should should have

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,799
the correct microphone now

82
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,960
i don't know uh yeah

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
go on i will meet myself all right um

84
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,040
next change um this is actually

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,479
i probably should have included this

86
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
search number uh

87
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,800
but there is a well-known issue with

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
some strategies implementations where

89
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,040
if um cleartext data

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,680
is pipelined in some cases it can be

91
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
interpreted as if

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,880
it was received on the tls

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,120
arguably this is a bug but the document

94
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
now describes in more details how to

95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,360
prevent this

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
so hopefully interop is going to be much

97
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
better in this area

98
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,919
um there was a bit a few changes

99
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,400
explaining a bit more how i'm up for f1

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,638
and f2 can coexist in the same port

101
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,720
um what it means you know which com

102
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
commands need to be issued um

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
to to the under 4f2 behavior

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,199
um then there was a long outstanding

105
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,080
item about

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,199
making body part and message sizes

107
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
um 63 bit

108
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,039
um so this was integrated finally

109
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,120
and then there was some cleanup of copy

110
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,360
and move move command requirements on

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,240
um that they don't create target

112
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
mailboxes by default

113
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,520
i think there are some servers in the

114
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,199
past

115
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,280
had a bug in this area and it was a

116
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,800
shoot

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
so this was tightened a little bit next

118
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,560
slide please

119
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
um daniel miguel

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,520
in sector review uh found out quite a

121
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,280
few things and one of them was

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
the list of tls 1.2 ciphers wasn't

123
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:30,880
actually

124
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,039
correct and didn't quite agree with uh

125
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,080
rfc 7525 recommendations so this was

126
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,560
fixed

127
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
um he suggested further changes

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
um i wasn't quite

129
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,919
comfortable doing them i'm not sure what

130
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,400
the right answer is

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,880
realistically i think in this case is

132
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,039
our map service and clients will just do

133
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,800
whatever the underlying library does

134
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
um so and many libraries support like

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,919
both tls 1.2 and 1.3 so they sort of

136
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,280
work out of the box in this

137
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,080
reasonable sense

138
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,318
but if people have an opinion

139
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
this there is probably still a chance to

140
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,599
tweak it

141
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,840
um and then there were quite a lot of

142
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,639
security

143
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,919
considerations actually so um article

144
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:30,960
branson and i

145
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
received the private email about enable

146
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:34,880
pointing out that

147
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
it was

148
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,160
marked as

149
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,720
allowed in a different state that it was

150
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,560
in the description so description didn't

151
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,720
mark i didn't match abn f

152
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,879
and the inter uh they also reported

153
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,759
various issues with

154
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,520
injections of various responses if tls

155
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,599
is not negotiated and how different

156
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:02,720
clients behave

157
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,840
clients and servers behave

158
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
so this was quite educational um

159
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,000
in particular they they had some tests

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,840
where

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
they were injecting list

162
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,240
responses before authentication and

163
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
clients were happily displaying

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,039
all the mailboxes received even

165
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,039
in even though the the user is still not

166
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,240
logged in

167
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,800
um there were two things which were

168
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
particularly troubling and there is

169
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,559
extensive text on this

170
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,640
uh one is um

171
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,839
researchers pointed out that pre-oauth

172
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
response co uh response actually

173
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,600
if it's returned then it will force the

174
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,720
client to bypass

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,399
rtls because it moves

176
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,399
um the client and the server to their

177
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,120
authenticated state and star tls is not

178
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,399
allowed in authenticated state

179
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
so unless the client insist until it's

180
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,519
being used so either

181
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
it has to be directly on i'm a passport

182
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,120
or the client discovers that it received

183
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
pre-auth and then say well

184
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
i'm not happy with them then i have to

185
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
disconnect

186
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,160
um this is rather

187
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,440
troubling um another

188
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
similar example was about alert response

189
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,959
codes

190
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
in particular not too big on outlook but

191
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,279
outlooks

192
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
does display alerts and it does

193
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,080
url highlighting linking

194
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
so if alert is sent with the url

195
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,320
so and you um this can be done before

196
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,519
star tls issued again then the client

197
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,279
user can be tricked to follow

198
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
url for example uh

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
you know your server has detected that

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,320
uh your client is out of or your os is

201
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,640
out of date please download this

202
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
service pack whatever and you know users

203
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,920
have been tricked by this

204
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,200
so again there is text saying before

205
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,839
start tls

206
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,040
ignore all alerts

207
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,360
i think it probably should you know so

208
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
unless you really know what you're doing

209
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,279
basically

210
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,160
uh any questions comments on this

211
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,920
yet again we're seeing what a bad idea

212
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,760
start tls is

213
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,399
uh connect the ssl port negotiate your

214
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
security layer first

215
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
there's so many so many things that have

216
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,839
been caused by this including clients

217
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,200
that will just send the credentials in

218
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,720
the plain text if the server

219
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,760
rejects the start tls attempt

220
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,440
this is this has been seen in the wild

221
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,959
very many times

222
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,800
yeah i mean um if people implement star

223
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,120
class properly

224
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
but it's i suppose it's easy to make

225
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,160
mistakes

226
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,120
um yeah

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,839
i suppose in the future we can consider

228
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,519
whether we want to duplicate

229
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,720
uh clear text port imap

230
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
and start tls altogether but

231
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,839
i think realistically at this point

232
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
we're probably not quite ready for this

233
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,839
yeah yeah certainly not for this

234
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,839
all right let's have a look at next

235
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,160
slide

236
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
yeah this was actually raised a week or

237
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
so ago i think

238
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
people are asking what is the meaning of

239
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
dot mime

240
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,440
for leave body part and like def code

241
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,320
and cyrus

242
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,360
give different results um i think

243
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
realistically we should say that

244
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,040
client should never ask for this because

245
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
it's not valid but so maybe

246
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,199
this is something that can be clarified

247
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,839
next slide

248
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
so yes the document is in rfc editor sq

249
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,320
um i've just got bare and i uh

250
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
received questions from mayana about

251
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
updating various registries and we also

252
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,079
found

253
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,920
various minor bugs like capability

254
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,760
response code wasn't actually registered

255
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,240
in the

256
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,040
in the response code registry um and it

257
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,680
wasn't

258
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,880
also wasn't marked as valid for a map

259
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,120
for 4f1

260
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,639
so um that was nice to fix um

261
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,320
at this point yeah i think we need

262
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,120
implementations

263
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,600
uh i suspect there there will be people

264
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
will be submitting bugs at some point

265
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,440
so maybe in a year or so depending how

266
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
many bugs and how soon people submit

267
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,959
yeah there's a concern that we'll wind

268
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:03,920
up in the same

269
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,760
kind of place that v card four wound up

270
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
which is that it exists and it's a

271
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
better spec than b card three but

272
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480
everyone's still using v card three

273
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,639
because of inertia

274
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,720
well yeah that in a way this is a

275
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,560
slightly different problem in a sense

276
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,240
that um

277
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,200
now it's a good time to organize

278
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
interrupts and try to promote it

279
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,160
yep

280
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,800
am i is my keyboard still lead no

281
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,760
great i guess it did switch then it it

282
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
threw up an error

283
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
um too many microphones or something

284
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,079
else i tried to switch but then it

285
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,320
seemed to work so

286
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
good i can type and talk

287
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,639
cool thanks alexi so i mean there's

288
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,079
nothing really for us to do here other

289
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,199
than be aware of

290
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,680
where we're up to rfc editor has it

291
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,959
do you need anything from this group

292
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,920
other than interop

293
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,560
no maybe we can

294
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
organize something for hackathon in

295
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,199
summer or something

296
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,519
cool all right well um

297
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,959
you're on for the next one as well

298
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,959
because next is

299
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:31,360
the quota extension

300
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,800
yes next slide please

301
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,839
yeah next slide

302
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
so um yeah i've done a quick revision

303
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,680
um sorry took me so long but i was

304
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,199
sort of tied up with the mf4 f2 itself

305
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
um so i did clarification saying that

306
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,800
this quarter can work with either i'm a

307
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
401

308
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,880
or f2 um

309
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,959
updated examples to use dot example

310
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
domain i think

311
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,880
it was cut and phase from mark crispin's

312
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
rfc so it was using wrong domain so my

313
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,160
uncle

314
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,959
clarifications

315
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,320
um added a small sentence saying

316
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,360
that um

317
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
personal quarter uh disclosing personal

318
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,000
quarters to anonymous users can disclose

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
um information about

320
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,199
status of various resources which is

321
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,319
probably not a great idea

322
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,240
and finally there was an issue with over

323
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,839
quota

324
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
space tag variant where tag was um

325
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,439
actually

326
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,240
um it required characters which cannot

327
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,839
be used in response code like

328
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,519
closing square brackets so i think

329
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,480
even though it would be nice to have it

330
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,279
um

331
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,079
i think consensus last time was that

332
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,639
just take it out and

333
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
i had explanatory text saying that in

334
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,639
some cases it can be ambiguous whether

335
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,480
it applies to the current mailbox or to

336
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
the target mailbox but

337
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
this is probably not going to be very

338
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,279
common both because of

339
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,440
situation is going to be rare as well as

340
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
the soft quarters are probably not very

341
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
likely to be used

342
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,319
in general

343
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,519
and i think with that it's ready for

344
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,240
working group lascal uh it's been in a

345
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,440
working group last call

346
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
and the only comments were about there

347
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
over quota so i don't know if we need to

348
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,240
do another last call

349
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
fine does anyone else you think think

350
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,839
that we need to do a last call or should

351
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,480
i just ship it

352
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,000
give people a couple of seconds to hop

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,439
in the queue if you if you have any

354
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,319
comments

355
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,919
about needing another working group last

356
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,160
call

357
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,160
they're probably all asleep all right um

358
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,720
okay so murray will be getting the

359
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,079
shepherding report very soon then

360
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,039
awesome hello

361
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,360
um murray up back in these slides

362
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,440
it's me sip mailbox um

363
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
it's had it's basically ready to go um

364
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,880
but one issue that came up was that

365
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
there was some abnf in the document um

366
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,480
and i removed it in the revision 07

367
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,840
which is the current one based on the

368
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,720
reviews

369
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,480
um but there's questions about should it

370
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
be added back uh

371
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
i'm leaning towards there being no point

372
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,919
based on this

373
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,320
i reviewed a bunch of all the civ

374
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,240
extensions that exist and only a couple

375
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
of them have any grammar most of them

376
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
don't have any grammar at all

377
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,799
and all those that do have grammar they

378
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,320
don't specify everything in there they

379
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
just specify little bits

380
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,200
ken

381
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
two points on this i agree that there's

382
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,520
no point in putting the abn f back in

383
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
for the majority of stuff but i did note

384
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,440
on the

385
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,200
mailing list that the extension to fcc

386
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
as you wrote the abn f there is

387
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
incorrect

388
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,840
it needs to be the fcc-ops

389
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,919
token is what's being expanded not not

390
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,559
the entire thing

391
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,760
which is um this slide this is what i

392
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,000
removed so it's fcc opt that needed to

393
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,400
be

394
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
extended yeah

395
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
cool

396
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
uh does anyone have any strong opinions

397
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,160
about that it should be added back in or

398
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,600
should we just say let's leave it how it

399
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,280
is

400
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,640
i have weak preference for having

401
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,440
a dnf or ebnf like things to be honest

402
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,600
but

403
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
it did clear otherwise i don't

404
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,480
don't mind it it's certainly incomplete

405
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,120
if it does

406
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,960
add to these um what are the productions

407
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
what are they called from the original

408
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,880
sieve spec there are many specs that

409
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,480
have added to them but have not done the

410
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,559
abnf so that there's no one place that

411
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,160
you can collect the full formal syntax

412
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,039
that you need anyway

413
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,160
murray um i also have a weak preference

414
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
for having it just because

415
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
you know a specification should be

416
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,640
formal but um i

417
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,840
i mean i'm not gonna die on this hill

418
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,039
so the issue with the abn f in general

419
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,360
is

420
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,080
the base sieve spec was not written in

421
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
such a way

422
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,720
where new tests and actions can be

423
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,799
easily added to the grammar

424
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,760
the grammars there are basically to say

425
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,440
that a test is

426
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,600
i think it's an identifier or token or

427
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,640
something and same thing with the

428
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,039
actions

429
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,360
and there's there's no way to easily add

430
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,400
them in fact

431
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,720
the base spec itself doesn't even add

432
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,039
file into and discard and all the the

433
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,600
the normal actions and tests to the

434
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,120
grammar themselves

435
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
it just specifies it you here's how you

436
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,960
use the thing

437
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,440
but they are grammatically correct per

438
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,400
the abnf

439
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
is essentially what's going on there's a

440
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:48,159
little bit of hand waving going on

441
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,080
so my point being i'm not sure how to

442
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,840
correctly add

443
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,559
the new test and the new in this case

444
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,840
tagged argument

445
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,199
to the existing ibnf

446
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,440
i'll have to add as somebody who's

447
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,640
written some

448
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
civ stuff that uh when i wrote my

449
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
documents i found it hard to do the

450
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,039
abnf correctly and found it odd

451
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,000
how we were having to do it so i have

452
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,720
mixed feelings

453
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,520
but i'm leaning toward leaving it out

454
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,880
many of those in the no grammar

455
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,039
section had barriers one of the authors

456
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,000
so

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
um i i can see that you've run into that

458
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,480
issue

459
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,120
all right murray i think let's just talk

460
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,480
we don't need to bother with the key

461
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,799
okay all right so just i think just to

462
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,960
be clear my interpretation of the

463
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,799
what's left of the isg review is not

464
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,240
that you need to add this back but

465
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,840
more like are you sure you meant to

466
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
remove it so um yeah yeah totally

467
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,440
that's that's what we're trying to work

468
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,600
out here is is

469
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
is it worth making it to try and add it

470
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,640
back in

471
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,240
and it would be good when we have the

472
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,559
resolution to reply to francesca's

473
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,440
um ballot and uh say that oh yeah so

474
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,240
tell her what the solution for

475
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,200
yep i would like to actually separate

476
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
two issues

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
one is um having a bnf for new pieces of

478
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
grammar

479
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,559
and the other one is for linking it to

480
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,000
existing one i think

481
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,919
the the latter what ken was talking

482
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,280
about

483
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,600
a and barry was is probably less

484
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,559
important than

485
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,440
describing grammar for the pieces you

486
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,600
specify in the document

487
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,080
yeah maybe when you say it's a test or

488
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,159
action people usually sort of can figure

489
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
out if they know the basic spec

490
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,200
where you know where to plug it into the

491
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,679
parser right 8580

492
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,559
fcc is the one do we want tools or

493
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,600
whatever

494
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,240
um the one that's probably interesting

495
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,640
because

496
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,960
it collects together some abnf that we

497
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,080
can work from

498
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,360
so in that case extending fcc ops may be

499
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,440
worth

500
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,559
doing but not bothering with the rest

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,200
all right i'm happy to do that i can

502
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,200
put an extension to fcc ops

503
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,559
and and and i'll just put it back in

504
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,840
the document where the correct part is

505
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,960
uh this one sorry

506
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,880
yep so basically i won't bother

507
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
extending test and tag

508
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
because they are incompletely specified

509
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,000
anyway

510
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,840
and that's not really the right way but

511
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,600
i'll change fcc to be fcc

512
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,279
ops and i'll put it in the correct place

513
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
you may also want to add a comment and

514
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,520
that's that part of the grammar that

515
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,440
it cannot be used alongside a special

516
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
special use yep

517
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,240
that includes for yep for the um

518
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,520
fcc as well actually can it no it can be

519
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,039
used for fcc it's create that it can't

520
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,679
be used for

521
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,240
no i thought we'd determine that species

522
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
and mailbox idea mutually exclusive

523
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,720
i'll double check all right um yeah

524
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
whatever whatever the rest says i'll

525
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,240
align this with it

526
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
if if not then the civ's new spec is

527
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,279
going to be incorrect

528
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
yep no i think you're right thinking

529
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,799
back over it that was that was the

530
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,240
issue cool all right um

531
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,520
i think i have everything i need to go

532
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,919
on with i will issue a new version of

533
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,960
the draft with

534
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
fcc opts and with a note to say

535
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,679
cannot be used with special use

536
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,960
which then leaves leads us to

537
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,120
see snooze ken you're up

538
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,918
i am up okay uh next slide please

539
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,400
so there weren't a bunch of changes um

540
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,880
in the

541
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,200
most recent draft basically i just

542
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,960
implemented what we had discussed at 109

543
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
so as just recently discussed this this

544
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,159
allows both mailbox id and special use

545
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,520
to be used in the same snooze action

546
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,640
because we determined

547
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,840
last time that they are mutually

548
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,240
exclusive in one another

549
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,799
i also stipulated that the snooze action

550
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,480
cancels implicit keep

551
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,520
under the uh the logic that

552
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,120
snoozes is very similar to file into

553
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,480
um and it should have the same

554
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
distribution

555
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,080
disposition as 512 does

556
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,120
uh i also remove the text

557
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
about how this could be implemented

558
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
using um

559
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,440
future delivery smtp future delivery for

560
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,559
our discussions

561
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,120
and specify that implementations have to

562
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,000
use a special

563
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
snooze mailbox this probably needs more

564
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,919
text

565
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
and i would welcome any contributions in

566
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
that area

567
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,559
as also discussed i added a registration

568
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,360
for this

569
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,320
new special use attribute to that

570
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,080
registry which i think barry created in

571
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
one of his drafts

572
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,159
and finally added an example as

573
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:18,799
requested

574
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,480
of manipulating imac tags both at snooze

575
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,840
time and awaken time

576
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,360
those are the only changes so far

577
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,919
next slide i guess if there's anything

578
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,039
else that people have

579
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,840
in terms of additions changes questions

580
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
bugs

581
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,720
what's there is what we're running in

582
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,200
production isn't it

583
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,279
yes is there any differences between the

584
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,039
spec and what's live now

585
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,000
i think the only spec might be the

586
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,880
mailbox

587
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,520
id plus special use tags i'm not sure if

588
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,400
those are prohibited yet

589
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,919
cool i was kind of hoping ned would be

590
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,679
here because ned had a lot of feedback

591
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,960
in 109.

592
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,760
i was hoping he may have read this and

593
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,039
had some updates but

594
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,960
i guess we can take take it to the list

595
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,159
and

596
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:21,279
probe for more feedback there

597
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,799
all right if there are if there aren't

598
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,960
any if there's no remaining issues

599
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,039
and people feel that the existing text

600
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,640
around implementation guidance is

601
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,919
sufficient then

602
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,640
we may be ready for the last call

603
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,320
it feels to me like issuing a working

604
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,039
group last call and

605
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,440
seeing uh if anything pops up

606
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,159
fair enough it's probably right

607
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
any any further feedback on that anyone

608
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,399
want to comment

609
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,480
there's at least a couple of people in

610
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,720
here who haven't said anything

611
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,200
i've read the earlier version and uh i'm

612
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,919
very happy

613
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,600
for good working group what's called so

614
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,799
i can just double check

615
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,919
cool all right if stuff comes up and

616
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,120
working group last call we still have to

617
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,480
deal with it so

618
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,000
it doesn't change much other than us

619
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
thinking we're nearly there

620
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,440
excellent cool thank you

621
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,880
well based on that if we go back to

622
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,520
these slides we get to oh yeah milestone

623
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,760
review but let's do this first

624
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,720
we have civ eai which expired over a

625
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,760
year ago now

626
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
a year ago and we've had the sieve

627
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,840
actions registry which

628
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,480
hopefully alexia will do soon and that i

629
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
imagine we'll go almost directly to

630
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,760
working group last call because

631
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
the only question will be is it

632
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,520
comprehensive enough really

633
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,120
has it has it captured everything that

634
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,440
exists

635
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,720
um what do we do after that

636
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,600
with this working group is there any new

637
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,039
work that anyone wants to bring here

638
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,399
cannot think of anything um i probably

639
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,480
can have a look at cvi in a couple of

640
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,320
months

641
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,840
so um now that i actually i'm slightly

642
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,039
freer

643
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
with my other documents and the only

644
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,399
other thing um

645
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,440
if i'm a 4f2 is to be revised it would

646
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
be nice just to have a

647
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
working group in a dormant state for a

648
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,520
bit right

649
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,960
yeah and adding and for for murray's

650
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,520
consumption when when we chartered extra

651
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,919
the intent was to have it stick around

652
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,919
as a dormant working group when its work

653
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,039
was finished

654
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,520
to pick up other email related things

655
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,640
that crop up because they do quite often

656
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,799
so probably the best thing to do is when

657
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,679
we are

658
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,200
when we're dormant we stay dormant

659
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,159
rather than being closed

660
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,559
quick point on alexis actions registry

661
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:05,440
document

662
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,320
i assume we'd want to hold up snooze for

663
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,600
that to be produced and then they would

664
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,720
go together as a

665
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,440
as a group or whatever the terminology

666
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,399
is there

667
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,440
um i don't think you have to

668
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,880
i mean realistically if you years ago

669
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,919
in first then mine has to just include

670
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,760
snooze in the list right or

671
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,080
true yeah okay a good point oh we'll

672
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,679
figure it out you know i i don't think

673
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,000
it matters

674
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,279
obviously uh i encourage you to read my

675
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,080
my draft once i publish it yeah

676
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,559
absolutely

677
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,399
excellent well this is the milestones we

678
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,520
have

679
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,200
um cbao is going to be submitted

680
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,640
now but nothing's happened on in the

681
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,559
past year so

682
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,080
um and update charter i don't know if we

683
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,519
need to

684
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,919
recharter um

685
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
decided we don't need to reach out a

686
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,720
firm manage sieve

687
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,159
obviously we have extended suit but that

688
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,039
was within charter

689
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,600
there's i don't think there's any need

690
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,960
to change our charter

691
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,039
unless we were bringing additional work

692
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,399
here

693
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,279
um were there plans

694
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,039
were there plans to update managed is

695
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,960
that why that's in the charter no

696
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,240
it was just uh if it's gonna happen then

697
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
then you're gonna have to come back and

698
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,640
and recharter it was basically a

699
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
we want this to we want to have to pay

700
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
attention to this if you're gonna fiddle

701
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,159
with manchester i think

702
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,600
that understood i wasn't involved in

703
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,600
that discussion but yeah i think it was

704
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,279
more speculative just in case

705
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,840
if somebody wants to uh update it then

706
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,279
we'll do it here

707
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,480
if somebody wants to update it we'll

708
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
push him we'll push him towards gmab

709
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,960
said instead

710
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,519
well that's another thing that sort of

711
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,159
makes it

712
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,200
um now overtaken by events a little bit

713
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,480
but also as an email core co-chair uh

714
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,360
i think well all smtp and email format

715
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,320
and mime is likely to go to ml core

716
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,919
everything else is going to end up here

717
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,159
right

718
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,240
yeah not talking about dickie mandy mark

719
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,960
but

720
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,799
yeah yeah

721
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,240
yeah there's there's enough other bits

722
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,480
and pieces going on aren't there

723
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,000
but anyway um so submit quota april 2020

724
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,120
submit um

725
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,279
i don't know why see

726
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,960
if snooze is not on there oh yeah adopt

727
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,480
was done but it hadn't set one for

728
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
submit but submit civ snooze is probably

729
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,840
the same

730
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,159
and sieve actions registry

731
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,559
looking to what adopt in april submit in

732
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,279
in july

733
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,960
yeah i suspect you'll probably need uh

734
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,200
at least one division just to make sure

735
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,039
like um yeah if i missed anything

736
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,880
depending on what we want in the table

737
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,480
what kind of information so that would

738
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,279
be useful to

739
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,960
have a look yep that that gives us

740
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,640
time to re well i'll say submit august

741
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,399
and that that means that we'll probably

742
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,840
do the working group last call after

743
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,559
next atf

744
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,360
um but i imagine we won't probably want

745
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,919
to meet

746
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,080
at next atf unless there's a lot to

747
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,240
discuss there because it's

748
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,080
this one hour we have used half of and

749
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,600
we're already done basically

750
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,000
i would be very very happy if you uh

751
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,480
last call the document before the next

752
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
atf and then we'll just

753
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,320
do it on the mailing list so that's fine

754
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,679
cool i'll say july then

755
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,000
and yeah cbi eai wasn't yours originally

756
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,800
alexi but

757
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,320
if you wanted to take it on obviously

758
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,159
that would be fine

759
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,359
um do you think there's demand for it

760
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:35,040
um well i think implementations will

761
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
slowly need to be updated for this

762
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,239
so i think uh just having a look at

763
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,760
what's in the draft i haven't looked at

764
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,079
it yet

765
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,359
and see how much work it is yeah

766
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,800
let's say i'll look at it with you um

767
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,440
my sense is that because the uptake of

768
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,000
eai has been so low

769
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,839
it's unlikely that anyone would

770
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,839
implement it so it's a question of

771
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,440
whether we want the suite to be complete

772
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,599
for form's sake or whether we really

773
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,960
think anybody cares about

774
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,040
us

775
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,599
yeah it's like i guess yeah

776
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,960
because to update it then we can do it

777
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
but if it's going to be a lot of work

778
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,640
then uh it's probably not worth it

779
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,480
yeah let's have a look and just to see

780
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,720
how much work it is

781
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,360
we'll talk later

782
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,280
[Music]

783
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,560
cool and actually this text but

784
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,320
the table of content works very well

785
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
with civ action registry because

786
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,000
you actually need to go through all the

787
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,640
extensions and and verify that

788
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,480
whether there is any impact or not right

789
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,320
yeah yeah cool all right

790
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
yeah it looks like it's a fairly stub of

791
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,680
a document at the moment so

792
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,359
all right that at this point i have

793
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,240
nothing else

794
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,040
um that's been given to me does anyone

795
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,320
have anything else you want to discuss

796
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,280
or should we get our

797
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,400
24 minutes back

798
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,280
go socialize and get the town maybe

799
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,480
or not sure i'll well i've got to finish

800
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,400
my bsl socialize for a few minutes

801
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,880
and i'll go to bed i think i'm skipping

802
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,359
the last one

803
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,400
all right thank you everybody um

804
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,280
probably won't

805
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,960
see you in an extra meeting for a while

806
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,320
at this stage it looks like we we're

807
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
going to just finish off these documents

808
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,640
and then

809
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,000
then go quiet so thank you for

810
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,839
hanging around with us for the past few

811
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,720
years

812
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,599
okay bye everybody yeah really really

we have produced a lot of documents all

815
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
together

816
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,839
okay might well slowly loads documents

817
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,640
