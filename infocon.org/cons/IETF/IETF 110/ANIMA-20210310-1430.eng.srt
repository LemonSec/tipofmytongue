1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,520
77

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,840
it also shows the small page

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,360
on your right side yeah it's getting

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,640
bigger at a 88

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
but still not full screen

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,199
i believe you should there is wonderful

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,840
on the top besides the

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600
percentage right

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
i can't even see it in full screen here

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,840
this is

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,039
the second right button i

12
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,680
this looks like full screen button there

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,239
i'm not sure

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
next one yeah

15
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,440
no i mean it's still

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,280
oh i'm telling you that's good enough i

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,560
think

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,920
this time we should start yeah

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
like this okay um

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,960
welcome everybody um if you didn't want

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,280
to go to the anima working group meeting

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,200
uh then you're in the wrong place

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,680
because this is it and

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,439
these are the chair slides so let's see

25
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,600
everything is in order i hope

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
um right let me get started

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
with the itf note well um hope you're

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,640
all aware of that i'll let that linger

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
on for for a second

30
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
um and we don't need to

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,839
repeat all of it

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,440
so um joanna is going to take the notes

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,360
i'm not sure if we have a jabra scribe

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
so anybody who

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,800
can get on jabber and uh answer

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,680
questions there

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,920
um if if somebody only has access to

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,760
jabra would be highly welcome

39
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
slides and streams obviously everybody

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,280
who's on it

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,560
here knows it so no problem

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
so let me already go to you know our

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,400
work

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,280
so what we have is uh primarily uh the

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,480
big cluster of the

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
charter round one documents on their way

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,680
out uh

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,720
something like 600 pages there has been

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
um no

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,599
change um in the main documents since

51
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,440
then so they've been lingering uh

52
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,080
waiting for rfc editor to get to them

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
um michael is going to give a

54
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,720
short update on that as as one of the

55
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,280
slots

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
um and i think the only stuff that was

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
added since

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
last time i was going through all the

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,159
document is the um

60
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,040
grasp ap draft and that joined the rfc

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
editor queue after the last itf

62
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,319
um and so we're in before getting

63
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,360
towards auth

64
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
48 so then we have right now five more

65
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,640
working group crafts we've got

66
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
the asa guidelines uh which was adopted

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
directly before itf-109

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
um i gave the shepherd review but we

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,159
didn't have a slot at 109

70
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,000
so that slot uh with the update is now

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
here um we've got the brewski

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,239
asynchronous enrollment

73
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,760
which the author has updated since 109

74
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
we've got the constrained joint proxy

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,480
which was adopted after itf-109

76
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,879
we've got the constrained voucher that

77
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,360
was updated and grass distribution so on

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,080
all the

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
five working group documents we have

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
had activities and are reporting on this

81
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,040
from the authors so that's great

82
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,879
and that seems to also have resulted in

83
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,879
most everybody contributing focusing on

84
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,320
this and because on the

85
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,798
non-working group drafts there was a in

86
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,440
the last

87
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,880
um in the last period a little activity

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,680
we had

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
some discussion about thinking about

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
enema to make it l2 friendly and

91
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,720
resilience we're not going to have

92
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,240
something about this now

93
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
i was thinking about talking about it

94
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
but we i think we're also running out of

95
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,040
time

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,520
for the one hour um and the only other

97
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,080
update

98
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
on non-working group draft is the

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,560
jose voucher from michael

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,160
and then there is a long list of

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
non-working group drafts which i hope

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
will be able to revive

103
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
once the authors of the working group

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
drafts i think have more cycles left for

105
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,758
them

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,400
so logistics for the brewski related

107
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,520
work in

108
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,880
anima as well as also adjacent drafts

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
and other working groups there

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,880
is a design team which is open of course

111
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,840
to everybody um interested in it

112
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,639
and that happens weekly um michael sent

113
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,199
out

114
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,880
the logistics to the mailing list to

115
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
remind people um that seems to be uh

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
uh fairly active unfortunately for

117
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
california time it's

118
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,960
not very friendly but um uh most folks

119
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,000
seem to be from

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
europe anyhow so if you're um interested

121
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,039
in brewski uh and wanted to help

122
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,280
further with that area as well maybe

123
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
that's a good way to touch base with the

124
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,560
active community there

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,759
tooling reminder we've got a git

126
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,120
where if you are interested in using git

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,319
hub to manage your working group or

128
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,840
non-working group

129
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,319
document or software related to nmr

130
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
you're more than welcome

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
to use that github so that slide hasn't

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
changed so just in case

133
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,960
you are joining new to the effort um

134
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,639
that information here just pick it up

135
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,400
from these slides

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,240
and so finally we get to the agenda

137
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
and i think the next one up is

138
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,199
michael uh with any more details to the

139
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,680

[Music]

158
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,840
oh darn

159
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,680
this was working in the past

160
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
the screen has been shared okay

161
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,479
okay so uh all of these documents are

162
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,120
currently

163
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,240
in the rfc editor queue

164
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,280
um so um this is not a mistake the first

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,160
one on the left

166
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,840
grasp has been there since 2017.

167
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,800
coming up on its fourth anniversary and

168
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,039
i hope we won't celebrate that

169
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,240
um and um and then

170
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,440
this document here entered the this

171
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,160
cluster

172
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,520
because it references the other

173
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,599
documents um

174
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,160
in january after we did our working

175
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
group last call and the isg reviewed it

176
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,240
etc

177
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,280
so this was the last document to arrive

178
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,639
in the november and kind of that

179
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,680
that uh released the uh

180
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,319
the rest of the rc editor to work on it

181
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,039
um

182
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,240
and we didn't see any actual progress uh

183
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,400
until i guess about three weeks ago we

184
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,440
got uh num

185
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,560
the authors got a number of

186
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,639
clarification questions

187
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,199
uh on things and my understanding is

188
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,719
there so that changed

189
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,320
we are all we were in ref mode here

190
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,760
the uh just this this word um there

191
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,719
because uh this document points to this

192
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,720
document which points to this document

193
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,480
which points to this document so they

194
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,279
all have

195
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,959
have references to each other which you

196
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,480
can see actually here

197
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,240
um and that's why they're all going as a

198
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
as a group um

199
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
and so they changed to rsc editor with

200
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,640
the star

201
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,880
r about two weeks ago and

202
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,240
uh i'm anticipating an auth 48 any day

203
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,800
now

204
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,600
torilis said that we were looking at

205
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,279
four weeks maybe

206
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,600
and um that's about it

207
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,399
right yes i was in gather dot town going

208
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,560
to the rfc editor desk so it's actually

209
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,000
very nice tool especially for

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
all these procedural things and the nice

211
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,560
rfc editors were

212
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
looking up their internal cues and

213
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,839
showing me the stats and so

214
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,080
what they were willing to say publicly

215
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
is that the authors should receive auth

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,480
48 notification within a month

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,120
any questions on that

218
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,920
there it is yes i would like to take

219
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,279
this opportunity to

220
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,360
sex all those um draft orders

221
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,800
uh for your patient

222
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,079
and for your uh work hard for

223
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,680
so long time we actually much behave

224
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,120
our very primary schedule

225
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,040
but now that we were here and we are the

226
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,120
last mile to complete all those and

227
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,360
publish them so the others please

228
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
you know take the

229
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
last step will

230
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,480
and do their job good thank you

231
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
thank you all right

232
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,360
okay so who's going to present on the

233
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
constraint voucher status can somebody

234
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,079
please step

235
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,839
up to the microphone

236
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
and i'll just put it on my screen just a

237
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
second

238
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,160
sorry it's not i

239
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,399
sorry it's uh just a second i have to

240
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,839
save the pdf again

241
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
i just kept opening the wrong pdf and i

242
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,279
was like no wait that's the wrong pdf

243
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,639
um okay so um constraint document

244
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,360
um we've been working on this since uh a

245
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,639
lot since

246
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,560
uh the last ietf so we've had the

247
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,480
brewski design team meetings where we've

248
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,839
primarily worked through this with

249
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,880
github

250
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,200
um to remind anyone who is unfamiliar

251
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
with this this is essentially

252
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,680
uh a version of brewski um that brewski

253
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
uses est

254
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,519
that's rfc 80 70 30 http and tls

255
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,920
and this replaces a bunch of things so

256
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,720
um

257
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,639
est becomes co-app est http becomes

258
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,279
co-app

259
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,279
and tls becomes mostly becomes dtls

260
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
um so what have we fit changed in

261
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,399
oat in the 10th version um first of all

262
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,240
uh we have uh excised all of the

263
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
the cms bits so when we started this

264
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,000
work there was a belief that we

265
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,680
wanted to have cms signed seabor

266
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,720
um i didn't understand that request

267
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
because i thought that if you wanted to

268
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,079
go to seabor then why would you want cms

269
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
and so we've come to realize that the

270
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
people that wanted it realized that they

271
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
don't want it

272
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,959
um and we have uh

273
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,639
uh removed all those pieces of it um

274
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,560
we had done an early allocation of a

275
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,480
content type o

276
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
oid for cms um

277
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,839
and um after i think that part of the

278
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
effort here was very useful that it

279
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
allowed some people to do some interop

280
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
testing and then realize that they

281
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
didn't really want to do this

282
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,120
and so we've returned that content type

283
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,199
oid we've not uh to the iana

284
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,199
we had done a compressed version of the

285
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,120
request audit log

286
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
but we that doesn't make any sense

287
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,560
because that part is on the

288
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,920
part between the registrar and

289
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,839
the masa and that part remains http

290
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
um and so it makes no sense to make it

291
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
any shorter or do anything different

292
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,000
um almost every page was rewritten in uh

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,720
in some

294
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
fashion or or not so that you'll see

295
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
that there's diffs on almost every page

296
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
if you look at 09010

297
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,320
um so there's a lot of english changes a

298
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,160
lot of wording changes

299
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,279
uh there um we we currently

300
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,720
we removed the mandatory uh

301
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,760
discovery by the pledge um

302
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,839
it still required that the register be

303
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,240
willing to answer that discovery

304
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
um but uh we essentially said that if we

305
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
don't want to do that round trip

306
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,399
because saving you know six or seven

307
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:04,880
bytes

308
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,920
is not that important um then

309
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,240
don't bother uh doing that um

310
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
we have some text and this is perhaps

311
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,839
requires a little bit of thought and

312
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,880
review but

313
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,760
essentially um if it turns out that the

314
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,639
the

315
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,839
uh when you go and enroll um

316
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
if it turns out that the key that signs

317
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,040
your

318
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,399
new new um entity is in fact

319
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,480
your your certificate authority and

320
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,959
that's the thing that was in the voucher

321
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,600
then you already have the new ca key and

322
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,040
you don't need to retrieve it again so

323
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
that saves another round trip

324
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,240
there and in particular um there was

325
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,800
concern

326
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
that the ca keys could be large

327
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
and that may require that we use co-op

328
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,360
block mode and be able to support that

329
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
in all pledges

330
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,279
um and if you do this then maybe the

331
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,880
answer is you don't need to support it

332
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,399
and so there's some code that is

333
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,160
that potentially goes away um

334
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,839
we have a lot of text about how the

335
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,440
certificate is pinned

336
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
how the raw public key is pinned and

337
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,320
finally we clarify that the brewski mass

338
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,160
protocol is still http

339
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,240
uh one issue for 11 is that

340
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
well so this this uh

341
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,480
names in the yang uh were kind of long

342
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,399
and descriptive that we added and one of

343
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,440
the reasons why it

344
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,759
seemed reasonable to do this was because

345
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,120
they all get translated into

346
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
an integer via the

347
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
core comp protocol

348
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
and so they never appear on the wire so

349
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,880
they might as well be as long as you

350
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,000
like

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
so proximity register sha 256 of subject

352
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,240
public key info

353
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
is annoyingly long um in particular it

354
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,199
doesn't fit into our tables

355
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,759
so for that reason alone we think we

356
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,279
should change it because it means it's

357
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,880
very hard to present and talk about the

358
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,079
thing if it doesn't fit

359
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,559
you know like uh into what you're going

360
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,359
on

361
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,319
um and so we would really like to to

362
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,160
shorten it in some way and i don't know

363
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,880
what the right

364
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,199
white right set of things to probably

365
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,400
omit is

366
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,559
um probably it should be consistent with

367
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,760
if you're going to

368
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,679
shorten subject public key info then we

369
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,799
probably

370
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,199
should shorten the other one as well and

371
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,359
make it clear what it is we're doing

372
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,840
um so it could be you know pki could be

373
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,440
something else like this and

374
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,640
we just need to figure that out um

375
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
and there's possibly in 011 there are

376
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,280
possibly a couple more cases

377
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
you'll recall last summer we changed

378
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,400
brewski such

379
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,120
that we no longer put it under the est

380
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
well known but rather under the new

381
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,559
brewski well known and it's possible

382
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,600
that we still have

383
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,000
a couple of errors there in the document

384
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,720
issues that's underway this is what the

385
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
github looks like now

386
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,160
we have a number of issues we have three

387
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,919
open pull requests

388
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,360
um and we have i think it's 11 issues

389
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
open there

390
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,400
several of them have text already some

391
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,880
of them

392
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,720
are already essentially ready to be

393
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,559
closed we just need to be sure that

394
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,039
we're

395
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,039
we're we've done all the changes that we

396
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
expected to do

397
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,559
um and uh uh your help would be welcome

398

already taken care of

442
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,360
of those reviews that you're needing or

443
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,039
is there anything that you need me to do

444
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,039

445
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,320
help with that uh so

446
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,080
um i can't the chairs need to push the

447
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,480
button for asking for reviews or you can

448
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,120
do that

449
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,200
um and i've i've suggested to

450
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,240
um the other people that they can go to

451
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,039
their

452
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,919
they can add it as a review wish so that

453
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,360
they get assigned

454
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,120
um but i can't do that so um

455
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
um yeah that's really that's it i think

456
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
that whatever other

457
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,200
um uh requests i mean i said we got

458
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
for brewski we got an iot directorate

459
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
review a

460
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,960
uh security review and a gen art review

461
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
um and those were the three big three

462
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,799
big reviews uh

463
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,000
a year and a half ago um maybe it's two

464
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
years ago

465
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,880
um and um uh i would love to have the

466
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,559
same people come and look at look at

467
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,000
the constrained version because they

468
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,080
have a uh they're already

469
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,360
they already had criticisms and um that

470
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,240
were fixed and so it would be good to

471
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,880
know if

472
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,400

okay thank you i'll leave it to the

474
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,320

document uh more than welcome

479
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
um i'll certainly you know um we'll find

480
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,440
time for it

481
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
um next month um but yeah please uh

482
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,320
you know start the uh started on the

483
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,440
thread and uh

484
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,679
on on the mailing list and then uh the

485
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,760
chairs will be happy to help

486
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,840
find more of you

487
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,480
okay so we've got a problem with one of

488
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,679
the uh

489
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,600
presenters he actually um

490
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,120
joining the session it seems um

491
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,320
not sure if they're if he's going to

492
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,200
be able to to figure that out but i

493
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
think at this point in time we don't

494
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,600
have a presenter for uh

495
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
slot number four um unless somebody

496
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
wants to step to the

497
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,799
to the mic and tell me otherwise yes

498
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,240
i'm one of the order i would like to

499
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,360
make the very last limit

500
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,120
presentation i'm not sure i

501
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,720
i really because that's

502
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,760
him xinhua

503
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,799
made these slides so

504
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,480
i was saying well come on uh

505
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
presenting to somebody else's slides one

506
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,600
of the standard challenges

507
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,840
yeah that's a very challenge but

508
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,000
i'm not sure i can say my screen

509
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,120
it says screen share is being started um

510
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
if you just have problems with the

511
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,679
screen share i

512
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,400
i can certainly help with that

513
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,240
i think i can

514
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000
yes how about now

515
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,520
yep okay now that's

516
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,880
good so uh because i'm

517
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,880
one of the uh causer so i do have the

518
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,279
uh right and i have to do this work if

519
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,200
nobody they are

520
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,799
what we made is the uh

521
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
only one version from 101 version 202

522
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,010
version from a last meeting

523
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,080
[Music]

524
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,799
and this draft is building about

525
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,679
to distribute information along the

526
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,080
acers and also around the a

527
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,520
different and

528
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,799
components so we focus on how to

529
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,720
distribute information along the

530
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,400
different agent

531
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,440
um this draft

532
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,880
was adopted as a working document

533
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,440
in last year february

534
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,559
since then we collect all the comments

535
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,840
in the mailing list

536
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,720
and including that in the open issues

537
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,440
and

538
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,799
by now we have we already

539
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,400
addressed most of them we add

540
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
more reference to the i said yeah

541
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,200
um one of the major

542
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,039
change change from a zero zero version

543
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
to a one machine

544
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,360
actually made before last meeting

545
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,679
is we integrate the draft capital

546
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,679
grassroot package into this

547
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,039
working group draft that's make it

548
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,559
possible to

549
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
distribute information that cannot be

550
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,400
transferred

551
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,120
at one message so

552
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,960
and in this this

553
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,159
updates before this meeting we meet when

554
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
focused on the addressing the comments

555
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,120
about the use case

556
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
we add more reference to the use case in

557
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,960
the introduction

558
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
and thinking we

559
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,760
hopefully better explanation of

560
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,279
the required context of the connected

561
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,320
entire case

562
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,000
we also add the consideration use case

563
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,480
example of a

564
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,330
fairway update

565
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,520
[Music]

566
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,440
we also consider to move in the examples

567
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,919
from

568
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:39,840
appendix into the core text

569
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,080
and we also focus on the

570
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,039
complete the reversed v2x use case

571
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,880
with reference to the 5ta

572
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,400
whitepaper at the real-time hd

573
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,159
maps and in-car information

574
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,240
infra payment also the software

575
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,760
updates be added and

576
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,880
we add a new use case distributed

577
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,080
distributed computing applications

578
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,799
information

579
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,480
yeah and we are still open to

580
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,240
add more use cases if anybody

581
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,919
uh makes that request

582
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,720
in their future future

583
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,399
and basically that's the

584
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,919
update when we've uh considered the

585
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,120
physical reverse the current text we

586
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,520
will

587
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,559
focus on the other set of comments to

588
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,320
prepare the next osu version

589
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,440
and we hope we can

590
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,480
be ready for the

591
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,440
last call because i mean before becoming

592
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,799
the working group document

593
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,840
we already make this document for a long

594
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,720
while

595
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,000
uh giving the the rack uh the working

596
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,880
group

597
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,039
giving the priority so hopefully we can

598
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,480
be really unstable for next meeting

599
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,200
thanks that's all

600
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,840
any questions comments

601
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,120
thank you very much uh i was just

602
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,080
looking up the

603
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,640
the history and uh yeah as a reminder

604
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,159
the document has been

605
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,000
uh because of primarily

606
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,799
you know our focus on the first round of

607
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,919
the charter been

608
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,520
um carried on for for a very long time

609
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
um as a non-working group document

610
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,520
before we uh as a working will tell that

611
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,840
with the recharging everything

612
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,240
we could have taken up as a working

613
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,880
group

614
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,600
document but i think during those years

615
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:03,919
it

616
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,120
has matured significantly and so even

617
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,760
though

618
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,600
it's a working group document only for a

619
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
short period of time

620
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
i very much hope that we can also try to

621
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,640
you know start thinking about its exit

622
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,159
strategy to iesg

623
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,480
during this year and um so

624
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,440
i reviewed the changes so and obviously

625
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,679
with uh the feedback from the shepard

626
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,240
uh review that i gave um i'm i'm quite

627
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,039
happy with it

628
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,159
so um would hope that maybe

629
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,720
uh shame towards the um the next uh

630
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,279
itf in summer uh we could start thinking

631
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:41,760
about

632
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,559
uh bringing it up for last call um so

633
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:44,960
maybe

634
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,559
uh the co-authors can think about if

635
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,399
if they feel there's anything left to

636
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,879
work there

637
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,240
okay thank you

638
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,399
so i stopped sharing

639
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,760
you'll come around all right

640
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,240
with somebody uh in possession of bruce

641
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,000
the ae slides please step up

642
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
to the microphone i think that's the

643
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,520
next uh

644
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
yes that's probably me

645
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,039
yes

646
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,520
so i hope i'm grabbing the right screen

647
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,760
yes

648
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,159
all right so i would like uh can you can

649
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:34,960
see the screen

650
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,480
okay i would like to give an update on

651
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,440
brewski ae

652
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,760
that was a the last version of the draft

653
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,880
was provided in

654
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,720
january and uh you can see here the list

655
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
of authors and one also has been added

656
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,600
to the list with

657
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,159
who's thomas lennar uh who also

658
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,799
participates in the meeting today

659
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,039
so

660
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,240
just to recall what the draft is about

661
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,000
so in the draft as such

662
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,360
uh is enhancing the the brewski

663
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,480
model with some further use case so one

664
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,640
use case relates to a limited on-site

665
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,559
pki functionality

666
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,039
and another use case uh reverses the

667
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,960
role of the pledge actually to

668
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,080
to be a client to be a server rather

669
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,519
than a client so that means that the

670
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,559
pledge is being

671
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,159
asked for certain information that he

672
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,279
should be pride to the to the registrar

673
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,760
so we used to call that pull and push

674
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,320
but

675
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,600
there is some discussion on the

676
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,559
terminology that comes up later

677
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,039
so the draft addresses those two use

678
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,240
cases by basically

679
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,760
relying on signed objects or we call it

680
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,240
authenticated self-contained objects

681
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,480
which utilize the signature from either

682
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,399
on the pledge site using the idf

683
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,799
id or from the infrastructure sites or

684
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,720
the registrar site

685
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,360
so that is just a short wrap-up about

686
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,559
what is a

687
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,000
draft about so what has been changed

688
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,120
from version

689
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
0 0 to 0 1 um

690
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,200
so we updated some of the scope sections

691
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
and

692
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,480
at the beginning to motivate or to

693
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
provide a better motivation for the use

694
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,000
case too

695
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,320
in which the the pledge itself acts as a

696
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,760
server so that

697
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,440
as i said reverses the model that bruce

698
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,799
key right now is working on

699
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,279
we had some some rework specifically in

700
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,559
the use case too

701
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,120
regarding the push what we called the

702
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,600
push model

703
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,640
because in the last itf meeting and also

704
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,559
in the design team we discussed about

705
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,480
the trust relationship

706
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,200
between the device of the agent that is

707
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,519
basically onboarding the pledge

708
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,919
and in the first round we discussed

709
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,000
about the usage of tls

710
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,760
to protect the communication between the

711
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,559
pledge and the pledge agent

712
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,799
that has been fed into the draft and

713
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,039
some we had further discussion on the

714
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,799
design team afterwards

715
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,000
which showed that the approach that uh

716
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,760
or how tls was used basically

717
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,799
utilizing pre-shared key which is for

718
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,880
instance provided to the agent

719
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,320
by using a qr code is not the optimal

720
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,440
approach here

721
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,159
that would also closely relate for

722
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,919
instance to dpp

723
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,600
so there is a proposal to change the

724
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,039
current tls approach which

725
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,399
control later on the slides so we also

726
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,679
have a first description of the

727
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,279
exchanged object included

728
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,760
in the in the drafts which needs more

729
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,720
work

730
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,960
they basically concentrate on an example

731
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
of object types that are used on the

732
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,720
different endpoints

733
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,120
in the call flow we would like to

734
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,918
provide this as

735
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,039
an example basically in the draft to be

736
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,159
able to

737
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,480
to come up with an implementation but to

738
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,519
leave it open if

739
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,840
other object types are being supported

740
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,200
on top

741
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,880
then we had some further clarification

742
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
and discovery options for the enrollment

743
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,360
uh endpoints which are on the domain

744
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,480
registrar

745
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,560
so we initially thought we could follow

746
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,159
a similar approach like

747
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,760
for constraint voucher for instance but

748
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,119
that is not possible for the http

749
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,599
so we decided to to not provide the

750
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,520
discovery mechanism for the registrar

751
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,599
and basically assume that the registrar

752
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,679
has the functionality to either serve

753
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,480
the client

754
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,679
or the pledge or not and if it's not

755
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,359
possible to serve it then he would

756
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,119
issue an error message based on that we

757
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,239
also updated the

758
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,440
illustrative example that was included

759
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,079
also thanks to michael for taking over

760
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,839
the

761
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,280
the risk brewski well known

762
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,159
in the main document which which allows

763
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,000
specifically the use case one

764
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,480
uh to utilize all the other protocols

765
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
and for

766
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,040
enrollment and not mixing up the

767
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,480
and then with the certificate handling

768
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,000
and we also started with a security

769
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,680
consideration

770
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
section and updated sensor references

771
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,160
and as i said uh thomas is

772
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,800
uh one of the new co-authors so

773
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,000
regarding the

774
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,320
the uh trust establishment that i named

775
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,280
before

776
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,160
so the goal at the very f so the goal as

777
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,960
such uh

778
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,720
is to have a trust establishment between

779
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,400
the pledge and the registrar

780
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,680
without uh idly not

781
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,920
having a binding to the underlying tls

782
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,200
function

783
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,079
so that trust relationship is being

784
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,520
established based on authenticated

785
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,960
self-contained objects

786
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,440
so the kind of objects we talked about

787
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
we have uh

788
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,119
proposed some method to to provide a

789
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,800
discovery of the pledge by the pledge

790
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,599
agent

791
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,800
using mdns and then once

792
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,079
the pledge agent can be contacted on

793
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,280
the respective end points um

794
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,480
what is we would follow or we

795
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,640
proposed in the o1 version uh

796
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,040
the trust establishment based on the tls

797
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,800
connection so the assumption was that we

798
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
have a qr code available

799
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,119
with pledge specific information and

800
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,280
submitted information to be able to

801
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,720
have some kind of proof of proximity

802
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,078
so that the patch agent

803
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,599
would onboard the pledge has was in

804
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,400
physical

805
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
proximity to the pledge so he was able

806
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,960
to scan basically secure our code

807
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,720
and the discussion and the design team

808
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,400
showed that if we would

809
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
utilize this approach that that is

810
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,359
not the favorite approach because

811
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,920
different reasons so tls psk was one

812
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,720
reason and then the qr code that

813
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,040
essentially has the the pre-shared keys

814
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,280
and further information included there

815
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,839
so alternatives we currently discuss as

816
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:54,400
uh

817
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
not using teals between the pledge and

818
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,640
the pledge agent

819
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,520
so what is the reason for for going away

820
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,560
with

821
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,040
tls so the reason for introducing it in

822
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,320
the first place was not

823
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,000
to provide uh authentication between the

824
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,839
the pledge and the pledge agent but it

825
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,119
was rather intended

826
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
as a dos protection denial of service

827
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,880
protection

828
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,440
so this is probably only necessary for

829
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
the registrar endpoint because the

830
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,079
pledge itself in the

831
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,880
push case may reside on a separate

832
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,079
network

833
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,359
so um we decided

834
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
that or we proposed uh in the design

835
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,200
team that

836
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,440
the register certificate is provided by

837
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,960
the pledge agent

838
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,480
uh to the to the pledge and included by

839
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,440
the by the patch and the voter request

840
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,079
so the pledge agent would simply forward

841
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,000
that

842
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,520
so that would be included sorry that

843
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,760
would be included as a new leaf which

844
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,520
could be something like agent provided

845
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,119
register

846
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,960
so that information is then forwarded

847
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,520
via the patch agent to the

848
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,320
registrar and the registrar can verify

849
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,440
uh on one hand

850
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,560
if he is the the your

851
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,280
registrar uh responsible for the

852
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,040
onboarding on one hand and on the other

853
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,880
hand if the pledge is the right patch to

854
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,320
be on board

855
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,160
based on the information that is in the

856
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,599
idf id

857
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,560
uh contained

858
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,280
so that then that other check that can

859
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,200
be done on the register side

860
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,040
and the mazda can also verify the

861
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
certificate which is obtained in the

862
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,240
in the voucher from the from the

863
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,119
registrar

864
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,480
so again it's not a proximity register

865
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,680
third it would be something like an

866
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,520
agent-provided register

867
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,119
uh based on that the mazda could decide

868
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,599
which which of the current voucher

869
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,359
assertion would be used for that like

870
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,880
verified or locked

871
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,720
or we could also define a new insertion

872
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,800
there

873
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,240
so um let me jump to the to the backup

874
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,880
because i have a call flow there that

875
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
basically depicts

876
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
the the general approach here so i

877
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,240
stretched the

878
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,560
brewski architecture up there so what

879
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,400
you can see here is the pledge agent

880
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,280
that connects

881
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,839
to the pledge and then there are some

882
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,280
exchanges here

883
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,240
um those are just examples so we we just

884
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,480
used the voucher request and the voucher

885
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,280
uh yeah the voucher request trigger uh

886
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,520
and

887
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,000
didn't display the the certification

888
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
request trigger here

889
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,000
so a service technician for instance

890
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,839
would take the pledge agent connect to

891
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,640
the pledge

892
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
fetch the information like the voucher

893
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,079
request and obviously also the

894
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,000
certification request and then

895
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,440
disconnects from there if he's in a

896
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,040
building he might be in the seller and

897
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,960
then steps up connects to the to the

898
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,920
network that

899
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,000
uh hosts the domain registrar and

900
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,440
provides information to the domain

901
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,040
registrar

902
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,839
and then the normal brewski run can

903
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:54,880
happen here

904
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,520
and once he gets the information about

905
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
the voucher and also about the

906
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,800
certificate he can step back to the

907
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,599
seller

908
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,400
connect to the to the pledge again and

909
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:04,880
then

910
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,839
basically provide that information so i

911
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,160
put

912
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,960
this drawing because i think it's it's

913
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,000
easier to

914
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,520
to understand than just the written

915
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,359
proposal here so what what do we lose

916
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,440
when we go forward with that approach is

917
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,680
the proximity to the registrar via the

918
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,839
mutual authenticated tls so in

919
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,359
comparison to

920
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,040
the original ruski document

921
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,880
and the assertion in the voucher so we

922
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,839
we can't provide something like a

923
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,560
register

924
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,440
a proximity register certificate there

925
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,480
yep

926
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,280
just the scroll bar on your slide deck

927
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,880
makes me a little bit worried about our

928
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,800
time planning so if you can speed up a

929
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,280
little bit that would be appreciated

930
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,520
okay so what do we lose means uh the

931
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,480
proximity

932
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,640
to the registrar and what do we gain as

933
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,839
a flexible

934
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,440
flexibility in the bootstrapping

935
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,119
approach by keeping the number of the

936
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,319
round trips that we

937
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,160
have in brewski the question would be

938
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
are there any thoughts about that

939
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,920
approach and specifically about

940
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,079
not utilizing tls between the initial

941
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,760
connection between the agent and the

942
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,720
the pledge this is probably something

943
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,760
for the for the sake

944
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,440
of time that we can discuss

945
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,200
uh the trust establishment between the

946
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,280
pledge agent and the registrar

947
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,800
uh is currently expected to to be done

948
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,359
using an lfid so the pledge agent is

949
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,440
already known to the registrar

950
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,359
and uh has has an lfid that he can use

951
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,760
to authenticate towards the registrar

952
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,960
that has the advantage that the end

953
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,640
points that already exist

954
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,119
based on brewski on the register can be

955
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:53,839
reused

956
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,720
and the register itself may distinguish

957
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,760
between a pledge

958
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,040
onboarding or a pledge agent on boarding

959
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,680
based on the fact that he's either using

960
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,279
an lfid or an either body

961
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,720
okay so this uh i can jump over that

962
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
quickly this this is the first

963
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,280
proposal for object types for the

964
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,200
different endpoints

965
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,960
on the uh on the pledge agent

966
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,920
that are used to to communicate or to

967
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,520
get the voucher requests the voucher

968
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,319
response

969
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,920
objects and also the certification

970
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,520
request

971
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,200
and the certificate itself onto the

972
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,119
pledge

973
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,440
most of them you see is to be discussed

974
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
so we need some further discussion on

975
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,720
the object types there

976
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,400
i just wanted to put that here as

977
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,800
information how it could look like

978
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,440
but we would like to open the discussion

979
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,760
there and also keep the possibility to

980
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
utilize other

981
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,640
encodings um then

982
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,200
some terminology discussion we currently

983
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,160
have

984
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
we currently call that object here in

985
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,240
the middle the pledge agent

986
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,319
but essentially what it does is it has a

987
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,480
closer relationship to the to the domain

988
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,599
register

989
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,079
and it actually acts uh in in certain

990
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,040
ways as

991
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,079
an agent for the registrar the proposal

992
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,359
is to to go away from pledge agent

993
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,759
and rename it to register agent

994
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,000
other just as a question to the room if

995
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,480
there is any uh

996
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,400
any thoughts about the uh renaming

997
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,560
if

998
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,480
okay we we can also discuss at the other

999
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,319
i think that's a

1000
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,319
low hanging fruit and we can put that to

1001
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,440
the mailing list

1002
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,760
uh we have a further terminology

1003
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,240
discussion that relates to pull and push

1004
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,960
um we had some discussion on the mailing

1005
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,720
list and also on the design team and

1006
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,920
michael suggested that we have some kind

1007
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,960
of renaming

1008
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,160
better naming to to not confuse people

1009
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,359
with those

1010
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,800
uh their terms here

1011
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,599
so alternatives may be a client server

1012
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,760
mode for the pledge or pledge initiated

1013
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,160
or agent-initiated bootstrapping

1014
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,040
results could be alternatives to pull

1015
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,800
and push

1016
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,680
also if there are any sorts we can

1017
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,040
discuss it

1018
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,160
the mailing list

1019
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,800
okay so then we had some

1020
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,640
some discussion and open issues from the

1021
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,920
last itf meeting

1022
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,680
one was the discovery of enrollment

1023
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,839
options on the register

1024
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,119
we removed that get well now and

1025
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,240
basically assume that the pledge is the

1026
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,000
one that does a constructivise and

1027
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,760
implements only one approach for the

1028
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,040
bootstrapping

1029
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,079
and onboarding and uh the registrar is a

1030
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,240
more flexible component and

1031
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,119
either it supports the the onboarding

1032
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,000
method

1033
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,680
proposed by the pledge or doesn't

1034
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,920
support it and

1035
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,040
yeah so so we don't see read the

1036
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,400
the value of of the discovery here

1037
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,720
so we close that one so pledge agent

1038
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,480
authentication authorization

1039
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,160
there's an ongoing discussion in the

1040
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,599
current status as i said

1041
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,000
rely on health id uh for for that

1042
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,720
and uh the necessity of providing the

1043
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,119
proximity registrar certificate has been

1044
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,920
addressed so far that has to be taken

1045
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,760
into the draft obviously

1046
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,359
but the approach is to have something

1047
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,319
like an agent provided certificate

1048
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,839
which can then be verified by the

1049
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:37,920
registrar

1050
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,680
last but not least we had the discussion

1051
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,440
on consideration of different transport

1052
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,319
options

1053
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,440
in the addressing scheme and currently

1054
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,520
we still assume to follow the blueskee

1055
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,440
approach using http

1056
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,839
but it could be enhanced in the future

1057
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:52,800
to also

1058
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,720
address co-op or over dtls or also osco

1059
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:01,280
next steps we obviously need some

1060
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
further refinement of the

1061
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,960
pledge server so the push approach

1062
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,119
in the design team addressing further

1063
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,599
open issues and questions

1064
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,040
uh one relates to is still the

1065
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,880
discussion of the trust relationships

1066
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
another one is the alignment of object

1067
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,040
types that we have and that we would

1068
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,400
like to reflect on the draft

1069
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,280
yeah and then there is a

1070
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,599
there was a some clarification of their

1071
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,960
implementation options

1072
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,680
uh that would utilize different encoding

1073
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,960
schemes

1074
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,079
uh which should be done preferably in

1075
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,400
additional documents and not all in one

1076
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,280
document

1077
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,079
to be able to have a better clustering

1078
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,520
of the functionality

1079
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,920
so then we have some terminology

1080
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,599
clarifications

1081
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,160
and uh for the open issues that are

1082
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,319
stated throughout the draft so like

1083
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,079
we always have something like to be

1084
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,920
discussed in the draft and that needs to

1085
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,000
be addressed

1086
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,800
okay so far for rush through the

1087
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,280
document

1088
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,720
okay yeah sorry uh always good content

1089
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,119
but

1090
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,160
we're running out of time can we uh i

1091
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,760
think we need to take questions to the

1092
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,240
list

1093
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,160
um about this because of where we are

1094
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,920
um yeah can we get a constrained joint

1095
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,520
proxy please

1096
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:30,240
and maybe uh

1097
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,160
can this be done in something like five

1098
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,879
to six minutes

1099
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,000
and we can't hear you yet except we can

1100
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,240
yeah we can live reading is probably

1101
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,720
uh so i'm waiting for you to agree to my

1102
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,839
oh i have to push the other button sorry

1103
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,800
constrained okay the short and sweet of

1104
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,280
this

1105
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:07,599
is that we adopted in november

1106
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,440
there we go um it proposes the

1107
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,760
replacement of circuit proxy um it does

1108
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,599
this with dtls

1109
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,839
um and there's some it does it in a

1110
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,920
stateless way by essentially inserting

1111
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:20,400
some

1112
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,480
uh content into a detail a tls extension

1113
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,920
uh so that you can know

1114
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,200
where to return the packet

1115
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,400
when uh the they get back to the uh

1116
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
joined proxy um and the joint proxy

1117
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,200
doesn't have to actually keep any state

1118
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,000
which

1119
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,880
allows it to be very cheap and resilient

1120
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,520
to

1121
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,720
um uh through

1122
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,160
general service attacks um

1123
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,599
we have some better explanation of it um

1124
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,640
and now there's a discovery

1125
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,280
part of this as well so the joint talks

1126
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,720
we can both announce itself

1127
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,920
and uh be discovered there

1128
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,920
um it's pretty much haven't done really

1129
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,359
anything since

1130
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,078
uh the last itf there no

1131
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,200
pretty much ready for last call anyone

1132
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,079
read this document

1133
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,400
lately

1134
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,880
yeah i was planning to read it soon

1135
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,240
thanks esther

1136
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,040
um one uh question with respect to this

1137
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,640
ewing koa

1138
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,240
um that's a protocol that's owned by

1139
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,359
another working group

1140
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,040
so is there some you know sorry i'm

1141
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,800
probably chair should know some some

1142
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,880
defined process by which kind of the way

1143
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,720
that the protocol is used or so

1144
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,520
we're not we're not changing collapse uh

1145
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,559
in any way

1146
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,640
um in fact if anything the review we

1147
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,839
want is from the tls working group

1148
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,720
probably uh because we are

1149
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,640
using a uh tls uh component

1150
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,839
to do the um am i right do i get that

1151
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,599
wrong no we're using co-op stateless

1152
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,280
excuse me um to get the response back

1153
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,200
no we're not who can't be that's the

1154
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,960
other protocol excuse me i was right

1155
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,839
it's a tls

1156
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,359
it's a tls thing so we have another

1157
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,200
document that is using stateless

1158
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,599
but that's not in this working group um

1159
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,839
so the the state part goes into a tls

1160
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,319
extension um

1161
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,640
and anything we need that review for

1162
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,880
that that piece

1163
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,760
okay so you're saying that co core has

1164
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,960
no right nor

1165
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,359
should it have any quarrels uh with what

1166
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,040
you're doing so we don't care about them

1167
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,599
but we should try to find the

1168
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,079
tls review when it gets uh closer to the

1169
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,520
end

1170
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,240
yeah no it's now now is the time to get

1171
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,359
that review

1172
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,760
um as we go to a to a working group last

1173
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,400
call

1174
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,160
is that something you think would be

1175
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,880
helpful if we as chairs ask for it or

1176
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,119
yes

1177
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,520
ask for a sector review with emphasis on

1178
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,000
tls

1179
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:09,839
what

1180
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:24,079
okay next one laura i think you're up

1181
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,440
hello can you hear me

1182
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:37,839
hello perez can you hear me

1183
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,480
i can hear you

1184
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,480
okay good thanks

1185
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,880
can you see what i'm saying um

1186
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,760
yes for now yeah don't hear your full

1187
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,160
screen

1188
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,559
okay here you go okay good so yeah

1189
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,440
good an update on the guidelines for

1190
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,960
autonomic service agents

1191
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,319
so i'm presenting on behalf of the

1192
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,079
co-authors brian chang and

1193
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,640
pierre so these documents has been

1194
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,000
adopted as working group

1195
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,119
document end of last year in november

1196
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,520
and uh just following that we got a

1197
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,640
document shepard review from turles

1198
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,680
and the only diff that you could see

1199
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,640
from the individual id that was before

1200
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:28,960
that

1201
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:33,680
is just to fix some update of references

1202
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,520
um so we got a detailed review from

1203
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,119
trellis thanks for that

1204
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,480
um so i will not go necessarily through

1205
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,359
all the

1206
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,800
sections that are always commented on

1207
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,640
but just raising a few important points

1208
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,440
so

1209
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,400
we have a lot of work still on the

1210
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,559
suggestion for clarification editorial

1211
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:50,880
uh

1212
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,359
improvement of the draft but there are a

1213
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,319
couple of

1214
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,960
other aspects related for to update for

1215
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,599
instance

1216
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,640
in section two

1217
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,680
with um allowing a more diverse approach

1218
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,200
for the bayesian of asa we have

1219
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,960
something that is a bit too constraining

1220
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,160
right now um section three

1221
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,040
um trolleys introduce a question related

1222
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,160
to um

1223
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,440
allowing different security

1224
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,599
bootstrapping approaches too so i think

1225
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,400
this also will

1226
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,839
be a discussion that we will have for

1227
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,599
the next update

1228
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,480
and also some updates on we have a text

1229
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,240
talking about policy and intent and at

1230
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,280
the time of

1231
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,720
i mean charter one of anima uh this was

1232
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,000
a bit ruled out so

1233
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,920
it's a bit old text we need to to update

1234
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,800
that also to newer references

1235
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,200
um some aspect about security

1236
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,240
consideration in other sections

1237
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,480
and on the design of grasp suggestion

1238
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,359
for improvement

1239
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,680
on the different set of aspects related

1240
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,680
to what is described there

1241
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,760
to be a bit more fluid in the in the

1242
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,319
description

1243
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,160
um we have some things to fix also in

1244
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,280
the life cycle

1245
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,920
uh some terminology will probably be

1246
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,359
introduced

1247
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,599
uh and also this won't be great we have

1248
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,480
the use of term

1249
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,359
objectives several places in the draft

1250
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,520
so to disambiguate if it's

1251
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,240
the most informal grasp objective as in

1252
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,160
the protocol or if it's a

1253
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,040
english term of objectives so we will

1254
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,640
have to find a way to

1255
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,160
differentiate diet we have also a

1256
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,160
section on coordination with traditional

1257
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,280
management functions section 8

1258
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,880
where we need also to make some

1259
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,880
improvements section 9

1260
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,799
robustness some some further

1261
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,480
inputs from turles that will be useful

1262
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,079
for the revision and

1263
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,319
some stuff to improve also in security

1264
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:43,359
considerations

1265
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,400
especially towards authorization and

1266
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,640
a few fix it's an informational

1267
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,240
documents and we have some

1268
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,640
references that appear in the normative

1269
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,839
part so we will have to

1270
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:56,000
to improve that so this is based on the

1271
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
review from turles

1272
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,400
very useful and this is uh ongoing

1273
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,359
revision that we have

1274
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:05,680
in the meantime also brian a co-author

1275
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,480
of this draft

1276
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,240
made a kind of experiment a proof of

1277
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,240
concept about the

1278
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,079
asei life cycle and so it created a few

1279
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,799
functionality and run that in his

1280
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,160
implementation of different

1281
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,440
um anima technologies um

1282
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,240
and its main conclusion on the needed

1283
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,119
support or

1284
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,599
with the new features needed uh to to

1285
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:32,960
have a good support for the aza

1286
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,400
lifecycle is

1287
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,640
essentially that a kind of single new

1288
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,359
feature will be needed

1289
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,079
it's essentially working in the main

1290
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,559
loop

1291
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:46,400
of the asa and it's a kind of

1292
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,720
let's say watchdog check run type of

1293
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,319
functionality that

1294
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,280
informs the aza either to be able to

1295
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:53,920
continue

1296
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,559
if the check of this function is

1297
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,359
positive

1298
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:00,720
or rather to exit gracefully in case

1299
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,839
it is written false um so this is uh

1300
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,079
to the world of brian just a a simple

1301
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,799
proof of concept but it was useful to

1302
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:12,160
let's say uh do some experiment based on

1303
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:12,960
the

1304
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,720
the content that we have in this draft

1305
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,520
with a bit of real code

1306
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,200
and this is available i mean the report

1307
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,799
from brian is available on the mailing

1308
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,200
list archive

1309
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,079
so our plans for the next version of

1310
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,119
course to address

1311
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,520
the pending review comments that we have

1312
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,960
and we of course welcome

1313
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,799
additional feedback and reviews on the

1314
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,160
draft the document was

1315
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,079
already quite stable technically

1316
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,440
speaking uh

1317
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,400
before the working group adoption but we

1318
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,799
welcome additional reviews and feedback

1319
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,079
we will we find the content um there are

1320
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,440
a few technical change

1321
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,640
that we need to uh to put together

1322
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,599
uh and also our goal with this uh new

1323
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:54,720
version is to to

1324
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,160
in this document is to put good

1325
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,640
foundations for the future work in anima

1326
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,400
around what we we had in previous

1327
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,640
meetings called aza ecosystem

1328
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,599
so um looking to the use cases and

1329
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,839
applications and maybe also detailing

1330
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,440
some examples of different

1331
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,079
autonomous autonomic functions and

1332
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,520
autonomic service agents

1333
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,319
and also to really highlight some

1334
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,200
consideration

1335
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,040
uh concerning the design implementation

1336
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,839
and deployment of such

1337
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:25,119
software packages the end

1338
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,040
i mean the target that we have for such

1339
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,000
an update is by the end of this month

1340
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,760
and that's it for the update on this

1341
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,240
document

1342
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,558
all right thank you very much

1343
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,079

1345
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,119
time a little bit so

1346
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,599
do you want to say something um you know

1347
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,520
or do you have questions

1348
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,319

1355
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,319
projection permission yet

1356
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,839
um but uh anyway so we posted this

1357
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,200
document

1358
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,400
and um uh it's about j

1359
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,160
jose signed jason and

1360
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,319
um um

1361
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,520
um there's examples there's

1362
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,760
explanation of to why thank you for the

1363
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,599
button there we go

1364
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,319
um and this is an example of what it

1365
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,520
looks like

1366
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,720
um a little bit weird is

1367
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,599
that we've decided to go with the jws

1368
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,079
compact serialization um

1369
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,599
so that's the kind that's actually

1370
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,599
there's more libraries that deal with

1371
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,760
um but it does mean that we are sending

1372
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,760
64 encoded

1373
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,160
url encoded not the regular kind uh

1374
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,480
within the https which is a bit

1375
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,799
uh on a bit weird because we don't need

1376
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:06,400
to encode it but we are

1377
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,720
um and that's about it it's very short

1378
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,319
and sweet um it's like

1379
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,359
um you know nine pages to the

1380
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:16,559
to the examples so uh i think that it

1381
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,240
fits fairly well into the working group

1382
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,480
there is desire to use this in i believe

1383
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,520
the opc

1384
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,720
ua protocol under adoption of brewski

1385
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,319
and it's already been implemented by

1386
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,720
siemens so it was great to have this as

1387
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,040
a

1388
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,079
working group document thank you

1389
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,799
well thanks and given how this is ops i

1390
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,240
dare to ask the question

1391
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,240
uh where is the user in the device that

1392
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,720
needs this

1393
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,319
the user is the opc ua which is an

1394
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:46,559
industrial iot foundation that's existed

1395
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,079
since the 90s

1396
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,880
and they have indicated that they are

1397
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,720
interested in adopting brewski but that

1398
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,240
they don't want to do cms

1399
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,240
and we had time maybe thomas could talk

1400
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,879
more about it

1401
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,160
yeah i mean i'm i'm always happy to have

1402
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,599
these type of explanations

1403
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,040
in documents um

1404
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,799
you hadn't didn't have the time to read

1405
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,799
up on the details so if if that detail

1406
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:17,440
isn't there

1407
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,680
so it's a document that's fine we can we

1408
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,799
can get some

1409
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,880
some clear statements as to who's doing

1410
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,720
it there

1411
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,799
and is that is that kind of the only

1412
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,079
thing and in terms of it

1413
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,240
it looks to me kind of um i mean what

1414
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,559
is that the only dependence i mean so

1415
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,880
they plug it into some other workflow

1416
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,480
right because uh

1417
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,599
just having this other one

1418
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,799
they plug it into brewski so

1419
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,480
the whole world out of existing itf docu

1420
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,319
drafts but then for some reason they

1421
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,319
don't like cms

1422
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,000
correct that would involve them putting

1423
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,319
libraries and code into their devices

1424
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,000
that they currently don't use

1425
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,880
and they already are using uh jws in

1426
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,839
their code

1427
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,079
that's my understanding at some point in

1428
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,160
time it would be a great topic for iot

1429
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,079
ops to figure out how to support

1430
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,680
or not support the variable preferences

1431
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,160
for

1432
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,000
uh yeah it's i'm just kidding

1433
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,680
the registrars have to support and the

1434
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,280
mass i have to

1435
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,799
potentially have to support multiple

1436
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,960
things but they're not constrained

1437
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,559
at all in that they're you know

1438
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:28,480
appliances um

1439
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,839
and the devices in the factory floor are

1440
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,760
not that constrained but they don't want

1441
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,520
code there they don't need to have

1442
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,240
don't need want to maintain so it's

1443
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,319
about lightweight

1444
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:41,680
it's lightweight it's not that

1445
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,359
constrained but it is lightweight it is

1446
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,599
it is plugged in ethernet they are not

1447
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,920
doing onboarding of the networking they

1448
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,920
are doing onboarding to the application

1449
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,960
server

1450
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,280
okay so jose claims itself to be more

1451
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,480
lightweight on the patch

1452
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,799
it's just code it's just a question of

1453
01:01:58,799 --> 01:01:59,520
of

1454
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,280
of what code and you can implement it

1455
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,119
trivially in java

1456
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,359
um whereas cms is a little bit painful

1457
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,200
to do in java

1458
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,400
and you can do jose and php if you want

1459
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,400
okay interesting

1460
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,680
all right and i think that's a wrap

1461
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,319
sorry for staying over two minutes um

1462
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,640
let's take all the open questions to the

1463
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,240
uh to the list and

1464
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,160
i'm also on gather dot town if you have

1465
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,680
any more questions

1466
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,920
um so please feel free to reach out

1467
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,760
there as well

1468
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,079
and see you next time and we'll see

1469
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,760
whether that's cyberspace or san

1470
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:48,400
francisco space

1471
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,480
you
