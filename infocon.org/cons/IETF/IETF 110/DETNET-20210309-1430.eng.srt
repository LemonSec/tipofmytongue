00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,800
and welcome to uh net at

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,639
ietf 110 online i'm lou berger we have

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,960

secretary

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,080
ethan grossman this is our second

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,080
session and the

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,480
information is um posted

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,679
as was as we talked about um

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,719
yesterday this is an itf meeting

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,000
i think you all know that and uh i

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,600
most are familiar with the rules that

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,280
govern our

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,440
participation and our process if you're

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
not please

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,800
go look up the note well everything we

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,520
say here

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,480
it becomes part of our public record and

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,760
it is being recorded

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
we're using meat echo you're here with

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
me so of course you know that and

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
meet echo automatically handles our blue

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,760
sheets

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,199
and um it does have a chat channel the

25
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,760
jabber is still there if you want to go

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,080
directly into that

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,320
note-taking you've seen in chat we're

28
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,479
using code emd please jump in and help

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:14,799
us

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,680
uh take notes and capture what is said

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,640
that's particularly

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,600
important if you make a comment um

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,880
whether it's in jabber

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
or in um at the mic i'd like to have

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
that captured uh comments that are set

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,920
in jabber will be

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,119
repeated um in general uh

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
if for some reason you don't want it

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,640
repeated that's fine but then don't add

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,119
that to the minutes

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,759
as i mentioned yesterday the tools page

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,040
seems to be having a little bit of

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,520
trouble

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,840
so you might want to go to data tracker

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759
i'll point out that the data tracker now

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,399
has

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,600
the htm the tools format html which

48
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,560
personally works much better for me so

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,479
may wish to go there

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,520
we're in our second session we have a

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,560
joint session

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,680
on friday with that's being hosted by

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
pals

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,880
it's joint with mpls in spring and it's

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,038
really focused on

56
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,680
the mpls label stack and

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,800
[Music]

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
pseudo wire related control word and oem

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
and how those things are

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
going to progress and there's lots of

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,959
lots of

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,640
work going on in that area so if you're

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,400
interested in that topic i suggest you

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
join

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,720
the agenda has not changed since it was

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,040
posted

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,000
we do have a reasonable amount of time

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,760
for each slot i'm going to try to go a

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
little short so

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,080
leave even extra time for more

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,560
discussion

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
as i mentioned yesterday we've added a

73
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,599
new step to our

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,480
itr disclosure process specifically if

75
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,800
you

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
join a as a contributor or as

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,280
a co-author to a working group document

78
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
we ask that you

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,080
make an ipr statement at that time

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,879
uh we reviewed the status of our drafts

81
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,800
yesterday so i'm not going to redo that

82
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
today

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,920
um if there's any questions you know

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
feel free to come on up to the mic or

85
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,840
put it in chat

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,879
um oh i should mention this being asked

87
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,400
for working group adoption

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
this oem framework draft is the first

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
one that's going to be presented

90
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,440
and um so please pay attention

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,200
and uh we still know news on ietf 111

92
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,319
so with that we're going to jump right

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,680
in

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
to oem greg just please make sure to say

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,840
next

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
okay ready okay thank you um

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,480
and let's go to the next slide

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,000
okay so um we've been working on

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
on a document addressing the comments

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
and discussions that we had

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
since uh previous uh 109 meeting

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
and the structure is the same uh what

103
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,639
was

104
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,680
updated is that we added the

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
requirements section

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,440
that previously was a part of

107
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
a working group adopted document on

108
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,840
oem over mpos data plane

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,080
and it

110
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,440
included their section that discusses

111
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,240
the use

112
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,759
of hybrid oem measurement methods

113
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,280
that was part of oem

114
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,500
document in ip

115
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,560
[Applause]

116
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,600
next

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
so uh originally uh we used

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,119
their document that was

119
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,560
spawned from

120
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,720
raw oem support and we discussed it uh

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
in 109 we received updates

122
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,560
and uh that reflects what we've done

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,840
i already mentioned that

124
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,120
no questions okay we can go to the next

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
slide

126
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,600
um so what is a hybrid oem

127
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,680
um rfc 7799

128
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
uh identifies uh defines

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
active and passive so the active uh uses

130
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
the specifically constructed test

131
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
packets

132
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,280
uh to perform measurements and passive

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,479
is that it doesn't have any uh

134
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,479
visible impact on the network

135
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,840
and one example of the passive would be

136
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
snmp or probably

137
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
net constantification um

138
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,960
there are different methods that

139
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,319
has been classified as passive one of

140
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,759
them is a

141
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
uh in a group of onpath telemetry

142
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,800
uh collection iom and alternate marking

143
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,199
method

144
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,800
so the telemetry uh information can be

145
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
uh the process can be separated into two

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,120
uh um sub processes

147
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,319
one is a trigger and originated and the

148
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,960
second

149
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,240
is a collect and transport uh for the

150
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,960
network analytics

151
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,000
iem tracing uh uses two methods

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,919
uh that characterizes end-to-end and hot

153
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,280
by hop

154
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
uh in addition for

155
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
iem tracing is defined

156
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
direct export which every node that

157
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,039
originates telemetry information

158
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,680
exported to the collector

159
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,240
separately and uh another um

160
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,199
mode of collecting transporting was is

161
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,160
proposed

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
and uh discussed in npp and working

163
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,840
group uh it's a hybrid two-step

164
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,199
it is using the follow-up packet that

165
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,360
follows the same path as a trigger

166
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
packet using the same

167
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
encapsulation and collects uh telemetry

168
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
uh why we think it's important to

169
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,520
discuss it because

170
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,080
especially for the net net uh where the

171
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
network resources dedicated to detmet

172
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,520
service

173
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,319
are scarce and precious

174
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
their method of collecting and

175
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
transporting

176
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
on path telemetry is important

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,680
because as you see for iem tracing

178
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,879
uh it it embeds uh the telemetry

179
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,680
information

180
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,400
into the data packet itself into trigger

181
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,440
packet

182
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,400
whereas uh direct export and hybrid

183
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,520
two-step

184
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,440
uh can be transported out of that

185
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,039
even if there follows the same path

186
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,160
but using different class of service

187
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,958
in the network for the hybrid two stack

188
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:33,279
or

189
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,479
being sent out of banned

190
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,519
in terms of the debt net uh using direct

191
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,120
export uh next slide please

192
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,360
and uh another important part that uh

193
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
of the update to this draft

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,360
is the list of the requirements i i

195
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
didn't call we didn't copy the list

196
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,320
itself

197
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,680
so uh there are more requirements we

198
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,839
will try to summarize that will fit in

199
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,240
one

200
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,640
slide so i i don't want to read them

201
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,320
you can look it up and as part of their

202
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,760
meeting materials the slides are there

203
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
so what we emphasize is that

204
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,320
each and every node in that net must uh

205
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,040
be

206
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,360
capable of acting as a

207
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,880
source or addressee of oem session so

208
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,320
act as a map

209
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,600
um the second one um

210
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,560
that's where we have uh some discussion

211
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
among offers

212
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,839
and uh really appreciate your

213
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,839
consideration and

214
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,360
so whether it's a shoot or a must

215
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
that that net oem session

216
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:05,279
originated from the central controller

217
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,399
uh obviously there's important there uh

218
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,399
network failure detection and uh

219
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,279
itf mechanisms uh that could be used the

220
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,079
protocols

221
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,279
uh among them are bfd and being in trace

222
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
route

223
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
uh in-band uh requirement uh

224
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
often um there is a some

225
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
misunderstanding or misconception

226
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,519
that active oem is not necessarily in

227
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,800
bad

228
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,279
um

229
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
by sharing the same encapsulation

230
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,800
of their uh flow that is being monitored

231
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,959
active oem uh is um

232
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,800
in band and so thus uh

233
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,839
we're able to do interpretation of their

234
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,120
failure detection or performance metric

235
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
collected and apply it

236
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,160
to their network analytics

237
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,200
uh another requirement is that

238
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
oem must support one-way measurement

239
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,920
whether it's a one-sided or two-sided

240
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
and uh in case of uh

241
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
two-sided so their uh results can be

242
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
collected out of band

243
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,279
path mtu discovery is important

244
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,110
so as a packet replication

245
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,440
[Music]

246
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
duplicate elimination and water

247
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,199
preservation function

248
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
and because this is a very dead net

249
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,360
specific

250
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,600
it's something that we are planning to

251
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
take uh

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
charge and uh have a proposal

253
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,160
probably by the next meeting

254
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
and the protection switch over so that's

255
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
something that needs to be discussed

256
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
in terms whether it's an end-to-end

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
protection or it's a local protection

258
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,599
and the next slide

259
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,240
that this um uh this slide and this

260
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,680
section of the document

261
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,839
we didn't get a lot of attention as we

262
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,079
do adoption and i'll just remind people

263
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,240
that they can make their uh comment on

264
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,920
the list and say they want it addressed

265
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,600
as part of the working group process it

266
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
doesn't have to block adoption just

267
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,360
because you disagree with one of these

268
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
points but it is good you express your

269
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,120
view

270
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,160
during adoption thank you

271
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
uh what i wanted to stress is

272
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
because

273
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,880
now working group documents such as

274
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,160
defnet oem in mpls with

275
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,959
mpls data plane and another document

276
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,000
with ip data

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
plane uh they uh

278
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
referenced the requirements and now they

279
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,600
reference

280
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
this document so we

281
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,720
by moving this um list of document to

282
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
its more logical place in the oem

283
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
framework in the devnet

284
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,560
uh created the dependency so it's a

285
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
really much appreciated consideration of

286
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,279
adopting this working

287
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,199
this work by their debt networking group

288
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:49,839
and then progressing it further

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,880
okay thank you

290
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,839
thank you greg and um i i like

291
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,920
the approach actually and as you said

292
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
now the the this would be an oem

293
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,720
framework at that point framework

294
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,920
and uh to which the mpls om and the

295
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,519
ipym could refer to this one would

296
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,639
specify the common aspects for that

297
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,880
notorious

298
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,199
thank you

299
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,560
comments anyone want to

300
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,120
come into line we have a minute or two i

301
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
think it's really useful to get

302
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,519
um any objections to adopting this

303
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,160
document

304
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
normally if we were in person we would

305
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,240
do our usual poll but it's a little hard

306
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
um on meat echo but getting objections

307
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
is not

308
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,320
um so if if i may

309
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,040
uh i don't know if uh

310
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
that um uses this uh

311
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,279
hands tool that is in the mythical

312
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,000
i'd like to just um ask people if they

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,199
have objections because

314
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,240
um if we if we uh do the tool and ask

315
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,600
for objections we don't know what the

316
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,959
objection is so i

317
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,079
i really i think we'd prefer to hear

318
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,360
what the objection is whether that

319
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
someone types it um

320
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,320
in jabber or says it at a mic

321
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,079
i think those are good now of course we

322
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,199
are going to do this on the list so

323
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
there's always an opportunity there

324
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
personally i actually have some

325
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,160
technical comments on the document but i

326
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,199
don't think it blocks

327
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,240
adoption um so i'll make those comments

328
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,720
during

329
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,399
the adoption call and we'll address them

330
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,759
during work normal working group

331
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,880
processing

332
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
but if someone has an objection probably

333
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
a strong one it'd be great to hear

334
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,880
hear from them

335
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,759
all right well uh thank you very much

336
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,560
for this work

337
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,839
and we should expect to see an adoption

338
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,040
call on the list

339
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,880
and hopefully get some good comments

340
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,920
uh moving to next

341
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,079
i think we have control planes bring

342
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:23,839
that up

343
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,120

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,680

please

350
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,600
yeah thanks that's the an update to the

351
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,959
uh we presented the first version of

352
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,920
this in the uh

353
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
in a 109 and in the interviews meeting

354
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,360
in december

355
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
uh we had discussions um particularly in

356
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,040
the rings meeting on

357
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,279
what we intend to you know the focus of

358
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,320
the draft to be

359
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,040
uh and and i highlighted the keywords

360
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
here that are copied from the

361
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,440
um from from from the abstract which

362
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,119
means we are proposing changes to

363
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,240
rcp and surf um for a better alignment

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,280
with ours

365
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,480
with tsn we called it rsvp

366
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,760
um dash tsn in the document uh

367
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
and that means we're limiting the scope

368
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,880
of the draft to

369
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,199
uh to those changes we had a bit of

370
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,480
discussion in the interview on whether

371
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,400
or not this this would have a broader

372
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,280
scope

373
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,359
to something like rsvp.net which we

374
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,559
initially planned

375
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,400
but we kind of focused this down to the

376
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,280
tsn part um initially but that doesn't

377
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
limit us to maybe go for

378
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
an accompanying exercise for um you know

379
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
other changes to rsvp but we wanted to

380
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,039
start with that

381
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,120
go to the next draft please oh next

382
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,840
slide please

383
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,160
um at the end or as you go

384
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,840
so next slide please

385
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,520
have we changed the slide i can't see an

386
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,840
update

387
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,559

the structure slide i think there was a

393
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,000
slide in between um though

394
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,400
oh no that's that's that's the one yeah

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,400
audio problems i must have had a

398
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,080
connection problem there for a moment

399
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
i apologize okay um uh thanks no no

400
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
we're on the right one we're on the

401
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
right when we're on

402
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,320
okay um one question do you want um

403
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,520
comments as we go

404
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
or do you want comments at the end oh

405
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,760
yeah that was the question i didn't

406
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,720
really quite get

407
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,760
i'm fine i'm fine either way um i i i

408
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
heard something about end but

409
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,200
that must have been when you had audio

410
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,880
problems yeah okay

411
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,120
let's just take it at the end keep going

412
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,880
please sorry okay

413
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
thanks so we we we clarified the use

414
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,000
cases as a change from the last version

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,320
we now present two use cases what i

416
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,919
would call a hybrid.net over to your

417
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,440
center where customer network

418
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
the difference is that we have in in one

419
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,760
case a

420
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,559
a core network with rsvp support and the

421
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,600
other ones

422
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
we don't that's a difference in the use

423
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,640
cases

424
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,760
um section three is now focused on the

425
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,080
design rationale which are the former

426
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
sections two two two three two five so

427
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,320
we merged them into a new section

428
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,280
um and then a focal section four on the

429
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,240
rsvp

430
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,360
uh tsn uh proposal

431
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,080
which uh took the layer into actions

432
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,840
revised from the previous version so

433
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
it's it's a revised part but it's

434
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,520
largely taken from from

435
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,159
the previous draft and we also changed

436
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,480
the api descriptions to align with

437
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,520
the terminology which was another

438
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
comment we received so in the structure

439
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,799
if you go to the next slide please

440
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,400
yeah thanks so section two is are the

441
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,200
use cases

442
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
um also there we revise and learn the

443
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,720
terminology as a

444
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,520
request um design rationale section

445
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,559
three as i mentioned

446
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,159
before and then uh section four

447
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
is is it's the proposed design which

448
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,240
which has the layer interaction

449
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,880
uh the the interactions the the api

450
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,400
descriptions

451
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
uh and the message formats will come in

452
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,559
the next version we didn't finish them

453
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,640
in time for the deadline um so that's

454
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
the last subsection of

455
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,200
uh section four i don't know why the

456
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
numbers went wrong that's obviously not

457
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,080
section seven there but

458
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,200
never mind that's at the end um if you

459
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,080
go to the next slide please

460
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
so the we've received feedback both in

461
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,440
the in the

462
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
in the uh 109 but also the interviews

463
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
meeting here that we tried to address in

464
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,480
the new version so

465
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,760
the the scenario was uh the one

466
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,679
you know what type of scenario we had

467
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,600
that's why we revised the

468
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,960
use case section to provide their

469
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,440
hopefully a clearer example um we

470
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,200
clarified the relation to the

471
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,679
to the tsn specific data plane drafts by

472
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,400
providing revised api descriptions

473
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
in section four also clarified the use

474
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,880
of the flow information model by

475
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,400
aligning the terminology

476
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
in those api descriptions again and also

477
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
did a scrub

478
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
hope that we caught most of the things

479
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
where we had misalignments

480
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
across the sections where we were

481
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,159
diverging from the terminology

482
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,080
thanks to the next one please

483
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,720
so the next steps i'd like to do is to

484
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,840
fill in the message formats and the

485
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,360
protocol information

486
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
as i didn't get that done in time um

487
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,600
and obviously uh would like to

488
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,400
seek more input from the list potential

489
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,760
which brings me to the last slide if you

490
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
can just jump to that one

491
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,640
already which means we would like to

492
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,600
hear feedback

493
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,600
comments potentially anybody who's

494
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
yeah um

500
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,480

501
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,679
yang

502
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,559
on monday does this brand intend to

503
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,039
cover

504
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,720
all of the deer playing scenarios that

505
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,880
were outlined in that yang presentation

506
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,360
no we haven't we haven't reviewed that

507
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,120
yet i i noticed that yesterday i sent a

508
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,559
note to my co-authors as well

509
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,559
to to have a good look at that um they

510
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,919
they they couldn't make it to the

511
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:00,400
meeting

512
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,960
um so i can't tell you okay let me

513
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,159
suggest that the the

514
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,679
the presentation material did a really

515
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,159
nice job on covering all the various

516
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,720
uh data planes uh that would work it'd

517
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,200
be great

518
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,080
rsvp covered all of those and as part of

519
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,159
that could i suggest you find an acronym

520
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,559
other than tsm which is going to

521
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,679
going to create some bad uh implications

522
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,440
about which data planes this applies to

523
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,320
okay thanks

524
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,200
i'd like to follow up on that comment

525
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,880
even though i'm cue jumping in this blue

526
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,159
the the document is really is focused on

527
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,080
inner working of a debt net rsvp

528
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,200
with tsn um so

529
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,080
unlike david i think your your the title

530
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,279
is appropriate because you really are

531
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,480
limited there

532
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,840
um but i'm going to go back to a comment

533
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
that i believe we made at the last

534
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
couple times that you've talked about

535
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,880
this draft is

536
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
we don't have a definition of what rsvp

537
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
looks like for

538
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,200
debt net in general and that's for

539
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
all the use cases that david just talked

540
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
about where for ip

541
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,919
um for mpls for aggregation we don't

542
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,760
know what that looks like and there's a

543
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,039
a large body of work we can build on

544
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,080
in particular the traffic engineering

545
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,000
extensions to rsvp and i know that

546
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,120
you're not building on those you're

547
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,480
building on inserve

548
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
so you know what's your thought about

549
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,919
addressing

550
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,960
these base capabilities um

551
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,080
uh from the comment before from david's

552
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,520
comment as well as from

553
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,960
uh previous meetings yeah so

554
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
when we discussed about how to move

555
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,480
forward uh because the camera

556
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
as you as you said was made during the

557
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
last meeting uh uh

558
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,480
to go for an rsvp deadnet we found the

559
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,159
the access at least for us for the for

560
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,840
the authors that we had

561
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,320
too large so we honed it down to tsn but

562
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,520
i do agree and but that was the

563
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,200
discussion we had in the last meeting

564
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,960
but there's a whole body of work to be

565
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
done on

566
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,360
that net view and rsvp if you if you

567
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,400
will

568
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,919
but it's probably that we didn't want to

569
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,760
take that on so hence we hung ourselves

570
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,279
down into this end but it's a little bit

571
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,760
kind of avoiding the work but um i think

572
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
it's maybe also starting the work so we

573
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
wanted to be concrete from the

574
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,840
from the tsn angle and can then maybe

575
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,640
reopen

576
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
you know that body of work or that

577
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,240
discussion once you know

578
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
we move forward if you will right so

579
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,840
that was that was a little bit i would

580
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
compromise in a way

581
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,520
okay well with um sort of chair hat on

582
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,760
my perspective is follow david black's

583
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,240
guidance

584
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,880
bellage you're in queue yes

585
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,799
this is also what i wanted to highlight

586
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,799
so i i think thank you very much for the

587
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:45,679
update

588
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,919
uh based on that it is much more clear

589
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,640
what was your focus with this draft

590
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,600
um and uh i i would like to join the

591
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,240
previous comments that

592
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,640
the title might be misleading because

593
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,240
what you are focusing

594
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,320
here is uh if rsvp is used for that net

595
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
signaling

596
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,679
and you are using graph for tsn

597
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,400
signaling

598
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
how these control plane signaling uh can

599
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,760
interact in a sub network scenario

600
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,840
so i think that is your use case and

601
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,919
this is pretty well described in the

602
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:20,720
updated

603
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,760
draft so thanks for that but i think

604
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,799
also that

605
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,320
this is something that must be

606
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,640
highlighted in the title as well

607
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
that you have a special focus on a

608
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,840
special scenario

609
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,720
and not solving the control plane

610
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,679
signaling for

611
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,760
that net yeah that's that's that

612
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,159
that's a fair point we left we left the

613
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,919
title of the draft there which probably

614
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:44,720
wasn't

615
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,080
the best thing to do instead of

616
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,320
reflecting the actual focus in the draft

617
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,080
um so that one i do agree with

618
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,720
i said i mean there is an interest to

619
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,760
come back i mean i

620
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,760
discussed this with the with my um

621
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,960
courses

622
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,640
to to look at you know the larger

623
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,480
problem still of control plane signaling

624
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,039
um

625
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,480
uh you know but it would be

626
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,159
i see this as a body work that probably

627
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,640
goes beyond um the competences that we

628
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,360
the three of us have uh and that's why

629
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,480
in the meantime we would probably like

630
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:12,960
to just

631
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,919
stick to it we can just reflect that by

632
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,600
narrowing also the

633
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,840
scope clearly in the title and renaming

634
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,720
the title

635
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,640
but certainly being interested in

636
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,080
addressing the

637
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,000
uh conor open signaling problem at some

638
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,039
point as contributors

639
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,399
okay all right david

640
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,399
the obvious question if the draft scope

641
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,000
is limited to

642
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,520
uh if rsvp is used for detnit then this

643
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
is how it works in tsn

644
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,720
um do do the folks involved have

645
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,600
running code for rsvp insert for net

646
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,559
sorry i didn't i didn't catch the

647
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,720
question i had an audio issue

648
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,399
even prototype of rsvp int serve

649
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,399
for dead net i think your draft is

650
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,520
assuming this works

651
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:16,320
that's an interesting assumption

652
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,279
um yes sorry i i again i had a hiccup a

653
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,559
dropout somewhere but uh

654
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,559
what i said from the question is yes

655
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,320
that's that's what we do

656
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,399
okay but dude do you have running code

657
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,760
for rsvp for

658
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,080
for rsvp int serve for get net

659
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
let me check that with my co-authors

660
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,919
yeah i advise checking it because i

661
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:36,320
think that

662
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,880
the question is lurking in here is it is

663
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,440
a very convenient assumption

664
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,120
uh and it'll be nice if it were true

665
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,880
that rsvp int serve

666
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,399
can work for debt net um

667
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,559
that really ought to be ought to be

668
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,440
sanity checked

669
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,919
somehow

670
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,080
yep thanks

671
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
uh yamash is in queue so i'm guessing

672
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
he's coming as a contributor

673
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,520
please yes yes i have uh have similar

674
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,279
concern like uh

675
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,720
the previous speakers said that sort of

676
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,679
uh

677
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,919
the basis would be to figure out how

678
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,640
rsvp works for that

679
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,760
on its own and then we can think of

680
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,000
integration with tsa and without having

681
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,080
the basic stuff

682
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,480
it's it's hard to see uh or how to do

683
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,520
the work i think

684
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,120
i understand you want to narrow your

685
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,080
focus but um

686
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
yeah i think youngest i are about the

687
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,120
same page

688
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,039
um not not clear that rsvp in surf

689
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,600
uh uh for detonate is the proverbial

690
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,960
right thing to do although i do

691
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,919
understand the

692
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,320
the concern about massive massive

693
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,840
expansion of scope of your work

694
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,200
i think we're running out of time

695
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,720
so we'll move on

696
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,159
i i do think if you are looking at this

697
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,240
work and expanding it or looking at make

698
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
sure you have a good foundation it is

699
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,360
important to look at the

700
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,240
te varieties of rsvp i think you'll find

701
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,520
that they bring a lot to the table

702
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,279
i would secondly comment because right

703
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,520
now the only active work on and use of

704
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,880
rsvp is pe

705
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,080
not not in surf

706
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,919
and with that we're going to move on to

707
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,960
uh microburst young peng

708
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,320
um if you would

709
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,720
come to the mic find your slides

710
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,960
yes um just make sure to say next when

711
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,240
you're ready for the next slide

712
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,080
please go ahead okay thank you

713
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,120
this is a talk about uh microburst

714
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,080
and i'm tong hongduo from china mobile

715
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,120
and next please

716
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,000
it's the second version and we get some

717
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,080
feedback and make some modifications

718
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,960
first we change the statement that the

719
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,840
large-scale sp network is not in scope

720
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
and it's because

721
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,840
the net is good for single the meteor

722
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,480
administrative domain which could be

723
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,600
small or large and we also change those

724
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,480
leaders to

725
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,600
the information now because our key

726
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,559
issue is not

727
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,760
and the implementation

728
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,799
of a cooling mechanism but

729
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,000
is a new explanation

730
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,120
exploration to provide this

731
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,399
low latency service and we

732
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,640
add some explanation about the

733
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
motivation

734
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,200
and the way to decrease the microburst

735
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,320
several new sections are added

736
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,159
next please

737
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,960
um one comment about i'm sorry for the

738
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,840
delay uh

739
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,880
one comment on on the slide

740
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
you say dettnet has scoped a single

741
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,559
administrative domain

742
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,679
um it also can support a closed group of

743
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,360
administrative control

744
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,039
so it could um include um

745
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,840
cooperating administrative domains so i

746
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,559
think you

747
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,720
yours your comment there that sub-bullet

748
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,799
is not aligned with our charter so just

749
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,880
be aware of that

750
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,640
okay about correctly thank you

751
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,039
thank you

752
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,440
this page about what we want to show

753
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,360
in this craft in our opinion

754
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,080
the currently the test mechanism are too

755
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,880
communicated to deploy in large-scale sp

756
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,480
networks

757
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,760
we have analysis many

758
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,399
problems the conclusion

759
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,200
of conclusion is that nowadays we are

760
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,840
short of a common and a simple method to

761
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,720
provide

762
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,120
this loneliness service in large-scale

763
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,200
sp networks

764
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,600
and our method mentioned in the draft

765
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,679
show a potential solution

766
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,559
that is both simple and scalable

767
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,440
meanwhile

768
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,519
it does not need the type factorization

769
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,840
we think that perhaps it can benefit

770
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,200
some low latency service providing

771
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,360
in large scale sp networks

772
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,840
next page please

773
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,919
this page about the mechanism

774
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,120
in our draft

775
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,399
have several preconditions uh the first

776
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,520
one is that

777
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,760
uh critical traffic in the network

778
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,800
should have

779
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
a higher uh priority and the second

780
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,480
is that uh how enough finding values

781
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,839
resolved

782
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,719
so that there should be enough analyse

783
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,280
for them

784
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,040
on the interface uh so we think that

785
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,719
they should know both in the

786
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,520
network and in this case the main

787
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,879
problem is

788
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,079
to decrease the microburst uh

789
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,679
in our mechanism uh we it uses

790
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,879
uh flow shipping on the edge and

791
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,918
on the intermediate nodes we do the

792
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,199
interface graduated shipping we change

793
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,960
the regular behavior

794
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,599
or on the router uh it is to say that

795
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,599
the router following all the traffic as

796
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,680
soon as possible

797
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,880
in our maximum we use the

798
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,200
shipping method in the tsn so that

799
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,400
the traffic will be forwarded in

800
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,680
out of the way next week please

801
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,000
we also give some analysis about the

802
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,480
purpose method

803
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,280
when we compare comparing and with the

804
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,040
traditional ip forwarding

805
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
uh with the priority in a relatively

806
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,400
light loading

807
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,520
network uh our mechanism can offer a

808
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,680
better folding for the rotated low

809
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,359
latency traffic

810
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,800
with lights microburst and of course we

811
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
have some cause

812
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,920
the cost of shipping on the on the edge

813
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,240
and keeping the shipping result on the

814
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,560
intermediate nodes

815
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,240
comparing the cancer mechanism

816
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,439
our mechanism is

817
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,520
simpler and more scalable

818
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,960
of course we have some disadvantage

819
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,560
is about the uh uncertainty everything

820
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,359
that in our maximum uncertainty perhaps

821
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,640
is higher

822
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,680
um but

823
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,040
okay when the uncertainty is higher

824
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,440
perhaps some of the final use case

825
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,800
cannot be exported in our mechanism

826
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,760
next page please

827
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,680
this page is about the work at the a

828
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,320
step

829
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,280
we will try and find whether some of the

830
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,440
uh that net use case can be supported in

831
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,800
certain conditions

832
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,760
uh we think that for example uh in a

833
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,040
network that

834
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,560
the critical traffic is not too much or

835
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,640
low density traffic is not that critical

836
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,920
and the perhaps the the first step

837
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,920
the loaded traffic the note that

838
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,960
critical will be

839
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,160
would appear in the large scale as

840
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,680
united workforce and we also think about

841
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,560
uh

842
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,720
to do this uh approximate

843
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,560
evaluation of the society we need to

844
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:20,960
check

845
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,760
whether the mechanism we can work can

846
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,720
work for those

847
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,560
low latency traffic they are not was

848
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,000
that critical

849
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,240
and we think that the

850
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,400
replication and elimination method in

851
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,079
testing can have because

852
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,640
in our mechanism perhaps we cannot

853
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,599
ensure that

854
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,920
a hundred percent uh losses

855
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,040
this packed replication of the

856
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,560
elimination private hype to grow some

857
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,000
uh packets that have lost

858
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,760
the network and

859
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,280
this is the last page i think uh

860
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,640
if if uh if you have any problem

861
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,279
in any question you can talk now

862
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,839
thank you thank you

863
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,880
david can you go ahead yeah so

864
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,440
looking at the description of this uh

865
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,320
the approach looks a lot like diffserv

866
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,920
where the flows are individually policed

867
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,200
at the edge and then there's a flow

868
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,160
aggregate traffic traffic conditioning

869
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
conditioning in the core

870
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,640
the scalability comments are definitely

871
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,320
on the mark is that that was one of the

872
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,079
reasons that diffserv was designed the

873
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,800
way it is

874
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,599
i'd encourage of the authors to take a

875
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:53,920
look

876
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,119
at a diffserv framework uh that'd be uh

877
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,839
rfc uh 2475

878
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,480
place to start

879
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,759
thank you

880
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,400
any other questions comments

881
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,040
yeah personally i think this is

882
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,640
interesting work and we look forward to

883
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,920
you know seeing how it

884
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,079
uh evolves i don't know if there's any

885
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,680
other comments if there's not we're

886
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,079
going to move on

887
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,240
thank you very much thank you

888
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,560
i think yaakov is up next

889
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,760
i think so as well uh how's my audio

890
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,119
it's okay please go ahead just say next

891
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:52,240
when you're ready

892
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,160
i understand that that's what has to be

893
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,720
done maybe one day meet echo will have a

894
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,480
button for us to push to move someone

895
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,359
else's slides hi everyone jakob stein

896
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,000
it's nice to be back in the itf after a

897
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,800
long time

898
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,160
next next slide please

899
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,520
the reason i haven't been coming to the

900
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,000
itf for a long time is i've been wasting

901
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,119
my time with uh

902
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,480
5g exhale transport

903
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,720
and i really could use this time to plug

904
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,560
a book which just came out but i won't

905
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,440
do so

906
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,119
um there are problems having to do

907
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,079
with delays i'm sure you all know uh

908
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,119
when doing

909
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,920
uh backhaul of mobile and it's gotten

910
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,720
much worse in 5g

911
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,599
and people have thought that perhaps tsn

912
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,560
or detnit mechanisms are

913
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,680
can be adapted to solve this problem

914
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,200
and it turns out it doesn't work very

915
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,440
well uh in particular i'm talking about

916
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,640
qbv which i realize

917
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,040
is not a death net it's more of a tsn

918
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,280
approach but i have to define my first

919
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,800
line here

920
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,119
the mechanism i'm talking about is for

921
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,680
what i call a time sensitive packet flow

922
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,560
where i mean by time sensitive simply

923
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,520
that

924
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
the packets have to be delivered within

925
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,520
um

926
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,760
only a little bit more than the

927
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,119
physically possible

928
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,359
minimal time uh to get through the

929
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,560
network

930
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,640
and when you try to use mechanisms that

931
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,400
do time gating

932
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,119
it turns out that they don't scale and

933
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:23,680
if you

934
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,280
actually try to give an upper bound the

935
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
upper bound is much higher

936
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,960
than what is physical physically

937
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,119
possible and if you don't

938
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,960
plan it correctly and it's almost

939
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
impossible to play it correctly

940
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,599
the efficiency on the line goes down

941
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,359
and we're wondering if there is a

942
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:40,880
mechanism that doesn't

943
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,000
suffer from all of these problems

944
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,520
and it's interesting by the way that the

945
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,800
802.1 people themselves the tsn people

946
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,000
in their cm document for exalt um

947
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,920
recommend frame preemption but don't

948
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,920
recommend their own mechanism

949
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,119
uh for for this this case

950
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,839
and uh which i think is basically

951
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,520
because it doesn't scale very well

952
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,800
can i have the next slide please

953
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,480
uh just before i introduce what i want

954
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,960
to talk about i just want to

955
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,920
give a model for the forwarder which

956
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,599
from now on i'll call router although it

957
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,000
could be a switch an sdn switch

958
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,119
an mpls lsr or whatever you want

959
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,119
but basically i'm talking about a

960
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,119
forwarding device which has

961
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,079
two parts forwarding logic which takes

962
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,560
the

963
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,720
packet and decides which output port it

964
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,319
has to go to

965
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,880
and scheduling logic which decides which

966
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,119
packet of all those packets

967
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,040
that have to be transmitted over the

968
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,520
output port should be first

969
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,599
uh and i just want to mention that when

970
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,520
you think about it in terms of segment

971
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,680
routing and tsn or deathnet rather than

972
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,280
saying which port

973
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,560
and which packet to send over that port

974
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,119
you can think of it as where to send the

975
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,040
packet and when to send the packet in

976
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,480
other words forwarding is basically

977
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,359
saying

978
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,440
given this packet it just arrived where

979
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,560
should i send it

980
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,200
and scheduling says when should i send

981
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,079
it and when

982
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,720
means something when you have your

983
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,680
network elements

984
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,800
all synced up to a common clock next

985
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,119
please

986
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,319
so what am i proposing i'm proposing an

987
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,599
alternative to using qbv

988
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,720
and similar mechanisms that relies on

989
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,200
using

990
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,319
a stack data structure uh added to the

991
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,920
packet in the packet headers

992
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,000
i'll mention in a moment what has to be

993
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,200
in that stack

994
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,560
there are two options um one is only for

995
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,480
the scheduling problem once one for the

996
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,839
both for the forwarding and the

997
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,599
scheduling problem

998
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:47,200
uh and the nice thing about this

999
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
alternative is that it can be

1000
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
optimized in a scalable way

1001
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,760
it can its configuration can be um

1002
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,599
adapted in other words you can add a new

1003
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:58,240
flow

1004
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,119
without having to uh start touching a

1005
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,880
lot of network elements a lot of routers

1006
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,839
in the network

1007
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,400
uh during which time you'll have

1008
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,680
inconsistencies and uh

1009
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,480
and you might have uh uh packed quote uh

1010
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,400
either be lost or fail to meet their

1011
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
deadlines

1012
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,200
and it can get down to very very close

1013
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,599
to the physical delay

1014
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,800
and um the uh

1015
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,520
mechanism using a stack it has sort of

1016
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,680
an analogy with segment routing

1017
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,079
uh i spoke about this yesterday in

1018
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,720
spring

1019
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,240
and there some people said it's not

1020
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,079
really segment routing

1021
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,359
uh however i want to uh uh claim

1022
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,839
uh that it's a kind of it's it's uh

1023
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,599
analogous to segment routing

1024
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,440
and we'll see why in a moment next slide

1025
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,680
please

1026
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,480
okay so to explain to you why i need a

1027
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
stack let's talk about two

1028
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,240
known ways to reduce end to end

1029
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,920
propagation delay without doing

1030
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,079
gating and things of that sort one is

1031
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,920
called longest in system

1032
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,319
in which you insert into a packet it's

1033
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,079
birth time that is the time

1034
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,920
either it leaves the host or enters the

1035
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,359
network

1036
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,839
and you prioritize packets based on the

1037
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,720
birth time

1038
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,400
earlier packets get sent first but

1039
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,319
obviously this is sub-optimal

1040
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,800
because a packet which has been a long

1041
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,160
time in the system but doesn't have a

1042
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,440
very tight budget

1043
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,640
would be prioritized over a packet which

1044
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,280
actually

1045
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,000
is almost has its budget used up but it

1046
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,480
hasn't been that long in the system

1047
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,240
so you might decide let's use what's

1048
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,839
called earliest deadline

1049
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,560
first or edf and that simply puts the

1050
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,119
packet's

1051
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,720
deadline the absolute time that it's

1052
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,000
supposed to reach the other end of the

1053
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,200
network or the final

1054
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,960
host um and that sounds better it is

1055
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,800
better however

1056
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,200
that obviously prioritizes packets with

1057
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,880
an earlier final dead time

1058
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,000
uh deadline in each router along the way

1059
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
uh without knowing how far it is from

1060
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,200
this router

1061
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,400
to the final uh destination so

1062
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,640
uh you might have a case where you are

1063
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,680
prioritizing

1064
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,599
a packet which is just has one more hop

1065
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,000
to go over another packet which has

1066
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,240
um uh which looks like it has more time

1067
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,760
but actually has a long

1068
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,000
a large number of routers to get to

1069
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,200
traverse

1070
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,440
so both lis and edf and many other

1071
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,800
variations where you put

1072
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,960
one time into the pocket aren't good

1073
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,079
enough

1074
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,960
next slide please

1075
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,200
so the idea is to put a stack of

1076
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,800
deadlines when i say a stack

1077
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,880
i simply mean a list where you see the

1078
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,200
top of stack and you pop it each time

1079
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,640
and that stack element has the absolute

1080
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,119
time

1081
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,359
that the packet should leave the present

1082
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,520
router so if for each router you

1083
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,560
traverse

1084
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,599
uh you pop the top of the stack you look

1085
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,800
at that time and you do

1086
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,760
some kind of scheduling which might be

1087
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,720
edf

1088
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,599
or just in time or something i call pedf

1089
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,440
look at the draft

1090
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,240
or any other mechanism and of course you

1091
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,079
need some mechanism for figuring out

1092
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,599
these deadlines i'm going to show you

1093
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,280
one in the next slide which i mentioned

1094
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,720
the draft but certainly not

1095
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,040
the only mechanism and i refer to other

1096
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,440
ones in the draft as well

1097
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,720
three minutes uh okay um of course this

1098
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,800
requires something more complex in the

1099
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,720
router than a simple fifo q

1100
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,720
per qos like is normally done in a

1101
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,000
router or a switch

1102
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,800
however i think it's less complex than

1103
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,760
using time

1104
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,280
sensitive gates time scheduling gates

1105
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,160
next slide please

1106
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,880
and why do i say it is analogous to

1107
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,079
segment routing because if i'm

1108
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,119
already putting a stack which has an

1109
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,280
entry for every router to be traversed

1110
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,319
into the packet i might as well combine

1111
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,680
it with segment routing

1112
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,079
and have both the forwarding decisions

1113
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
and the scheduling decisions in the same

1114
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,280
stack in other words i put

1115
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,599
i can put a stack in where every entry

1116
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:56,480
in the stack has

1117
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,960
two sub entries one a forwarding sub

1118
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,079
entry basically

1119
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,400
where do you send the packet and one is

1120
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,280
scheduling

1121
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,359
sub entry which says when to send the

1122
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,319
packet

1123
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,160
uh so when you do this you pop the the

1124
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,240
each router pops the top of stock

1125
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,559
and knows both where to send and when to

1126
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,800
send the packet

1127
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,960
um this can be combined with best effort

1128
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,520
traffic with strict priority and you can

1129
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,079
even have

1130
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,040
several priorities of time sensitive

1131
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,000
packets

1132
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,800
next slide please

1133
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,280
here's a simple example to give you the

1134
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,200
idea

1135
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
why these numbers are what they are you

1136
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,800
can see in the draft

1137
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,559
however the idea is the host in this

1138
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,559
case i'm do using it like in segment

1139
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,559
routing rather like in sort routing

1140
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,680
source routing so you actually see

1141
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,880
the header which is being inserted

1142
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,040
only after the first router and it has

1143
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,240
the number of

1144
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,119
entries as the number of routers minus

1145
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,000
one

1146
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,240
but basically you will see the stock

1147
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,000
there the srtsn stack

1148
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,480
if you're doing both where you have both

1149
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,359
the forwarding

1150
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,160
sub entry and the scheduling sub entry

1151
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,119
and each time

1152
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,880
one is popped until you get to the final

1153
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,359
one and you can even save a bit

1154
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,559
uh by uh having a special code for a

1155
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,160
for bottom of stock rather than wasting

1156
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,000
a bit but that's we don't really have to

1157
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,880
go into that right

1158
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,559
now next slide please i realize i only

1159
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,760
have one minute

1160
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,480
um i was asked to talk a little bit

1161
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,400
about how much room this takes if you're

1162
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,760
thinking of

1163
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,720
128-bit ipv6 addresses and 64-bit

1164
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,480
timestamps this would sound

1165
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,000
like it would take a tremendous amount

1166
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,920
of room but not so

1167
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,800
you can actually make do with much many

1168
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,720
fewer bits

1169
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,800
actually i didn't give you one extra bit

1170
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,400
here because if you do that trick i

1171
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,920
mentioned before but the bottom of stock

1172
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,000
you don't need that plus one at the end

1173
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,200
but you actually in many cases uh

1174
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,359
for the kinds of networks where this is

1175
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,480
important where you have

1176
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,040
several hundred routers and the maximum

1177
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,720
amount of time that a packet can go

1178
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:01,359
through the

1179
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,480
network um is uh on the order of

1180
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,520
milliseconds

1181
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,599
this can end up being 16 bits or maybe

1182
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,119
32 bits if you're really

1183
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,040
going to squander them which means that

1184
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,599
between four and eight hops only require

1185
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,359
as much room as a single ipv6 address

1186
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:22,319
next slide please and to sum up

1187
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,800
what i'm asking from this working group

1188
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,640
and i asked something similar to this

1189
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,960
spring working group and i was going to

1190
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,720
ask pce as well

1191
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,160
but they didn't get me into their

1192
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,720
schedule is where should this work be

1193
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,200
done

1194
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,599
it is similar it has elements of segment

1195
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:38,319
routing it has

1196
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,520
elements of time sensitivity uh of the

1197
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,800
ditnet variety

1198
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
and of course requires an optimization

1199
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,160
algorithm and

1200
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,400
by the way uh it was interesting to hear

1201
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,319
just before about rsvp

1202
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,880
i also have a non-centralized mechanism

1203
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,319
where you don't have to do measurement

1204
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,040
of the

1205
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,440
link delays ahead of time but rather

1206
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,800
send an rsvp

1207
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,280
like packet ahead of actually several of

1208
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,640
them and measure the

1209
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,119
the acquire timestamps and sort of

1210
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,800
measure the delays as you go

1211
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,760
but simply i'm asking for the chairs uh

1212
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,319
to

1213
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,119
coordinate where and if they want this

1214
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,240
work to progress

1215
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,319
and of course if there's interest uh in

1216
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,839
this work at all

1217
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,760
that's it okay we didn't leave time for

1218
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,680
questions um because we do have one more

1219
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,280
slot and we're rapidly running out of

1220
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,839
time

1221
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,680
uh we'll take the action to coordinate

1222
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,119
so absolutely

1223
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,880
and it seems like there's some interest

1224
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,559
because we've got good discussion on the

1225
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,920
list which is always nice to see on a

1226
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,880
new draft

1227
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,079
with that we're going to move to the

1228
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,319
last presenter excuse me

1229
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,680
by the way thank you yaakov for showing

1230
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,078
back up

1231
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,520
hello we hear you just fine

1232
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,920
and your slides are up so please proceed

1233
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,200
thank you

1234
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,400
thank you this is john

1235
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,280
speaking i'm going to introduce a

1236
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:13,920
problem

1237
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,599
statement about queuing magnesium

1238
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,720
with multiple cyclic buffer i have

1239
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,440
submitted the draft

1240
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,079
next please

1241
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,079
the previous experts

1242
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,559
has introduced the method of guarantee

1243
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:39,119
deterministic services from different

1244
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,359
angle this draft

1245
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,559
focus on the keying magnesium

1246
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,839
of cyclic q and forwarding to

1247
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:53,599
guarantees and to understand

1248
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,280
the abundant literacy draft

1249
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,559
already have already described

1250
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:03,760
the requirement about it for

1251
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,960
given that that night clients of

1252
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,640
services there are a site of

1253
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,359
two or more passwords provided under the

1254
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:14,319
output key

1255
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:18,000
layer next please

1256
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,839
the i triple isoe 802.1

1257
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,960
qsage has defined

1258
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,319
the two by four seven key

1259
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,599
to buffer for output

1260
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:40,800
and the finger and the left finger shoe

1261
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,000
all nodes keep the same cycle starting

1262
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,200
time

1263
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,559
the packets send by upstream node

1264
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,640
and circle x must be received by node b

1265
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,520
under the same cycle uh in a cyclex

1266
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,359
node a send all pancakes in the buffer

1267
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,559
to node b in the same cycle x node we

1268
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:04,960
use

1269
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,000
above or to accumulate

1270
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,559
all pancakes from e at the same time

1271
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,760
the node b sends out the pancake then

1272
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,880
have already been buffered in cycle

1273
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,359
x minus one in the next cycle

1274
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,480
x plus 1 the node b will

1275
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,680
send will send out of the pancake then

1276
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,800
are received

1277
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,960
from node a in cycle x therefore

1278
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,079
if the pancreate transfers um

1279
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,400
h port h hopes the maximum literacy is

1280
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,079
h plus one times uh tc

1281
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,760
what is what is tctc is the buffer of a

1282
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,280
cycle

1283
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,119
and the the minimum let's see is h

1284
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:58,880
is a h minus 1

1285
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,240
times t c the g abundant

1286
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,040
is 2 times t c

1287
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,640
as a great square it's

1288
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,200
that the that time in circle x

1289
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,160
which is used to identify different

1290
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,440
cycle

1291
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,480
the link propagation delay

1292
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,200
should be observed by a cycle

1293
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,919
next please

1294
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,880
the problem statement statement of

1295
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,160
two buffers qf

1296
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,200
is presented

1297
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,839
the three point

1298
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,760
disadvantage first

1299
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,680
the third time waste bandwidth cells

1300
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,040
for example the that time is a

1301
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,640
great square is the sum sum of link

1302
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,440
delay

1303
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,760
output delay for empty delay

1304
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,720
and the processing delay this buffer

1305
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,440
cannot be used to send pancakes

1306
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,280
with the deterministic services

1307
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,440
so this magnesium prohibits

1308
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,440
the deployment with landing

1309
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,119
because the link propagation delay must

1310
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,440
be smaller than tc

1311
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,559
so if the tc

1312
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,680
if that is a if the link pro

1313
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,119
pro with the link is longer the tc

1314
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,400
is bigger the bounded legacy is bigger

1315
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,680
under the data

1316
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,359
is also higher the last

1317
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,720
advantage is that

1318
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,760
the node b will receive

1319
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,440
the the last pancake

1320
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,359
a circle in cycle x from node a

1321
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,520
and also receive the first package from

1322
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,640
cycle x x plus 1 from

1323
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,319
node a so the cycle

1324
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,079
and the guilty easily occur because of

1325
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,520
the variation in link delay and output

1326
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,839
delay

1327
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:26,559
next please

1328
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,000
a keying magnesium with multiple cyclic

1329
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,880
buffer

1330
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,440
is proposed the detonated foundation

1331
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,440
describes the requirement

1332
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,799
for cqf with more buffer

1333
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,520
the multi cyclic queue and the

1334
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,119
forwarding paper

1335
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,559
also recommended to support learning

1336
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,400
and good literacy and wise utilization

1337
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,960
so this way they couple the link

1338
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,480
propagation delay

1339
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,640
at the tc for example without centrify

1340
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,240
the bandwidth utilization tc can be used

1341
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,720
with arbitrary linked lists and the

1342
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,000
number of buffalo can be

1343
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,200
flexible site

1344
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,200
to solve the problem of cycle

1345
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,799
and the guilty a cycle label can be put

1346
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,400
in pancake

1347
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,000
this label identifies which

1348
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,119
cycle the pancake belong with the

1349
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,359
pancakes in different cycle

1350
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:36,319
can carry different cycle labels

1351
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:39,440
there can be multiple ways to map cycle

1352
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,240
label

1353
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,119
in the pancake to local cycle buffer for

1354
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:44,319
example

1355
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:47,040
the node b may receive the pancreas from

1356
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,599
different

1357
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,720
up upstream nodes then carry different

1358
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,559
cycle label

1359
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,839
and put the pancake into the the local

1360
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:56,799
label

1361
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,480
so it swamps to the

1362
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,319
upstream label to the local label

1363
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,599
maybe there are different

1364
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,200
magazines to achieve them

1365
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,919
next please

1366
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,000
welcome to reveal and contribute content

1367
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,480
and

1368
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,559
also are also welcome

1369
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:33,839
thank you

1370
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:40,000
hello cheer uh yes

1371
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,920
hello hello

1372
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,920
uh do you have a question or okay

1373
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,079
well uh uh thank you very much for the

1374
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,160
presentation um i'm not sure if we see

1375
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,400
any questions i actually see david is

1376
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,200
unmuted

1377
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,480
david do you want to make a comment yeah

1378
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,240
let me see if i can choose my words

1379
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,520
carefully here

1380
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,000
there's been some extensive uh behind

1381
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,040
the scenes

1382
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,799
discussion uh between myself

1383
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:12,000
uh the chairs and uh with the ads

1384
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,559
watching about this draft

1385
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,440
the advice i would give to the authors

1386
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,079
is to

1387
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:21,359
split the mechanism away from the

1388
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:24,480
location of the bits

1389
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,640
and then i think the crucial question of

1390
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,240
the debt net working group

1391
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,000
is whether the problem

1392
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,240
that the authors propose to solve is

1393
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,000
something that the debt network group

1394
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,200
wants to take on

1395
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,319
in which case a plausible path forward

1396
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,599
would be to work on the mechanism

1397
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,160
here and then go look for the bits

1398
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,680
elsewhere and i can think of at least

1399
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,720
four places

1400
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,959
where one might be able to find bits

1401
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,200
uh thank you how is this

1402
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,440
uh so so david how is this different

1403
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,400
from yakov's draft with respect to

1404
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:11,599
cueing mechanism versus encapsulation

1405
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,359
i'm not sure i want to split that hair

1406
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,720
or just observe

1407
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,280
that both those drafts came to detonate

1408
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,040
for dettnet to figure out

1409
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,520
whether the scope of what the group

1410
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,640
wants to work on

1411
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:25,520
includes the problems that yakov and uh

1412
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,240
this draft proposed to solve

1413
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,480
right so from my perspective certainly

1414
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,400
the normative thing that

1415
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,160
that that we require would be an

1416
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,640
encapsulation for the interoperability

1417
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,960
right and i think that applies both to

1418
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,040
yakov and our draft and

1419
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,000
um you know i i can just observe that

1420
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
would be the similar type of you know

1421
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,359
encapsulation

1422
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,400
that was done in support of prior in

1423
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,720
that matter allow me to suggest you get

1424
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,400
the cart and the horse in the right

1425
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,559
order if you have a defined mechanism

1426
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,640
it then becomes possible to go define

1427
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,559
being caps and this is a synthetic case

1428
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,000
i can think of multiple caps that will

1429
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,200
work

1430
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,599
right and and the the mechanisms are

1431
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,559
defined

1432
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,880
um like tsn they may not have been

1433
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,839
defined in

1434
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,000
the that networking group but the

1435
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,440
encapsulations you know

1436
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,960
in the same way as pre-op right where

1437
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,640
was pre-op defined

1438
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:19,280
um and why did that net take on the

1439
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,000
encapsulation

1440
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,160
mpls for it all right we have uh

1441
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,880
uh yaakov and q stur and q and i'll

1442
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,799
point out where over time

1443
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:31,200
um they usually let us run a few minutes

1444
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,000
over

1445
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,160
but we will have a hard stop when meat

1446
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,520
echo says

1447
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,359
we're done so we'll keep going as long

1448
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,760
as we can but just be aware we are over

1449
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,520
uh yakov i'll be really really quick

1450
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,039
um just as a response to uh

1451
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,160
what uh therapist said um i

1452
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,880
am not at this point recommending any

1453
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,760
particular

1454
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,640
uh encapsulation i'm bringing up a an

1455
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,359
issue

1456
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:00,559
i think this issue uh is a valid one uh

1457
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,760
it's one of the problems that i

1458
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,480
mentioned also that uh all kinds of

1459
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,520
gating have this

1460
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,599
problem but they have to absorb the

1461
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,599
amount of time between the switches

1462
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,160
um and i think that the right thing to

1463
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,440
do is if the mechanism

1464
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,960
actually can be proven to be efficient

1465
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,839
is you'll have to define either a

1466
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,440
universal encapsulation which is in

1467
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,640
addition to everything

1468
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,640
or find a way to stick the bits in and

1469
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,240
as uh

1470
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,520
was mentioned before there are several

1471
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,839
different places you can put it

1472
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,038
stuart

1473
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,960
well it seems to me that yeah yeah sorry

1474
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,039
is it seems to me that this is

1475
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,240
definitely a problem

1476
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,440
that net has the largest interest in it

1477
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,240
being the

1478
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,839
the working group that's working on the

1479
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:53,599
most critical form of

1480
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,280
um of uh time-related communications

1481
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,160
and so i think it this is really the

1482
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,280
place to at least

1483
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,039
start this piece of work if we decide

1484
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,280
that we need to export it to a

1485
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,119
specialist encapsulation group

1486
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,119
then that's fine but i think this

1487
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,559
working group is the working group that

1488
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,280
needs to ha

1489
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,359
to own this set of problems associated

1490
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,839
with

1491
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:17,920
getting packets to the right place in

1492
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,640
the right time

1493
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,480
okay thank you i'll point out uh

1494
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,760
i'll point out that to date we as

1495
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,760
a working group have only taken on

1496
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,599
informational documents related to

1497
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:32,400
queuing

1498
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,720
not standards track because we're that's

1499
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,839
outside our current

1500
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,400
charter and more than that the transport

1501
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:38,880
area

1502
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,200
typically owns queuing mechanisms i

1503
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,799
don't know of any case where

1504
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,359
a queuing mechanism has been defined in

1505
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,680
the routing area

1506
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,359
the definition of that though is if

1507
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,440
is not outside the scope of the ietf and

1508
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,799
if the

1509
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,079
ads and the transport area agree

1510
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,520
that you know the right place for it to

1511
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,440
be done is that net um you know

1512
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,480
we'll follow but we are being very

1513
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,400
careful as chairs to stay within our

1514
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,200
charter

1515
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,359
and to coordinate with the transport

1516
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:11,280
area on the definition of new queuing

1517
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,319
mechanisms

1518
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:14,799
referencing existing queuing mechanisms

1519
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:15,760
and how they

1520
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,799
operate with debt net and whether they

1521
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:19,359
need

1522
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,880
special bits on the wire i believe that

1523
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,920
is in scope

1524
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,079
that is within the discussion it's the

1525
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,760
queuing part that's not

1526
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,039
um i'm gonna go to

1527
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,839
uh david out of cue just because we

1528
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,520
might get cut off and if we're still

1529
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:37,359
going i'll we'll come back to toilets

1530
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:38,319
and stewart

1531
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,880
so david

1532
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,079
wearing my transfer working group hat as

1533
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:44,480
we're

1534
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,280
likely to be one of the places uh where

1535
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,799
the big hunting goes on

1536
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,839
the expertise on cyclic cueing is very

1537
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:52,319
clearly

1538
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,720
in debt net not in the transport area

1539
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,559
working with uncomfortable going looking

1540
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:56,960
for

1541
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,039
bits if the mechanism is defined here

1542
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,960
i'm not comfortable being the primary

1543
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,079
uh venue for defining

1544
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,000
okay thank you i mean and we can follow

1545
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,319
up with ads on that comment

1546
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,640
um so thank you uh tourists

1547
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,880
uh he dropped himself stuart uh so i am

1548
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,720
i'm pleased to hear that from david i

1549
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:20,000
would have been worried if it's gone to

1550
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,599
transport and then died

1551
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:22,960
but i because i think this is really

1552
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,559
important and because it's important to

1553
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:24,960
us

1554
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,200
we need to work on it uma

1555
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,520
uh hi uh so thanks uh thanks states i

1556
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,319
think my

1557
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,720
my opinion is basically uh the

1558
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,559
problems.net has been talking over a

1559
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,680
period of time

1560
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,720
uh with respect to bounded latency and

1561
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,880
also the jitter case this draft

1562
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,599
uh need to be solved in that net and

1563
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:46,720
also it's not

1564
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,119
this is uh like you know that net is

1565
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,280
more focused on p e to p e k s

1566
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,680
not to end to end so to speak from what

1567
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,640
psn uh

1568
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,520
tsv working group is doing so i think uh

1569
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,839
this has to be done in depthnet

1570
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,839
to the associated problems and use cases

1571
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,599
have been discussed for many years here

1572
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,760
okay uh stuart are you still in queue i

1573
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,640
assume you're out

1574
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,400
and all right um well uh thank you all

1575
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,440
for the discussion

1576
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,559
um as i mentioned before uh a big issue

1577
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:21,520
with queuing

1578
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,160
is uh our charter and that queuing isn't

1579
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,680
done in the routing area traditionally

1580
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,799
in the ietf

1581
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:29,119
uh but we'll we'll work to find a home

1582
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,240
and

1583
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,680
so we'll work with the transport area

1584
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,319
chairs which includes david and also

1585
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,359
with the

1586
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:41,599
um with the area directors

1587
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,880
who um you know the isg says where work

1588
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:45,599
goes so

1589
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:49,440
we'll work with them on that and um

1590
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,200
can i just jump in with a question there

1591
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,799
not about the queuing but

1592
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,799
you know if i observe yarkov's draft

1593
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:56,559
which i find very interesting from the

1594
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:57,839
perspective of

1595
01:07:57,839 --> 01:07:59,680
actually you know in contradiction what

1596
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:01,119
some people in spring thought

1597
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,240
i think is an ideal case of exploiting

1598
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,960
segment routing whether it's mpls or v6

1599
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,480
um we we haven't you know done

1600
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:13,839
sr as a forwarding plane in that net

1601
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,839
am i the only one that sees that as a

1602
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:17,198
gap

1603
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,000
uh that's a question we've um so sr has

1604
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,679
been raised a few times in the working

1605
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:22,640
group

1606
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,399
we've said we're gonna coordinate with

1607
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,839
the sr chairs and

1608
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,520
we've been talking with them over the

1609
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,439
last two or three ietfs

1610
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,279
uh privately we've said to them it's

1611
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,880
time we have to make a call as to which

1612
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,399
working group owns this

1613
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,719
um so uh we've said to them that we're

1614
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,080
happy to do it in debt net

1615
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,439
um but it's also um you know that's

1616
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:41,839
their

1617
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:43,359
forwarding technology so we want to

1618
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,960
coordinate with them and we'll let you

1619
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,080
know which working group

1620
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,238
that work should go to yeah from my

1621
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:49,198
experience with

1622
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:51,839
multicast and mpls or so i think that's

1623
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,439
an interesting discussion what to do

1624
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:54,080
best

1625
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,479
to get the best results so um yeah thank

1626
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,560
you

1627
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,399
all right uh appreciate everyone staying

1628
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,600
over we're gonna

1629
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,839
uh end the meeting now and really

1630
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,439
appreciate the contribution and look

1631
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:06,719
forward to further discussion on the

1632
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:07,439
list

1633
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:17,120
thank you all so much for participating
