um if this is your first time attending

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
an ietf working group meeting i suggest

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
you find a copy of the note well and

55
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,360
read it carefully

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
um those of you who are old-timers are

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,200
probably familiar with this this is the

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,599
standard note well

59
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,680
79 is the document which describes in

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,640
great detail

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
what this actually means but the

62
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,760
executive summary is that line in bold

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,200
which is

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
you are contributing to the ietf by

65
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,319
speaking

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,840
that's the short answer so um

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,920
and here is the various other policy

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,280
documents you need to know about

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
anti-harassment code of conduct if you

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,720
have any concerns about any of these

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,400
things we the chairs are your first port

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,959
of call

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,159
and we can escalate this to the various

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,280
working groups

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
set aside specifically to cover these

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
sort of things

77
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,519
so administrative um i'm assuming you're

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,280
all on me techo some of you might be on

79
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,920
jabba

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,519
some of you might be dialed in through

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920
some audio stream and just listening

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,799
but the details are on the screen now

83
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,760
key points

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,280
are um eve is currently tracking the

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,959
jabber which is integrated into meat

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,319
echo so

87
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,319
if you are if you have comment

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,720
please a quick chat message is great or

89
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
you can use the meet echo facility to

90
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,599
join the queue

91
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,720
equivalent of raising your hand and

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,799
we the chairs will uh start pushing

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,920
people through the queue so they can

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
make comments

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,519
at the microphone so to speak the other

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,000
key point is we are using kodi md

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,599
for our live minutes uh i'm not sure if

98
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
we've got a volunteer for a minute taker

99
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,080
yet

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,799
i can only see my screen and not meet

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,439
echo

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,640
um but

103
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
we need to collaboratively produce some

104
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
minutes for this meeting for posterity

105
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
so please join in uh the integrated cody

106
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
md it's marked down

107
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
it will handle multiple people typing

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,079
simultaneously

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,639
please don't massively overwrite other

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,840
sections that other people are typing

111
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,520
in uh there will be an opportunity

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
before uh miteka closes down at the end

113
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,280
of the session just to

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,040
quietly take out your typos and things

115
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,320
like that but i know at the last session

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,160
uh no sorry at the virtual 107

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
which we held we had a bit of a up

118
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720
with the blue sheets and we lost half

119
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
the attendees list because somebody was

120
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,080
very excitably editing or there was a

121
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,520
glitch or something so

122
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,360
um although it works pretty reliably

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,040
please be a little bit careful about

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
simultaneously typing exactly the same

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
characters as somebody else

126
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
um otherwise the normal things are we

127
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
have a mailing list i'm sure you're all

128
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
subscribed to it

129
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,440
the mailing list is the official place

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,479
where

131
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,479
consensus is achieved and decisions are

132
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
made so

133
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
if you have um a long and detailed

134
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,880
discussion the mailing list is the place

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,520
to have it

136
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
and even i may at certain points as time

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,560
presses on during this meeting say

138
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
let's take that to the list which means

139
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
it's a valuable discussion but it's

140
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,720
consuming all of our agenda and we want

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,000
to get on some other points

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
and the mailing list is the right place

143
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,080
for that and a link to the meeting

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,840
materials is at the bottom so this

145
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,880
should be uh well it isn't it isn't

146
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
should be it definitely is where you can

147
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,479
get a copy of all the presentations that

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,440
are being presented

149
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,240
plus um the chair slides and the agenda

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,960
and

151
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
the minutes should be there as well when

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,880
we have got around to uploading them

153
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
after this session it normally takes us

154
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,320
a little bit of time thanks to time

155
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
zones to get that sorted

156
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,280
but the minutes will go up there for all

157
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
posterity so

158
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,199
agenda um i've sort of done the intro

159
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,039
i'm doing the intro

160
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,800
we're going to kick off with ldax

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,479
because nielsen the team

162
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,360
have uh done lots of extra work and we'd

163
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,120
really like them to present what they

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
have done so we can see where we are in

165
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,400
terms

166
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,520
of progressing that document

167
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,160
as far as i'm aware it is getting pretty

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,120
mature

169
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,240
uh but i will leave niels to um let us

170
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
know what he thinks the next steps are

171
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
as far as the working group is concerned

172
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
this is a working group document so it's

173
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
ours the group

174
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,360
to have consensus on whether we think

175
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,919
it's

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
finished not finished ready for working

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,639
group last call etc etc

178
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,479
but uh niels and the author team

179
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,120
obviously are the ones holding the pen

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,160
after that uh pascal's gonna

181
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
go over the changes that have happened

182
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
in the

183
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,560
raw technologies draft so

184
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
that's um for those of you unfamiliar

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,000
it's a

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
great lengthy document which covers a

187
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
lot of the link there technologies that

188
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,759
are out there

189
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,720
um a lot of the things we're copying

190
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
across from

191
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,319
det net and sort of state of the art in

192
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,960
terms of

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
what we could use to build raw systems

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,639
and

195
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,880
tacked on to the end of that i i asked

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,000
pascal if he could go over some of his

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,919
uh what's currently a personal draft

198
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,680
into uh proposed architecture for raw

199
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
so this introduces some of the concepts

200
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,840
that

201
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,919
um have been discussed on the list

202
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
in person at meetings before uh

203
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
introducing the concept of path

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
selection element uh

205
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,120
how that integrates with om

206
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,360
and upstream uh traditional teas style

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,479
pce

208
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,319
and how that integrates downstream with

209
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,479
tsn and various wireless technologies

210
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,160
etc etc

211
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,919
and i thought it was useful to go over

212
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
that one more time because

213
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
following from that uh i'm doing a short

214
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,520
presentation on the d-let protocol and

215
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,840
how that might apply to raw how it might

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,440
bring us some interesting things that we

217
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,680
could reuse or build upon

218
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
um carlos bernandes has some interesting

219
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,760
uh use case analysis for um

220
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,440
[Music]

221
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,039
mech and i have to remember what this is

222
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
it's basically edge compute

223
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
use cases and how

224
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
those edge compute use cases really need

225
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,680
some

226
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,479
understanding of if they're running

227
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,199
within a raw

228
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,840
environment what can raw tell the edge

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,599
compute management system

230
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
and an orchestrator so that it

231
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,880
understands

232
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,039
the capabilities of the network as it

233
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,880
starts to push functionality out to the

234
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,399
edge but obviously i'll let carlos

235
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,279
clarify that

236
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
because i'm approximating my

237
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,640
understanding

238
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,399
and uh we have a presentation from

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,560
uh ruta sophia i hope i pronounce your

240
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
name correctly um

241
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,000
talking about some of the industrial

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,839
requirements so there's a really nice

243
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
personal draft has gone in

244
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
with lots of detail about industrial

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,839
wireless

246
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,880
and the sort of things that

247
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
that use case would like to see coming

248
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,160
from

249
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,080
uh determinism and reliable uh

250
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,200
layer wireless layer and and how sort of

251
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,720
what they'd like to see raw

252
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,800
tackle as part of their use cases and we

253
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
can have a discussion about that on

254
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,880
whether

255
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,560
that gets integrated into some of the

256
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,959
use cases documents or the technologies

257
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,640
or whether it lives on as its own

258
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
document and

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
hopefully that will promote some good

260
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,279
discussion as well and for the last 10

261
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,959
minutes we've set aside

262
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
some time for discussion we have a hard

263
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,480
stop because

264
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,320
this is the ietf working group meeting

265
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
so we have we are bounded by time

266
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
obviously uh as i said before

267
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
conversations can continue to the list

268
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
um add infinitum

269
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,399
so eve do you want to step in and go

270
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,519
through some of the milestones because i

271
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,480
feel like i'm just talking

272
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,440
sure i with the caveat that it's very

273
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
early here in the united states

274
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
and i don't know okay tap

275
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,120
tap out at any time okay okay um

276
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,279
um for those of you who've been tracking

277
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,839
our milestones uh they

278
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,440
these are the milestones we set when we

279
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,920
set our charter

280
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,600
and at that point in time we

281
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,519
identified four documents that we

282
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,200
had ambition to deliver both as working

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,839
group

284
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,480
items for adoption as well as you know

285
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,760
eventually to submit

286
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
to to graduate through the process and

287
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
those are the items that you see

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
here in bold face a use case documents

289
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,120
uh

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
originally what was a requirements

291
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
document but which has evolved into

292
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,640
somewhat of a technologies document uh

293
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,680
not somewhat but

294
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
it is evolved into alternatively a

295
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,200
technologies document

296
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
um the architecture framework document

297
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,560
and

298
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,200
ultimately get to a point where we have

299
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,839
um

300
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,839
a document that is evaluating the

301
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,399
existence of ietf technologies and a gap

302
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,760
analysis

303
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
and um so some of these items have

304
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,560
um already been created

305
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,640
um and are wending their way through the

306
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,839
system we

307
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,560
have a use cases document many of these

308
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,200
have been

309
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
um well i'll say that the use cases

310
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,560
document seems to be tracking

311
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,320
uh it's been um adopted by the working

312
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,880
group

313
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
as has the technologies draft

314
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,760
um the we have not submitted anything to

315
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
the iasg

316
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,399
as yet um but uh

317
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,920
you know and we'll have some discussion

318
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
today about the architectural framework

319
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,880
document

320
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,959
um and so you can see we're a little bit

321
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,279
uh behind in where we meant to be

322
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,120
but uh nonetheless there's a healthy

323
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
collection of internet drafts that will

324
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
we believe uh with some uh maturation

325
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,519
will get us to where we want to be so i

326
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,560
would say that

327
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,880
and we discussed this last time as well

328
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,680
that although

329
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,320
we are somewhat behind we are we seem to

330
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,519
be making steady progress

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,279
and we will focus a little bit

332
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,079
on although there's no evaluation of an

333
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,920
existing itf technologies and gap

334
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,279
analysis document we feel that that

335
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,560
the other documents are steadily

336
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,040
marching us towards that you can

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,880
advance forward please

338
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
so this is just a preview slide of what

339
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,000
we're hoping will happen

340
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,360
after the um presentations but while you

341
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,440
you are listening to the presentations

342
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
and hopefully participating in some of

343
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
the discussion afterwards

344
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,160
keep in mind that some of the things

345
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,480
some of the issues that are top of mind

346
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,440
is uh whether the architecture document

347
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:57,839
is

348
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,320
um ready for working group adoption uh

349
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,959
there have

350
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,279
been some just early morning back and

351
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,639
forth on the mailing list

352
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,360
which has been quite interesting um

353
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,000
which uh

354
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,040
we will return to a discussion today uh

355
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
the oam draft

356
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,399
uh is it also ready for working group

357
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,200
adoption and the technologies draft

358
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
should we be submitting it to the iesg

359
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
and then as was stated earlier we have

360
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
this wonderful new

361
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,279
detailed industrial requirements draft

362
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,320
whether to keep it

363
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
separate or combine it that seems top of

364
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,519
mind

365
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
and then um these other topics for which

366
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
we have presentations

367
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,680
um the the mech drafts the d left draft

368
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,560
for raw

369
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,639
and uh just to bring to your attention

370
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,680
um a draft that although we

371
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,399
decided uh not to schedule for this

372
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,120
session

373
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,040
we anticipate including it in the next

374
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,560
ietf

375
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,199
and part of why it's not here being

376
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,320
discussed is just

377
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
scheduling issues and also that it will

378
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,000
be

379
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,040
presented during the second session for

380
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,000
debt net which is

381
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,279
tomorrow and we would encourage

382
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,480
those of you participating here today

383
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
uh to attend there to to catch that

384
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,440
i think that's it without further ado we

385
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,839
should

386
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,279
head into our presentations and i

387
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,880
believe our

388
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,079
first presentation is the

389
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,079
uh i'll sell that so i believe give me

390
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,839
30 seconds to find it

391
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,920
um unless um i i think it's

392
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
oh yeah yeah i mean um niels if you want

393
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
to present that's fine because then you

394
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,560
can control

395
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
the slides by all means uh if you don't

396
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
have if you can't present i can

397
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,880
stand in if you need i know it'd be

398
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,199
great if you could present them

399
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,880
i will share them you you present them

400
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,439
i'll share them

401
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,800
perfect let me if for

402
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,279
some reason chrome puts these entirely

403
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,320
in a random order i think does that look

404
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,760
like the right slides and can you see

405
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,079
i think it does yeah good okay

406
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,720
okay yeah it's it's great to be here and

407
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
um today i'm going to give an update

408
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,279
about the

409
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,600
work that we've been doing for the last

410
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
three months

411
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,199
so next uh today i'm going to present

412
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,120
the ldx um

413
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560
the lbn digital air multiple

414
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,480
communication system turned ldax and the

415
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,160
draft version is o7

416
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,000
next slide please yeah here we find

417
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,120
the uh load well again i think we saw

418
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,959
that already next one please

419
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,240
yeah that's uh the current version um

420
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,800
so if you have not had the chance to

421
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,199
read it yet uh it's a great read i can

422
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
assure you so please go ahead

423
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,759
uh we also received a lot of feedback so

424
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,360
thank you everyone uh for

425
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,519
providing us with a valuable input so

426
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
far

427
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,600
and um as you can see this this version

428
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,320
is now from

429
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,600
17th of february 2021 so rather

430
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,920
recent next slide please

431
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,680
yeah here we can see some changes that

432
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,480
happened

433
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,680
since the last itf

434
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,440
line so last time was all about

435
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
bringing in the reliability part uh into

436
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
the draft so

437
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,320
why um ldx really fits the description

438
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,720
of the

439
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,000
the group theme here and now this um

440
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,279
time we were asked about the security

441
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,480
of ldax and so mainly we focused on

442
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,880
chapter 10 here so um the security

443
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,240
aspects of ldax

444
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,120
what kind of security do we need here in

445
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,639
this technology

446
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
also uh on a broader scale we had some

447
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
discussions uh with iko so with the

448
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,880
international aviation organization

449
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,720
and radio manufacturers about the

450
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
general architecture and ecosystem in

451
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,560
which aldex would live because aldex

452
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
will probably be deployed starting

453
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,839
around 2024

454
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,519
so a lot of things are currently

455
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,120
shifting and moving and it's quite the

456
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,240
exciting time to

457
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,880
to be honest and so also another

458
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
important update was just that um

459
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,319
basically in this draft what we're doing

460
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,720
is

461
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,119
describing the data link between a

462
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
ground station and an aircraft

463
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,919
so um in previous drafts we described

464
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,599
the data link architecture between a

465
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,119
ground station controller

466
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,039
controlling multiple ground stations and

467
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,000
then controlling multiple aircraft and

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,119
now

469
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
we're only focusing on the ground

470
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,359
station to aircraft station part

471
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,960
yeah so let's dig in next slide please

472
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,160
um let's start off with the

473
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,440
basic question so uh why does

474
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
aeronautical communications in

475
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,640
particular need security

476
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,799
and what did happen over the last 30

477
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,320
years i'm saying 30 years because

478
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,400
um aviation thinks in very long terms so

479
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
if you think the last digital data link

480
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,080
for terrestrial communication that was

481
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,640
actually

482
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
adopted and specified and so on there

483
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,679
was video number two

484
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,559
and the first specification that defined

485
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,480
that was in 1990

486
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
so though it's roughly 30 years ago

487
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,600
actually

488
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,799
and since then a lot has changed so um

489
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,039
the problem that we're facing now is the

490
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,200
the the changing threat landscape

491
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,960
because historically the communication

492
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,799
navigation surveillance and short cns

493
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
wireless technology

494
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,799
they emerged from the military and the

495
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,039
military has a lot more bandwidth they

496
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,799
have a lot more spectrum they have a lot

497
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,559
more resources

498
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,280
to for instance use physical layer

499
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,640
robustness measures such

500
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,200
as frequency hopping or pilot symbol

501
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
scrambling and stuff like that

502
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,919
so to make it robust and secure already

503
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,679
on the physical level and

504
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,400
for aldex this is not possible because

505
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,919
we're talking about the civil technology

506
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,799
here so we have less spectrum available

507
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,360
and then the question is um also with

508
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,600
software defined radio so i have

509
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
some laying around here actually and

510
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,880
then there's a lot of

511
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,640
open source software making them uh

512
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,840
able to to capture traffic or possibly

513
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,480
even to

514
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,360
inject data into the aeronautical data

515
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,400
stream and

516
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
as all of this is wireless obviously

517
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,600
this is um

518
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,679
quite the threat obviously civil

519
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,200
aviation is currently facing so the

520
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,559
consequences are

521
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
that future technologies and i'm talking

522
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,360
about eldags as one of them obviously

523
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,160
but also

524
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
one that was already published aeromags

525
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,320
or then satcom

526
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,880
iridium said certains or inverses with

527
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,559
broadband and and all the stuff coming

528
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,000
up for the future communication

529
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
infrastructure for aeronautical comms

530
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,720
um all of these need to have strong

531
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,919
security features

532
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,400
already implemented on on the link layer

533
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,080
basically because that's the first point

534
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,600
of contact obviously when you make

535
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,120
a contact with an aircraft and start

536
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,440
communications and so strong cyber

537
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,200
security measures are almost for aldex

538
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
and that's the consequence out of it

539
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,520
next slide please

540
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,240
uh here we have um the shells and

541
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,640
shoulds so what should ldex have which

542
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
shall alex have

543
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,160
obviously um the very first uh

544
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
requirement that's not listed here

545
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,120
specifically is if we

546
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,760
um use security measures here so if you

547
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,320
put security in the system obviously the

548
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
regular working should not be hindered

549
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,159
in any way so we have to make sure that

550
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,600
whatever security measures

551
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,559
are put in that safety is is in no way

552
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,360
endangered

553
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
obviously so that's um the availability

554
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
and continuity as we know it so

555
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
for instance um packet rate limiting and

556
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,039
stuff like that so

557
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,960
make sure that uh technology is

558
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
available but it's also make sure that

559
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,480
whatever security you put in

560
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
that the technology itself remains

561
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
available

562
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,240
then um one big important point is the

563
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,000
integrity of messages in transit

564
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,880
so whatever is being sent on the data

565
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,919
link needs to

566
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,120
to remain authentic and integra so

567
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,600
no other for instance no adversary

568
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,640
should be able to put

569
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,360
in data link on data on the data link

570
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,480
obviously

571
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
also authenticity so that means we have

572
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
to have mutual authentication

573
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,039
uh in in the field then they should

574
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,039
provide confidentiality so that's

575
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
um uh a question of

576
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,320
uh key management basically because um

577
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,080
obviously aviation is handled around the

578
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
world so how do you

579
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,080
make sure that if a message is delivered

580
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,600
in a confidential manner

581
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,640
and some air traffic control service or

582
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,919
some other air traffic control from

583
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,880
another country

584
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
needs to have access to this kind of

585
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,200
information so um confidentiality

586
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
is a should requirement for other

587
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
sensitive for instance business data

588
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,600
stuff like that then the non-repudiation

589
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,360
this is important obviously for the

590
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
sensitive part of the mutual

591
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,360
authentication key exchange part

592
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,520
um and then there's the authorized

593
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
permitted actions of users and deny

594
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
actions else so we have to have some

595
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,120
kind of

596
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,559
identification authentication

597
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,400
authorization and so forth

598
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,799
and also um alex needs to have some kind

599
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,720
of capability to prevent uh if if

600
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,400
there's an intrusion and

601
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,640
we need to prevent it to spread from

602
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
there obviously

603
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,520
so next slide please

604
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
so uh this brings me now on how do we

605
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
incorporate now security into the

606
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
protocol stack of ldac so

607
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,720
um ldx security is located on the link i

608
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,760
could say so

609
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,720
because above ldax above the subnetwork

610
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,080
protocol the snp

611
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,200
um it is foreseen to use ibv6 or

612
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,280
um and then above udp so um ldx security

613
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,640
secures the connection between an

614
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
aircraft station in the ground station

615
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,760
as i said before so just uh the

616
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,240
very first time for instance um there

617
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
there's a plane flying around

618
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,679
flying around and then there's an

619
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,200
aircraft station broadcasting it's

620
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,000
beacon

621
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,600
and then the aircraft catches up beaten

622
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
and sees okay um for instance there's

623
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,799
some kind of a signature with a

624
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
timestamp in something so i know it's

625
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,679
about the ground station

626
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,320
uh then it starts um making basic

627
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,960
contact so just a cell entry uh process

628
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,559
where the aircraft

629
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,280
gets access to the lx resources so the

630
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,440
actual data link communication user data

631
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,400
communication

632
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,559
and then the entire authentication

633
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,440
procedure actually starts um

634
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,600
so this is why we say the security

635
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,120
really is between aircraft and ground

636
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,760
station

637
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,480
next slide please

638
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,760
so yeah how do we put in security and

639
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,039
what kind of security

640
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,520
do we actually put in so um here we have

641
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,360
the protocol stack again so

642
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
below we have the physical layer medium

643
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,039
access layer mac and then we

644
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,559
see here this dch and dcch and so forth

645
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,320
so dch is the data channel

646
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,039
used for user data communication then we

647
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,760
have the ccch dcch

648
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
the random access channel the rach and

649
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,480
the pcch so many

650
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,559
many channels here so the random access

651
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,760
channel is the one where an aircraft

652
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,520
comes into the cell and says hey i'm

653
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,279
here i want to get access to the cell

654
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,520
the bcch is basically the broadcast

655
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,960
whereas when the ground station

656
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,120
announces its existence to the world

657
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,200
and then the common control channel the

658
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,559
ccch is

659
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,279
for um that the ground station grants

660
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,200
resources to an aircraft so an aircraft

661
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,400
can actually transmit

662
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
in the data channel and the this is the

663
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,000
age finally is the

664
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,120
resource request channel so to speak and

665
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,840
and then

666
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,760
you can see that the dls so the data

667
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
link service um here

668
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
is is for the user data part and the lme

669
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,720
that's the ldx

670
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,679
management entity is basically for

671
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,520
maintaining the link

672
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,240
and and also as you can see here now

673
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
handling most of the security part

674
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,720
and then on the snp so the subnetwork

675
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,600
protocol

676
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,360
layer v4c user data um security

677
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,760
so as we see here user plane security um

678
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,360
will be handled in the s p

679
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,080
currently we're discussing um and also

680
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,039
iko has

681
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,720
some ideas on that that aes 256

682
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,159
galore counter mode would be a great

683
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,080
idea because it provides confidentiality

684
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
and integrity at the very same time

685
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,080
so that's a great thing um if that's not

686
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,600
possible then also we're considering

687
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,559
hmac

688
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,120
with hash functions from the shower 3

689
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
family or shake

690
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,279
and then more interestingly actually is

691
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:01,840
the

692
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,360
lme now so um there will be ldx specific

693
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,400
certificates um the same way as

694
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
aeromax has arrowmax specific uh

695
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
certificate so aeromax is an airport

696
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
communication data link

697
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,960
and this aldex is for terminal

698
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,159
maneuvering areas

699
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,679
and on route communication on on

700
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,840
continental

701
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,400
flights basically or when an aircraft

702
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
flies over continent

703
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,159
and and so yes aldex specific

704
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,840
certificates and handles the mutual

705
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,520
authentication so there will be some

706
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,240
kind of

707
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,960
um station to station or sql protocol

708
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,640
i'm going to come to that a bit later

709
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,120
so entity authentication key negotiation

710
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,240
key derivation

711
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
key management key handling basically is

712
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,960
the task of the lme or some some

713
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,760
part of the lne lme obviously security

714
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
logging is what we need and because

715
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,080
resources requests or sending beacons

716
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,440
and stuff is also

717
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
triggered by the lme then the control

718
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,799
channel protection

719
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,360
in some ways also part of the enemy next

720
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,918
slide please

721
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,360
yeah um trust is probably the most

722
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,240
important thing

723
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,520
in any system so as i said before ldx

724
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,279
will follow the aeromax lead and also

725
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:15,919
using

726
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,480
future communication infrastructure fci

727
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,679
specific

728
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,200
pki um also defined here in

729
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,960
this rfc and we'll use some x 509

730
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
certificates that are very specific so

731
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,760
um prior to

732
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,679
um the atm ips so the

733
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,600
aeronautical telecommunications network

734
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
over for instance ip

735
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
there was way back a cars and and acres

736
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,240
in 2007.

737
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,799
they had a great update in the arring

738
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,000
standard 823 with eric message security

739
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,960
and they basically uh pre-define what

740
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,840
kind of secure

741
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,000
for what kind of certificates you will

742
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,919
have in this in this

743
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,880
ecosystem and we will probably follow

744
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,360
their

745
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,440
lead and also and just incorporate the

746
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,279
updates that happen since then

747
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,880
the mutual authentication and key

748
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,640
agreement

749
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,600
we have unique identities for aircraft

750
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,240
and ground stations

751
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,360
and we're currently going for either an

752
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,799
identity based station to station

753
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,440
protocol or an identity based

754
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,480
sign in max so sigma protocol so sigma

755
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,799
is part of dls 1.3 now

756
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,039
so um i think it's a great way to go

757
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,480
forward next slide please

758
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,279
yeah um then the choice of the diffie

759
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,799
hellman and that's a good question so

760
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,520
what kind of

761
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
different do we need because um of the

762
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,559
life span

763
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,960
of aeronautical communications uh you

764
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,679
would think we

765
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,600
will definitely have to go for a

766
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,799
post-quantum security

767
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,480
problem with post quantum is so we

768
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,320
looked into super singular society

769
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,760
helming key exchanges

770
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,279
it requires a keys of currently 2 640

771
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,760
bits so uh if you compare that for

772
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,200
instance the elliptic curve so

773
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,679
you have a factor of 10 in between so

774
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,640
the current

775
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,039
way forward will be to use an elliptic

776
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,880
curve cryptography with two five six

777
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,520
keys

778
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
and then um with the possibility

779
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,120
obviously to upgrade cypher suites two

780
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,240
to incorporate then

781
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,360
post quantum robust ciphers later on

782
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
and for key derivation we're going for

783
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,640
the hash based message authentication

784
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
code kdfs with hkdf

785
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,279
next slide please

786
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,919
as i said before user data security

787
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,039
as128 gallery counter mode

788
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,720
256 color counter mode or the hmax

789
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,960
3 128 should be enough for user data um

790
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
integrity protection simply because um

791
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,039
data is very limited still in the

792
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,399
spectrum so if you apply

793
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,440
for instance a 256 mac here a bit mac

794
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,360
here that's that's simply too large

795
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,919
and and the key basically is is the

796
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,559
result

797
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,000
of this mutual authentication key

798
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,440
agreement procedure that we discussed

799
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,399
earlier on

800
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,559
um so the station to station sigma and

801
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,559
then derived by the hkdf and then we

802
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,919
have the session key

803
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,399
to use for instance user data security

804
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,000
and now for control channel

805
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,320
security this is way more complicated

806
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,919
because the challenge is here

807
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,080
they are small i'm talking small about

808
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
the random access has 56 bits

809
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,000
the dedicated common control channel is

810
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,600
83 bits so

811
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,880
yeah they're small and um the other

812
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
important thing is that everyone in a

813
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,080
cell so every aircraft in itself needs

814
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
to be able to see what other aircraft

815
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,880
around

816
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
him or her or it's i think it's a bit

817
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,080
um received so uh they have to be able

818
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,679
to read that so we're talking about

819
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,399
group keys

820
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,320
um so we're talking about we have an

821
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,440
elder excel

822
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
group keys why are they one way function

823
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,200
trees because they simply put the least

824
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,120
amount of load on the link

825
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,200
time-bound signatures in the broadcast

826
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,039
in the broadcast channel then the cse

827
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,720
plus mac approach in the common control

828
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,480
channel and encryption cc and mac in the

829
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,200
dedicated

830
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,720
control channel simply because we don't

831
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,799
have space next slide please

832
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,960
yeah and uh i think i'm just in time

833
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,200
i made it thanks uh for listening

834
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,000
everyone and welcome for questions now

835
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
you very much niels that was that was

836
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,320
fast sorry we started slightly late and

837
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,600
therefore compressed you

838
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,440
um let's hold

839
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,840
questions because i see no one in the oh

840
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,679
yes uh

841
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,399
i i can't pronounce your name i am

842
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,440
really sorry but

843
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,799
but go ahead uh yeah okay

844
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,679
that's right uh nils um maybe it has

845
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,200
been discussed before but

846
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,399
can you revise what is the nature of

847
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,440
coordination between

848
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,880
iko and this craft and so

849
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,559
yes yes so so ldx will be part of the

850
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,640
future communication infrastructure and

851
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,399
the data link technology that is

852
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,640
discussed for the future communication

853
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
infrastructure

854
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,480
is currently being standardized and one

855
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
parts in the iko

856
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,960
so ldax has an official specification

857
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,279
and

858
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,039
for instance these are so the standards

859
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,200
and recommended practices were already

860
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,559
defined for ldx

861
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,320
within the iko and ako basically just

862
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,559
covers the aeronautical part of that so

863
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,159
the reason why we're here is because we

864
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,679
also need to cover the

865
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,559
reliability part right and this is why

866
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,080
we also think it's a great

867
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,600
technology use here for uh

868
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,279
for the um for the iatf

869
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,600
does that answer the question yes thank

870
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,320
you

871
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,399
you're welcome okay uh

872
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,120
thank you niels uh i think we will move

873
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,679
on

874
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,880
to pascal uh thank you very much let me

875
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,279
stop

876
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,640
sharing that and

877
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,080
find pascal slides if you are

878
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,960
there pascal there you go if you hear me

879
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,480
or okay i can share

880
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,240
if you're not for yours i have granted

881
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,760
you permission

882
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,519
that's easier it means like i can watch

883
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,760
you present rather than watch the slides

884
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,240
that's kyle sorry to to interrupt here

885
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,279
um i

886
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,200
just wanted to finish my talk with one

887
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
thing so we haven't received any

888
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,000
feedback

889
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
during the last three weeks so we

890
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,279
encountered everything

891
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,440
incorporated everything and now we would

892
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,760
like to ask for last call actually so if

893
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,360
there's any feedback um

894
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,679
please give the feedback you want to

895
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:18,399
give

896
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,200
and we're asking for the last call okay

897
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,080
noted niels

898
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,080
uh what i will do is i will make a note

899
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,200
to uh

900
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
say that on the list because that's the

901
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,880
right place to do the last call

902
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,480
um calls uh i'll announce that

903
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,039
i think given the complexity of this

904
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,600
subject we will probably go for quite a

905
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,360
number of weeks for the last call

906
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,720
sometimes you say two weeks because

907
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,240
everyone knows the subject

908
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,640
but i think people need to have a chance

909
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,360
to read this

910
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,799
in depth um so

911
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,320
obviously even i will have a discussion

912
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,000
with you about what we think the

913
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,840
complexity is but i can imagine six

914
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,279
eight weeks something like that to let

915
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,679
people know that means

916
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,960
everyone else in the working group

917
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,279
please take a chance to read this um

918
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,480
it's a good work but b it's a working

919
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,279
group document

920
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,240
so we the group need to be sure that

921
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
we're happy with this and when we are we

922
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,279
can press the button

923
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,600
so yeah thank you for the reminder niels

924
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,279
good thank you very much and thanks

925
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,760
pascal

926
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,360
go on pascal all yours okay i was citing

927
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
whether to share screen on just the app

928
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,120
so i shared the app and thank you for

929
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,399
for giving me back the

930
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,240
authorization okay so um

931
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,960
i have actually two things to discuss

932
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,799
one is the raw technology for which we

933
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,360
publish

934
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,480
published a draft one

935
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,440
with some additions on the airbag side

936
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
and then we'll go

937
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,679
per your request right to uh discuss a

938
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,279
bit on the architecture document and

939
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,720
what just happened so there are some

940
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,279
news

941
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,039
so actually i will i will send you the

942
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,039
update of the slide for publication

943
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:53,919
because

944
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,679
because of the discussion we had today

945
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,279
on the mailing list i

946
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,720
changed them a little bit um so

947
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,760
this is the technology so why do we have

948
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,840
this draft we have this draft because

949
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,279
some of the technologies that are being

950
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:07,840
used by

951
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,879
row are actually not usual to the atf

952
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,839
so it's pretty cool for people coming to

953
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,000
the group to have a one-stop

954
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
shopping place where they can learn

955
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,040
about the various technologies and why

956
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,639
they they can be used for uh the raw use

957
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,679
cases

958
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,000
so we we cover four technologies wi-fi

959
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,199
six and beyond wi-fi

960
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,480
seven be uh we cover

961
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,520
1540 ach which is the radio link used by

962
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,480
six dash

963
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,399
we cover 5g 6g nldx that neil just

964
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,119
discussed and thanks nils and karina for

965
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,639
the updates on this

966
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,399
techno terminal technology document um

967
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,800
so so what happened recently last time i

968
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,719
told you that we had this this simple

969
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,760
structure with

970
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,760
for x for technology x we had x1 x2 x3

971
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,480
and actually uh janas when he published

972
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,680
the 5g

973
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,000
he added something about deployment and

974
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,040
spectrum which

975
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,240
was kind of nice kind of sleek so we we

976
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
discussed with with the group whether

977
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,000
the other technologies should align to

978
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,440
this and

979
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,079
for now uh o'neill dax is but i really

980
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,640
hope that tsch and wifi do

981
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,720
as well because that's a very very

982
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,800
interesting uh discussion

983
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,359
mostly because you know the spectrum

984
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,280
that's currently used by most wi-fi

985
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,599
applications is a very busy spectrum

986
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,280
but there are for instance for wi-fi

987
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,119
there are opportunities of using cbrs

988
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,400
3.5

989
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,960
or using 4.9 which is normally an

990
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,599
emergency

991
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,680
band used by police and and firemen etc

992
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,480
but could also be used for for instance

993
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
amusement game if they have delegation

994
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,760
for it and i know

995
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,079
some games like disney for instance uh

996
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,000
can use 4.9

997
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,400
so that's that's a a pretty interesting

998
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,760
discussion if you want to reach more

999
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,680
determinism more reliability

1000
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,000
then uh having some capabilities to play

1001
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,800
with spectrum

1002
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,119
is is important so we have this

1003
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,000
discussion

1004
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,160
in ldax we have this discussion in 5g i

1005
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,440
wish to have it

1006
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,000
in wi-fi and for tch there is not much

1007
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,640
to say

1008
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,680
because it's just the plain um sub gig

1009
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,480
and and 2.4 belts for now uh maybe in

1010
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,200
the future

1011
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,400
but um

1012
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,280
so what's new the dock was adopted we

1013
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,520
are now zero one

1014
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,000
um four i can say apart from this

1015
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,079
discussion on spectrum that that i just

1016
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,200
introduced we are

1017
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,640
pretty much there um so

1018
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
i would you know like to discuss with

1019
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,400
the chairs and how to move on with

1020
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
uh asking for publication um

1021
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,839
like i said this was already emulated by

1022
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,760
a dac so only really wi-fi

1023
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,760
uh needs to to to do some work on that

1024
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,800
maybe some things change on on the 11th

1025
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,200
side so maybe there could be some little

1026
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,160
uh update on on ts and over wi-fi

1027
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,640
so that's something i'd like to see um i

1028
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,200
was wondering if we wanted to

1029
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,560
uh to discuss a little bit

1030
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,839
about ip itself like for now this is

1031
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,440
just the

1032
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
lower layer technologies to want to

1033
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,560
stick at that

1034
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,119
or do we want to to have some notes

1035
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:19,680
about

1036
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,480
how we could signal stuff at the upper

1037
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,400
layer that we could fit into the lower

1038
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,119
layer

1039
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,680
maybe maybe not it's just something i

1040
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,119
was wondering

1041
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:30,720
so if you want to discuss that on the

1042
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,880
mailing list but

1043
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,720
my bottom line is i'm very happy with

1044
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,839
the content of this document

1045
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,680
i was wondering if

1046
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,280
we want some more on the prime statement

1047
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,640
i realized that there are documents like

1048
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
the one that root has just which we'll

1049
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,920
be discussing which will

1050
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,320
also contain some requirements and prime

1051
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,359
statement

1052
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,359
uh i'm not really clear about where that

1053
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,400
piece goes uh

1054
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,880
that's another discussion for the chairs

1055
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,800
because

1056
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,560
we see some of the prime statement in

1057
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
this document kenneth we see some of it

1058
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,680
in the architecture and we see some of

1059
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,160
it in the in the use cases so so

1060
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,960
do we think that uh it's something that

1061
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,240
you can intuit from these three

1062
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,920
documents or something that should be

1063
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,880
written

1064
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,240
somewhere like here so rick jumping in

1065
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,200
on that point

1066
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,040
um a question to the working group i

1067
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,680
would say

1068
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,480
is do we actually want to pull that text

1069
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,280
out of

1070
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
each of these three documents and make a

1071
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,720
short punchy

1072
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,119
problem statement draft or are we just

1073
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,200
making work for ourselves

1074
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,960
open question how do we know what prime

1075
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,200
we solve already it's so obvious

1076
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,760
it's it's not a yes but the counter

1077
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,960
argument to that would be

1078
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,880
we all understand because we are active

1079
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,640
participants in the working group

1080
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,200
but in five years time when someone

1081
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,280
comes to this topic because they've been

1082
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,400
told they must implement raw in some way

1083
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
there is no explicit reference material

1084
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,400
to say this is the problem raw

1085
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,480
is trying to solve i think we need to

1086
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,160
look at what debt net has done

1087
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,079
because debt net has done a really good

1088
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,000
job of this sort of thing

1089
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,960
and take some guidance from what they've

1090
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,760
they've done

1091
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,320
but perhaps a problem statement document

1092
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,599
if it doesn't

1093
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,520
waste our effort may have value but

1094
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,960
let's take that one to the list but i

1095
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,720
think that's a useful well if we've got

1096
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,320
time at the end of the session

1097
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,400
that's a useful discussion yes and when

1098
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,839
we are on the architecture side you will

1099
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:32,880
see as well

1100
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,640
what from the architecture document

1101
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,000
could actually move to a private

1102
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,720
statement

1103
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,400
on in this one it's really this piece

1104
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,800
right the piece on scheduling

1105
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,880
it could move either to the architecture

1106
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,359
uh or to the prime statement

1107
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,480
it really explains uh why what

1108
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,920
you know what scheduling can do for you

1109
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,599
and why it's needed

1110
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,320
but why this text is actually left in

1111
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,520
the

1112
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,920
in in the technology draft um it's just

1113
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
you know it could it's okay they are

1114
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,599
because of those technologies can be

1115
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,200
scheduled it's also okay to move it

1116
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,240
elsewhere

1117
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,079
for now it found it's home there it's

1118
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,079
just you we need to reconsider

1119
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,240
this from from and i like this question

1120
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,520
because i know that we in

1121
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,560
earlier uh iets we discussed this and

1122
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,960
we punted on the issue but you can see

1123
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,240
what's happened which is that it's

1124
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,359
scattered about

1125
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,520
in several documents and i like the

1126
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,599
crisp definition frankly

1127
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,000
of the problem statement in debt net and

1128
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,960
i i

1129
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,480
personally believe that it would be good

1130
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,480
to emulate it

1131
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,079
could be it could be that we move this

1132
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,680
text on scheduling to the architecture

1133
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,119
and we take the prime statement text

1134
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,400
from the architecture

1135
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,079
with some text from the use case and

1136
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,240
call that the prime minister

1137
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,440
let's let's see and there's someone in

1138
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,839
the queue

1139
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,760
yeah go ahead absolutely

1140
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,839
yes do you hear me yes we do

1141
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,440
okay uh regarding i i am very interested

1142
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
in this

1143
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,040
draft or document important and i agree

1144
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,200
with uh

1145
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,200
that we need to discuss the problem

1146
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,040
statement and uh

1147
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,920
the case uh the use case for this uh

1148
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,359
document so because

1149
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,560
it's related to the aw or the raw

1150
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,920
uh technologies uh regarding the 5g

1151
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,119
actually it includes technologies which

1152
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:27,839
are not

1153
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,200
uh are aw or raw technologies

1154
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,240
so it will be nice to understand

1155
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,560
the difference between both of these

1156
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,000
technologies or the

1157
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,280
how it includes in the 5g technologies

1158
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,640
uh i haven't read

1159
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,040
the document uh deeply but i'm

1160
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,240
interested to uh

1161
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,640
to get a feedback on this because

1162
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,760
usually when uh

1163
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,440
on the documents as for uh as a title

1164
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:55,839
saying

1165
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,960
uh raw technologies that means it's the

1166
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,520
use where we can say the background for

1167
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,079
us all

1168
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,520
this working group so it needs uh

1169
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,440
to be very very well read and very well

1170
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,640
commented on thank you thanks

1171
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,040
so i asked for sharing again because i

1172
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,319
need to share a separate document for

1173
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,520
the architecture please

1174
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,640
uh yes

1175
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,520
so there we go

1176
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,560
so like i said i already pushed two

1177
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,440
raka of the data tracker the new slides

1178
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,079
for the

1179
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,359
uh technologies now that this

1180
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,280
is a slider i need to push to you as

1181
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,599
well uh the first update

1182
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,760
one second we've got carlos in the queue

1183
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,280
sorry go ahead carlos

1184
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,880
hey can you hear me yeah yep sorry it

1185
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,319
was just one star comment on the

1186
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,079
previous one on the technologies one if

1187
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,760
i remember properly i volunteered

1188
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,079
in the past itf in the last ctf to

1189
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:00,800
review that

1190
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,920
and i've event my my apologies so i saw

1191
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,079
that you were requesting some

1192
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,680
pre-working group last call reviewers

1193
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,280
pascal so

1194
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,839
count on me i'm sorry

1195
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,800
so yeah so if if we could get

1196
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,640
a slight update from the wi-fi side

1197
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,960
that would be wonderful and then we

1198
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,040
would and if we have to eliminate this

1199
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,599
piece

1200
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,160
which is could be moved the one on

1201
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,799
scheduling

1202
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,599
then let's finalize the document and

1203
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,440
then you can do your review i mean let's

1204
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,160
agree and what

1205
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,480
exactly what move we do and once we've

1206
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:46,079
done those moves yes let's figure the

1207
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:47,280
review please and that will really

1208
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,119
appreciate your risk you call us

1209
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,880
okay so what that sounds like to me is

1210
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,040
at the last ietf we discussed was this

1211
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,640
ready for last call

1212
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,800
i think we still don't think it's ready

1213
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,560
because there's questions over the

1214
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,440
problem statement

1215
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,760
there's questions over the wi-fi and i'm

1216
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,280
going to raise a question in my

1217
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,560
um presentation as well so i think we're

1218
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,200
close

1219
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,280
but we're not there yet that's what i'm

1220
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,359
hearing but um yeah more comments to the

1221
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,319
list

1222
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,599
doesn't mean we have to wait for the

1223
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,520
next year

1224
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,680
we need to to to very to be specific and

1225
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,040
what we're going to achieve

1226
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,520
do it and then let's let's trigger okay

1227
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,240
so so and now that's for the

1228
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,359
architecture or the

1229
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,440
how much time oh i don't have much much

1230
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,720
time uh you can

1231
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,119
you can buy a little bit of time we we

1232
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,880
actually have more than 10 minutes spare

1233
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,760
at the end

1234
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,880
so uh you're okay okay so

1235
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,560
the first the first challenge is since

1236
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,640
today i just published ocx

1237
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,720
uh very little changes but what you can

1238
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,319
see on the remaining last

1239
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,319
the biggest change is i invited lou

1240
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:51,760
because he kind of

1241
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,599
indicated that he would be interested

1242
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,800
but it's not 100

1243
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,040
sure but since it's still this personal

1244
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
submission i i did that

1245
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,800
and i hope that lou effectively finds

1246
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,000
the time to contribute and help us here

1247
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,240
this is a slide that is pretty much the

1248
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,960
one i presented last time

1249
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,480
um the one thing i shared on this slide

1250
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,040
is how again because of a a requirement

1251
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,160
um from lu in his mail

1252
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,200
he said hey oh i read he said um you're

1253
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,160
describing

1254
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,920
a lot of the uh cross layer integration

1255
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
which we can do on tach

1256
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,880
very specifically and not much

1257
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,880
on what is pure ip layer

1258
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,640
and my intention was exactly the

1259
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,319
opposite i think we said when we

1260
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,839
chartered etc

1261
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,680
that we won't be focusing on one

1262
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,440
particular technology where we could do

1263
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,200
cross layer like thch

1264
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,880
otherwise we would have done that at six

1265
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,839
dash rather we want to to be over the

1266
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:52,240
top

1267
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,200
the top you know of layer two and

1268
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,640
provide ap layer

1269
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,160
generic layer to independent operations

1270
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,520
and what we want to do specifically is

1271
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,119
so this is really the sentence that i

1272
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,800
wrote here and uh put on

1273
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,040
the email as well we want to bring some

1274
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,560
more dynamics

1275
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,000
in how we do per packet control um

1276
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,079
to to trigger that net services

1277
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,760
for one packet but not necessarily the

1278
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,520
same for the next packet

1279
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,400
which is basically this psc uh engine

1280
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,920
that that we define

1281
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,599
and we also need to define the signaling

1282
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,200
that will enable the activity of this

1283
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,640
psc engine

1284
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,560
so so that's why i added this text

1285
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,800
really the intention and and now i'm

1286
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,720
checking with the group that will agree

1287
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,160
we are doing a an ip layer

1288
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,640
layer to independent technology over the

1289
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,599
top

1290
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,480
and what we are doing is is controlling

1291
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,680
how we

1292
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,720
we make the uh that net services layer

1293
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,560
that net service layer operation like

1294
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,800
replication elimination and we extend

1295
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,800
actually what that net has defined with

1296
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,560
barrio um overall radio networks but we

1297
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,520
could do the same

1298
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,319
same on non-radio networks with because

1299
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,920
we are layer twin dependent

1300
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,720
it's more like radio needs it radio

1301
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,640
brings us a lot of diversity that you

1302
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,119
know pure point-to-point wires won't

1303
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,040
let us use dynamically this diversity

1304
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,599
to defeat combat the the packet loss

1305
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,640
which is also specific to radio

1306
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,200
pascal can i can i add an extra point

1307
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,000
there which is

1308
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,200
i completely agree with you that it's

1309
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,680
about providing an ip layer across

1310
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,880
the possible layer two technologies uh

1311
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,640
and i think going back to abjassalam's

1312
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,040
point about the technologies draft

1313
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,800
i think the technologies draft should

1314
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,319
probably be called underlying

1315
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,480
technologies or supporting technologies

1316
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,480
because it discusses the

1317
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,040
the layer two out of which we can build

1318
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,680
the left

1319
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,200
or on top of which we can build the

1320
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,680
layer three my comment is i should

1321
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,200
probably take it to the list anyway but

1322
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,480
pareo

1323
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,240
um you know the opportunistic

1324
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,920
overhearing that may work

1325
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,960
really well for some

1326
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,680
link layers when you can get that cross

1327
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,240
layer communication but

1328
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,359
i can't see in things like 802.11 or in

1329
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:19,119
5g the the ip layer even getting

1330
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,599
access to do to start turning on radios

1331
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,760
into overhearing mode so

1332
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,559
we have to understand that that perio is

1333
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,720
is a great technology overhearing part

1334
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,960
of pario is a great technique when it is

1335
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,720
possible from the link layer

1336
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,480
but with some link layers it's just not

1337
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,640
possible but that doesn't prevent

1338
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,280
raw and perhaps it's just a matter of

1339
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,800
changing some of the wording slightly

1340
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,000
and i'm happy to suggest text which i

1341
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,839
have been before but have failed to

1342
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,079
actually do so i'm very sorry and i will

1343
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,319
and i will do better but i just

1344
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,920
otherwise i completely agree

1345
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,960
um because this is the ietf we have

1346
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,160
our our remit is link is ip

1347
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,680
not the link there yeah carry on

1348
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,880
i completely agree with you uh

1349
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,599
because it's the same concept of

1350
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,880
barriering

1351
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,359
can be used for instance just to give

1352
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,640
you an example

1353
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,000
uh in d11 ocb um where

1354
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,119
you don't have the context of a bss and

1355
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,119
so you are not constrained to an

1356
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,400
association

1357
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,280
of who sends and who receives so instead

1358
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,680
of being point to point

1359
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,440
because of the association which filters

1360
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,040
who can talk to whom

1361
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,280
uh 11p can be multiplied to multi-point

1362
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,319
and so you can effectively do

1363
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,240
exactly the exact same thing i i am sure

1364
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,480
there is link there technology solutions

1365
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,040
per

1366
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,800
technology um i'm just very wary about

1367
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,680
producing link layer specific solutions

1368
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,559
oh

1369
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,960
yeah exactly the intent is absolutely no

1370
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,240
link layer specific

1371
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,079
but overhearing doesn't have to be

1372
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,160
linked layers yeah yeah yeah i just

1373
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,559
not on a given technology but it's not

1374
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,800
something that's specific to tch no no

1375
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,720
no and i i could imagine doing something

1376
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,079
clever with any cast

1377
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,680
and um ip tunnels and effectively

1378
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,480
producing overhearing using any cast

1379
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,680
which would be surreal but conceivable

1380
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,760
or broadcast i mean if you yeah yeah

1381
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,880
yeah in 11p

1382
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,559
you could think of all your mac layer

1383
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,440
transmission being a broadcast mac

1384
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,040
and only ip will decide yeah

1385
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,040
anyway let's let's move on okay um

1386
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,079
but your point about renaming the draft

1387
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,800
technologies i love it let's rename it

1388
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,440
like an

1389
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,359
underlying technology or something and

1390
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,359
then please think twice about whether

1391
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,520
this discussion on scheduling

1392
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,280
uh which is really about those

1393
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,760
technologies should stay there or not

1394
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,200
it's okay that's definitely

1395
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,880
in the cube as well told us go ahead

1396
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,880
yeah um so i think this discussion was

1397
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,559
very interesting from the perspective i

1398
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,920
would agree that there shouldn't be

1399
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,880
something

1400
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,800
for existing link layer specific

1401
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,000
technologies on the other

1402
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,520
hand these layer 2 tool sets that can

1403
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:11,920
help

1404
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,160
build a better layer 3 on top of it

1405
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,319
might be a good thing to collect and

1406
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,880
you know promote to the layered

1407
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,359
technologies as they evolve

1408
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:23,040
absolutely and i see that as part of

1409
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,480
raw's remit so

1410
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,880
to be able to push back to the layer 2

1411
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,960
emerging layer 2 technologies to say

1412
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,119
hey we can do some really cool stuff at

1413
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,640
layer 3 using the

1414
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,040
raw framework and architecture please

1415
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,760
consider this as you start to uprev your

1416
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,520
your link layer to do more exciting

1417
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
wireless things well just make sure that

1418
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,119
it is packaged in a way that they don't

1419
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,880
have to wait through hundreds of pages

1420
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,920
they are not interested in

1421
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,960
noted go ahead lou

1422
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,400
sorry pascal you've kicked off a

1423
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,800
conversation but that's the point

1424
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,119
yeah yeah and i was getting at on the

1425
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,040
list uh i wrote this in jabber doesn't

1426
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,839
seem like anyone's

1427
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,400
channeling that i'm sorry i think i

1428
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,920
think there's a difference between the

1429
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:04,960
architecture

1430
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,119
and a particular like solution space

1431
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,160
framework

1432
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,040
and um you know what what pascal's

1433
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,720
talking about here i think is perfect

1434
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:13,280
for a

1435
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,240
particular solution space that as ricky

1436
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,800
just said

1437
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,599
is within scope of the working group now

1438
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,559
that said

1439
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,319
it's not the only solution so it doesn't

1440
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,240
belong in the architecture document

1441
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,119
so i i really think it's um you're

1442
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,559
making the case that we need to split

1443
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,240
these where the architecture should be

1444
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,000
allow for any particular solution

1445
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,839
whether it's this heavily integrated

1446
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,200
solution or or

1447
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,400
you know a more traditional layered

1448
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,920
solution we want to allow for both of

1449
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,400
those

1450
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,000
and then we can have frameworks that

1451
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,960
focuses on each of those

1452
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,040
i i'm in a sorry i'm jumping in i'm in

1453
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,880
total agreement lou because i think

1454
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,800
some of the architecture is great and

1455
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,720
really generic you know the pse

1456
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,760
concept uh all that discussion about

1457
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,800
uh fast turnaround decision making as

1458
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,400
compared to the much slower turnaround

1459
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,359
pce

1460
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,280
that highlights the need for that

1461
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,280
control plane protocol so that the

1462
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,920
pse can understand what it's doing all

1463
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,920
of that is great and very generic

1464
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,520
and then yes for some of the fine detail

1465
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,440
about overhearing and some of the

1466
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
uh some of the pareo techniques that may

1467
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,640
be applicable to some

1468
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,280
link layers if given the requirements of

1469
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:19,920
link layers

1470
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,040
to support it possibly brought out as

1471
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,960
we're creating more documents but i

1472
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,119
think we're not creating more content

1473
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,400
so i'm i'm in favor

1474
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,400
go ahead george you hear me hello

1475
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,520
yeah yeah i just wanted to ask whether

1476
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,440
this framework part where technology

1477
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,760
specific do you envision on a separate

1478
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,400
document

1479
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,520
or like subsection somewhere at the end

1480
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,559
of the architectural document

1481
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,400
like we have in the beginning of this

1482
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,680
architectural document

1483
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,440
the independent layer to independent and

1484
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,000
then

1485
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,720
at the end we have a layer dependent

1486
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,319
even though i'm not sure if overhearing

1487
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:00,880
it is

1488
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,480
like my personal opinion

1489
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,960
is because i'm lazy i would do it on

1490
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,680
demand

1491
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,200
so i would include it all in one

1492
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,440
document because it's easier to work on

1493
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,119
right up until the point where that

1494
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,359
section becomes 26 pages

1495
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:16,960
and then you say do you know what this

1496
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,800
is a different document and then you cut

1497
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,520
paste

1498
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,640
create a new document i think we could

1499
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,760
over plan this

1500
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,440
and find we don't have people who are

1501
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,520
interested in actually doing the work

1502
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,720
okay but yeah

1503
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,800
but the intention even for overhearing

1504
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,040
the intention was not to be specific or

1505
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,240
even integrated

1506
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,559
the intention was to be able to signal

1507
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:39,680
uh please

1508
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,839
pick these packets and and have enough

1509
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,359
abstraction that it can be

1510
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,599
uh they are too independent but if we

1511
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:46,559
can do it

1512
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,119
it's fine but the goal was to to make it

1513
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,799
viable because i know at least two of

1514
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,960
those radios which can do it

1515
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,799
oh and it's a very useful technique to

1516
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,520
have so it's got to be mentioned

1517
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,599
um but that's fine detail let's let's

1518
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,280
take that exact detail to the list

1519
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,720
because i think the intention was not to

1520
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,799
be specific to one technology certainly

1521
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:05,359
i mean

1522
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,599
since since i mean loose point at the

1523
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,720
first buff

1524
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,000
we kind of moved clearly towards

1525
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,799
the ipl iep layer operation layer to

1526
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,119
independent blah blah blah

1527
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,640
okay so um the architecture itself

1528
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,760
basically describes three steps we

1529
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,319
um we need to learn about and it's it's

1530
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:27,839
a loop right it's a per permanent

1531
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:30,319
feedback loop where we learn from oem

1532
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,280
um we we we make a forwarding decision

1533
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,200
for the packet

1534
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,400
which is done with this new psc entity

1535
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,240
that we have defined

1536
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,280
by selection engine and and then we take

1537
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,000
action

1538
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,240
and the action might be done on the same

1539
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,400
node where the psc has run or it can be

1540
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,480
done on a different node for instance

1541
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,960
uh the pse could just act as a thin

1542
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,680
grass

1543
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,160
like there is a full feedback loop from

1544
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,799
the path

1545
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,359
uh through the the egress back to the

1546
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,240
ingress

1547
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,160
so the ingress knows how the previous

1548
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,839
packets have failed

1549
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,000
and so it can make decision for the next

1550
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,960
pack yet

1551
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,280
in that model um it would basically

1552
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,720
signal something in the packet

1553
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,640
like segment routing or something which

1554
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,559
would affect the

1555
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,839
just control the the the that net

1556
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,119
service layer in for instance

1557
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:19,920
replication

1558
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,119
are not d in this picture um

1559
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,440
it could also be that um the uh the pses

1560
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,079
is distributed which means that every

1561
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:31,920
node would actually think about what to

1562
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,520
do with this bucket based on the rest of

1563
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,559
the way

1564
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,000
in which case the kind of signaling that

1565
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,440
you would find in the packet would be

1566
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:37,920
more

1567
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,880
of a hint the ingress hints like i want

1568
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,960
to get this level of quality

1569
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,000
and uh i'm distributing this this load

1570
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,839
or the statistics to get there

1571
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,760
to different nodes and and they have to

1572
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,920
act on it to reach kind of a goal that

1573
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,079
they are given something more abstract

1574
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,839
so that the psc which would be

1575
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:57,520
distributed would have to think about

1576
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,040
what to do to achieve what's

1577
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,160
being asked so that's what i mean by raw

1578
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,520
services to int or control the

1579
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,400
net service layer

1580
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,319
here so

1581
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:16,400
uh yes there's there's an extreme point

1582
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,359
where

1583
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:20,400
um the pse is fully distributed meaning

1584
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:20,799
that

1585
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:24,000
every node is aware of the oam

1586
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,480
and the packet just contains the

1587
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,880
information about the flow like pure.net

1588
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,000
information

1589
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,200
without any sr v6 type signaling which

1590
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,640
would indicate the decision

1591
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
done somewhere else or the hint from

1592
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,839
somewhere else

1593
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:42,319
and so each node a b c d on this path

1594
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,319
would have to make its own full decision

1595
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,839
based on the rest of the way

1596
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,880
so right now the architecture allows all

1597
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,480
those models

1598
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,040
um just like in the dead net

1599
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,760
architecture

1600
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,440
we allowed the number of models but then

1601
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,880
we said hey uh

1602
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,680
we're gonna go for this so here at some

1603
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,559
point

1604
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,119
uh even if we describe all those models

1605
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:03,920
uh

1606
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,440
if we decide to move on with doing

1607
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,319
something we'll have to to

1608
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,119
to discuss exactly how for instance do

1609
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,799
we really want to do this fully

1610
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,720
distributed thing

1611
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,520
which can be hard

1612
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,200
um and then so the the the that net

1613
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,319
service uh layer white direct plane here

1614
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,680
it's in

1615
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,680
network plane but it's called service

1616
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,319
layer sub-layer whatever

1617
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,280
um so in the data service layer we have

1618
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,839
actually enriched it

1619
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,440
um so part of that is two sparrow

1620
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,119
functions that we have discussed

1621
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,359
uh there is all the time discussion

1622
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,839
which is uh the presentation that jakov

1623
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,760
will be doing tomorrow

1624
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,520
uh at that net and

1625
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,680
there are all the kind of hints and

1626
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,799
control

1627
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,839
that we could uh tag it from the ingress

1628
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:56,960
in the packets

1629
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,160
so the rest of the way can can make uh

1630
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,400
just flowing in there following actions

1631
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,160
of also more uh

1632
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,720
psc level determination so whether it's

1633
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,160
a hint and then you have a distributed

1634
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,680
plc

1635
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,559
or of pure control and then in in the

1636
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:14,240
intermediate node all you need to have

1637
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,839
is a service layer which understands

1638
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,240
that control

1639
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,440
so that's pretty much what we want to

1640
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,599
describe

1641
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,599
very abstractly in the architecture

1642
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,079
as it goes we've done a lot more than

1643
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,280
that

1644
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,680
because we don't have framework

1645
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,960
documents and we don't have prime

1646
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,040
statement documents so we can have three

1647
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,079
parts

1648
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,400
uh one of them is is read the prime

1649
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,680
statement so

1650
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,760
uh it's it was much needed because we

1651
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,839
don't even have a terminology without it

1652
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,960
so so we we we define the terminology we

1653
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,640
define what we mean by reliable and

1654
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,599
available

1655
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,079
um that was a huge discussion at the

1656
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,280
buff

1657
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,799
um and we we actually decided to to

1658
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,160
base the those definitions on what nasa

1659
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,319
actually uses for the space shuttle

1660
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,079
so it's you know

1661
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,599
whatever happened to the space shuttle

1662
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,359
the definition look good

1663
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:14,480
um then

1664
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,520
yeah you know um and then uh use case

1665
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,880
and recommend served

1666
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,839
uh here we are not dealing with specific

1667
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,920
use cases like

1668
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,079
um amusement parks or industrial blah

1669
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:29,280
blah what we mean

1670
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,880
is really use case in terms of

1671
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,559
single hub multiple access or

1672
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,079
more like single technology multiple

1673
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:40,720
hubs

1674
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,520
basically so that's why we have this

1675
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,839
2.3.1

1676
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,319
radio access protection in which we

1677
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,400
discuss

1678
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,440
the first picture here so we discuss

1679
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,319
oops this model you could have for

1680
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,240
instance 5g and wi-fi

1681
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:59,440
and the psc will define decide whether

1682
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,280
to use 5g wi-fi or both

1683
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,599
it's just an example but it shows that

1684
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:04,400
if you if

1685
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,960
you can already do it within 5g you are

1686
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,480
going to be able to do it

1687
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,040
with wi-fi 7 as well inside the

1688
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,240
technology

1689
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,799
but it would probably provide even

1690
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:15,359
better

1691
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:18,559
diversity so better reliability if

1692
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,720
you can do it across technologies and

1693
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,599
that's why

1694
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,960
going to layer 3 is actually a good idea

1695
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,799
so that's that's what we mean in this

1696
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,759
section um

1697
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,480
2.3.1 radioaccess protection and then

1698
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,960
2.3.2

1699
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,680
is the discussion on the wireless mesh

1700
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,559
and for this

1701
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,079
the two examples are wi-fi mesh and tach

1702
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:42,960
mesh

1703
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,200
uh for which we want to to provide

1704
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,839
end-to-end reliability and availability

1705
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,799
uh by using multiple paths basically and

1706
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,480
diversity and

1707
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,880
across all you know space diversity time

1708
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,839
diversity

1709
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,720
coding diversity um all the barrio

1710
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,520
functions blah

1711
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:04,720
uh true to true so yes we have still a

1712
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,680
prime statement

1713
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:10,240
a framework and an architecture piece

1714
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,599
um what we don't have right now

1715
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,039
is discussion on not only the the where

1716
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,160
to forward to

1717
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,960
but the when to forward which is really

1718
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,119
uh something that jacob's document

1719
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:26,799
uh hints us and effectively uh

1720
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,640
it makes a lot of sense to to signal

1721
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,359
that as well as part of the hints

1722
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:34,559
that the for instance the ad end

1723
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,799
the ingress could signal it could

1724
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,000
effectively signal

1725
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,200
what's the expected schedule for this

1726
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,880
packet so the packet would know if it's

1727
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:43,920
ahead of schedule

1728
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,880
or below in which case it needs to be

1729
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,559
accelerated

1730
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,760
so pascal can i just jump in very very

1731
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,920
very quickly there there's some very

1732
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,839
similar work that's happening in

1733
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,520
or you've got a lot of feedback um

1734
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,119
there's some similar work that's

1735
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,799
happening in the dtn working group which

1736
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,319
has actually come out of the

1737
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,799
delay tolerance deep space work where

1738
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:08,559
they have this concept called contact

1739
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,920
graph routing where your

1740
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,240
forwarding information base is augmented

1741
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:15,119
with

1742
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,240
contact times so they can

1743
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,119
know when an expected adjacency is going

1744
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:22,319
to form

1745
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,720
so it's effectively time to tabled it

1746
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,160
works well in deep space because you

1747
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,280
know where your probes are

1748
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,079
and we're talking minutes and hours but

1749
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,119
some of the

1750
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,119
theoretical work they've put in to

1751
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,240
making sure that as

1752
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,280
is actually watertight and

1753
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,680
mathematically sound could be

1754
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,799
reused a useful reference point um i'll

1755
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,799
try and send you some urls and and

1756
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,240
if you could put something on the

1757
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,839
mailing list break that would be

1758
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:46,480
excellent

1759
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,839
i was also wondering you know when you

1760
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,000
get those constellations of satellites

1761
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,520
and the kind of cross you know

1762
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,119
in the sky yeah that's that's all

1763
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,520
planned and you know when it is

1764
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,200
and they know exactly when the link

1765
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,160
comes up when the thing goes down

1766
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,039
now the the thing is with with those

1767
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,280
radios we're talking about it's more

1768
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,520
um it's more dealing with uncertainty

1769
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,280
than dealing with certainty

1770
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,960
like there are certain that the link

1771
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,559
will come up at this time and that it

1772
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,160
will go away at this other time

1773
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,920
we are completely uncertain that the

1774
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,599
next packet will fly through

1775
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,160
on this link so we actually leverage

1776
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,520
blindly a lot of diversity to cope with

1777
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,960
um the unknowns that caused this loss

1778
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,760
um so there there is a link between the

1779
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,200
two i don't know how far

1780
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,599
it can go or it's it's the double

1781
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,280
negative it's the moment where you

1782
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,119
you know there is no contact at this

1783
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,359
time so there's no point even attempting

1784
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:40,880
to send so it's it's

1785
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,359
pruning redundant leaves from your tree

1786
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:44,880
is the point

1787
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,520
so yes there is something coming just i

1788
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,039
just wonder how far i want to take this

1789
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,079
architecture

1790
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,400
but i can see why uh this intuition you

1791
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,240
have in mind i can see how interesting

1792
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,079
it is it's really interesting

1793
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:59,200
okay so um there was the discussion of

1794
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,720
splitting architecture framework on the

1795
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,319
mailing list

1796
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,440
with lou um and then we just said maybe

1797
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,880
splitting prime actually

1798
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,480
that's kind of what i did when i

1799
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,319
restructure 405

1800
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,599
which is i i basically uh put together

1801
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,039
the first sections on prime then our

1802
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,960
next section on framework as you can see

1803
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,480
section 3 and section 4 and architecture

1804
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,680
i'm not 100 sure

1805
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,200
how i mean you still need to be able to

1806
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,880
read something in the right order so you

1807
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,039
don't have to go back and forth between

1808
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,319
things if you have three documents um

1809
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,160
how can we make sure people read them in

1810
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,160
the right order and don't have to to go

1811
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,000
across all documents

1812
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,359
that that might be a bit tricky um

1813
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:48,480
and then i was just wondering if if you

1814
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,559
guys think we have a path to adoption

1815
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,240
and what needs to be done on the path to

1816
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,799
adoption so on on that note

1817
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,280
we have a milestone to produce a

1818
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,280
document of this sort i can't remember

1819
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,359
exactly what the charter calls it but i

1820
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,720
i think it calls it an architectural

1821
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,039
framework or something like that

1822
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,799
so we have a charter item to get this

1823
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:08,960
done and i think it makes sense

1824
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,760
prior to working on and i know the ads

1825
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,720
agree on this

1826
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,559
prior to working on actual

1827
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,480
implementations we need to have a clear

1828
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,440
idea of

1829
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,039
what we're building how we're building

1830
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,480
it and why we're building it

1831
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,720
so that's the problem statement the the

1832
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,480
analysis of the technologies and the

1833
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,000
general architecture

1834
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,280
so yeah i think a document

1835
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,039
some part of this document whether it

1836
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,799
gets split or whether it exists as one

1837
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:35,760
will prob ought to be um adopted by the

1838
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,240
working group

1839
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,839
and it looks like we have um also in the

1840
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:46,880
queue

1841
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,240
go ahead officer thank you

1842
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,680
my comment is regarding this document

1843
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,319
actually if i want to read this document

1844
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:56,799
and

1845
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:01,440
give comments on it or i need to

1846
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,720
make sure i read the requirements and

1847
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,000
uh use cases documents

1848
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,119
so i was expecting to

1849
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,839
listen to the requirements documents

1850
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:15,520
first which was

1851
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,880
in the end of the agenda today but uh

1852
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,920
usually this document in my opinion is

1853
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,000
the architecture that should be

1854
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,200
considered or looked

1855
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,319
at or indeed after we decide the

1856
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:29,359
requirements

1857
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,319
uh for the one documentary the

1858
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,839
requirements for the industry

1859
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,039
and the other is the use cases which has

1860
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,640
the same author

1861
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,599
uh mr bhaskar and i thank mr maskal very

1862
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,240
much

1863
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:46,240
for his participation and more than one

1864
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,559
document actually thank you very much

1865
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:49,839
thanks

1866
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,720
i i i agree after salaam and the working

1867
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,880
group is currently

1868
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:59,599
reorganizing the the the content it has

1869
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,079
so we've pulled the use cases out into a

1870
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,920
document which sort of captures

1871
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,119
requirements

1872
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,440
we uh the intention of the working group

1873
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,359
is not to perform not to produce a

1874
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,599
formal requirements document

1875
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,039
but to describe the problem space which

1876
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,120
may be this problem statement document

1877
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,040
or the problem statement may be enclosed

1878
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,319
in another document

1879
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,319
to describe the use cases which is

1880
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,359
driving the work uh and yes you're right

1881
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,759
the the structure is not entirely clear

1882
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,120
yet um

1883
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,880
none of these documents are a working

1884
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,319
group last call none of them are ready

1885
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,238
for publication and we are still

1886
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,600
massaging the the ordering and and how

1887
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,120
they are held together but you make a

1888
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,080
very valid point

1889
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:43,759
so i agree so um

1890
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:45,120
pascal is that everything because i'm

1891
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,799
watching the clock and

1892
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,439
uh i think that's covered all the time

1893
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,600
yes i mean there was

1894
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,520
we were taking questions already i'm

1895
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,719
done with my slides

1896
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,198
and i will send you push the updates on

1897
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,399
thank you

1898
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,880
tracker excellent and then we can come

1899
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,600
back to this

1900
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,759
at the end we've got uh a bit of open

1901
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,600
mic time at the end so we can certainly

1902
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:06,719
discuss

1903
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,399
as a working group where we think we are

1904
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:09,679
in terms of the various things that get

1905
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:10,479
presented

1906
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,960
following that which is why it's i

1907
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,158
thought it was relevant to have a bit

1908
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:15,759
longer on that piece

1909
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:21,120
eve do you have a comment

1910
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,920
except that we probably need to um uh

1911
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,080
stick to our schedule a little bit

1912
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,920
um i'll get i'll go fast on my

1913
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,480
presentation

1914
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,040
just um that was a great discussion and

1915
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,000
totally worth it

1916
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,040
um but you're right i'm

1917
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,080
watching the clock on this one so

1918
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,770
uh i'll jump straight on to

1919
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,920
[Music]

1920
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,759
uh my fairly quick presentation on

1921
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,479
dlip and what it means for the raw

1922
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,158
working group can you see those slides

1923
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,000
eve anyone i said yeah

1924
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,600
ah thank you you're breaking up a little

1925
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,040
bit eve sorry

1926
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,239
okay um okay so

1927
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:11,600
uh what is d-lab so d-lab is the dynamic

1928
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,880
link exchange protocol

1929
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,080
it is defined in rfc 8175

1930
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,199
and that is a standards track rfc so

1931
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,360
this is a standard this isn't an

1932
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,320
informational or experimental

1933
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,400
it was developed in mobile ad hoc

1934
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,320
networks in the many working group

1935
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,159
but we believe it has applicability

1936
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,080
outside of that working group

1937
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,320
it was originally developed to as a

1938
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,360
building block to

1939
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,239
solve problems within the man a remit

1940
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:38,800
but

1941
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,719
um having built it its uses

1942
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,040
i think go much further particularly of

1943
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,400
interest to raw

1944
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,120
um so i'm going to run through a very

1945
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,719
quick overview of what ddep is and what

1946
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:51,280
it does

1947
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,440
and then get on to where i think it ties

1948
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,360
into the work we're looking at within

1949
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,120
this working group and how it might be

1950
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,480
able to help us

1951
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,000
so at the simplest level d-lab is a

1952
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,199
uh it's a monitoring protocol that runs

1953
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,560
i'm pretty much reading the slides and i

1954
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,719
apologize so it's a monitoring protocol

1955
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:09,760
that runs between

1956
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,560
a rooting layer 3 device and its locally

1957
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,280
attached

1958
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,000
link layer wireless device in the

1959
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,239
terminology referred to as a modem

1960
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,120
and it allows that modem to say hey i'm

1961
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,719
doing stuff at link there

1962
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,640
i'm discovering terminals as they come

1963
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,640
online i'm monitoring the links i'm

1964
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,480
running my own control plane

1965
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,120
but here is the information i know so

1966
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,640
you the router

1967
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,880
can do cleverer things because i'm

1968
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,480
giving you understanding of what the

1969
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,719
link layer is doing

1970
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:41,280
so there's a critical component to this

1971
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,840
which is

1972
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,080
it isn't an over-the-air protocol d-lab

1973
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,360
does not run

1974
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,920
over the wireless medium it's simply a

1975
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,840
monitoring protocol that runs between

1976
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,560
the router

1977
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,679
over probably an ethernet cable to

1978
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:56,080
the the land side effectively of the

1979
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:56,800
modem

1980
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,640
allow it so instead of having to rely on

1981
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,320
snmp or net conf

1982
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,800
and polling the box to say what

1983
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,640
terminals can you see what's your signal

1984
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,320
to noise ratio whatever

1985
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,640
it's a live protocol which allows the

1986
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,640
modem to have a richer conversation with

1987
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,320
the router about the state of the

1988
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,400
wireless network

1989
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,640
um since it was published in 2019

1990
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,760
and since then it's got good adoption

1991
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,560
within the radio and network vendors so

1992
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,480
your usual router guys

1993
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,239
have implementations most of them i

1994
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:29,920
don't think juniper does but

1995
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,920
i'm sure someone will correct me a lot

1996
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,920
of the radio manufacturers the big guys

1997
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,239
particularly in the defense markets

1998
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:39,199
are implementing dlip on most of their

1999
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,560
radios

2000
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,920
and that is mostly driven by the latest

2001
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,320
trash of large government contracts that

2002
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,000
are particularly in the us and the eu

2003
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,440
are starting to specify

2004
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,080
dlab as part of their procurement for

2005
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,120
radio and

2006
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:56,080
future combat radio systems um simply

2007
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,159
because it's an open standard and it

2008
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:58,800
allows

2009
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,560
these large agencies to avoid vendor

2010
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,080
lock-in so they can avoid buying a big

2011
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,840
vertical solution from one of your

2012
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,159
well-known vendors and they can start to

2013
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:10,400
cherry-pick radios and routers from

2014
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,440
people who make

2015
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,040
really good routers and people who make

2016
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,199
really good radios rather than people

2017
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:15,600
who

2018
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,760
target the defense industry so from a

2019
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:18,719
customer perspective

2020
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:21,040
they like it and it seems to uh it seems

2021
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,480
to work for them

2022
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,520
and it's an okay technology i mean i

2023
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,040
disclaimer i'm one of the authors of

2024
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:30,239
dlab so i think it's good obviously

2025
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,440
um so what does dnap actually provide

2026
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,840
really it gives you two things it gives

2027
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:37,679
you reachability information

2028
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,280
so when a new radio device comes

2029
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,480
on channel the

2030
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,960
your local modem will tell its attached

2031
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,320
router and say hey

2032
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,640
a new terminals come online if you send

2033
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,159
me um

2034
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,560
ethernet frames they'll pop out at the

2035
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,760
other end

2036
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,920
because i've told you i can do that so

2037
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,520
you don't need to go and do

2038
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,880
arping or pinging or polling or any sort

2039
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,719
of oam

2040
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,199
ippm style stuff to work out if someone

2041
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:08,560
is on the other end

2042
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:10,239
the link layer has already discovered it

2043
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:11,679
because it's done all its link their

2044
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:12,159
channel

2045
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,199
frequency stuff that it does it's

2046
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:15,840
already worked

2047
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:18,239
out so you get an event to say that

2048
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,320
destination is now there

2049
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,800
and these destinations are logical it's

2050
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:23,840
not just

2051
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:25,280
there's another router over there with

2052
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,080
its mac address you can also talk about

2053
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,520
multicast uh groups as well as logical

2054
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,880
destinations so

2055
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,800
hey a number of devices within this

2056
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,320
radio net are all using

2057
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,120
this multicast group are you interested

2058
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,320
in that

2059
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,320
um raising your hand did you want to

2060
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,120
jump in and comment

2061
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,440
nope nope okay okay

2062
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,320
um the other bit of information i'm

2063
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,559
sorry

2064
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,159
um yeah yeah rick uh i'm sorry but to

2065
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,600
the previous point you were describing

2066
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,440
the lips operating between the router

2067
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,480
and the modem over

2068
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,800
this ethernet which is yes also remember

2069
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,560
that the original use case but

2070
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,600
um i've seen rfc which i found

2071
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,960
critically important um where it's

2072
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,640
it could actually be over something

2073
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,159
logical like over a tunnel

2074
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,600
the one where you describe the idea

2075
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,199
which is not a mac address

2076
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,120
do you intend to discuss to discuss it

2077
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,719
because i think it's kind of fundamental

2078
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:27,120
for

2079
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:31,280
what one do here um yes i i can i can

2080
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,480
touch on that at the end i've

2081
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:33,679
intentionally kept this

2082
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,120
fairly simple and fairly to the point

2083
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,560
but um yeah uh

2084
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,280
at the basic level it's a simple ip

2085
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:44,159
connection it does

2086
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,480
the the protocol runs over tcp it's it's

2087
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,520
that simple

2088
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,960
um my point was this is

2089
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:54,560
not an over-the-air oam protocol

2090
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,360
oh yeah so so the session terminates at

2091
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,679
the local wireless

2092
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,280
um device it does it

2093
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:05,440
the observer the router could actually

2094
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,360
be a remote like if i have this mesh in

2095
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,320
front of your

2096
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,560
graph that i described i could i could

2097
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,040
call every damn router along the way and

2098
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,440
ask them to tell me what they see

2099
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,679
um no it actually prohibits that

2100
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:18,719
behavior

2101
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:22,560
okay it uses uh gtsm to enforce

2102
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,880
one hop for the d-lap session if you

2103
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,760
wish to if you wish to communicate with

2104
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,440
remote uh modems that are multiple hops

2105
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,960
away you need to go and use another

2106
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,000
protocol it's not

2107
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,239
designed for that and we did that

2108
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,880
intentionally because

2109
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,800
that's the wrong way to think about what

2110
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,080
dlap is for

2111
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,679
ddep is designed to do one thing only

2112
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:48,480
which is give you local information

2113
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:50,400
about your local device if you wish to

2114
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,760
build a big picture

2115
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,239
go use another protocol dlip is an input

2116
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,199
to that protocol

2117
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,600
it is not the solution at that layer but

2118
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,360
we could have some aggregating protocol

2119
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,239
that could

2120
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:03,360
yeah information for every app and bring

2121
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,960
that

2122
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,320
yeah that's slide eight i'll come to

2123
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,600
that on slide eight

2124
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,080
but absolutely this is just a building

2125
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:12,640
block

2126
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,719
for those systems um classic ietf we

2127
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,640
tried to keep it simple so we could get

2128
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,280
an actual rfc without boiling the ocean

2129
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,719
for 10 years

2130
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:25,679
um so as well as reachability

2131
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,000
information dlip will also allow a modem

2132
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,840
to communicate to its locally attached

2133
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,520
router and say what is the

2134
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,600
capability of these logical links

2135
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,440
between modems

2136
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,640
so i can see node a can see

2137
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,719
node b and i can tell you what the

2138
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,560
bandwidth over that link is i can tell

2139
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,400
you what the latency over that link is i

2140
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,679
can tell you what the theoretical

2141
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:46,320
maximum

2142
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,560
given the negotiated protocol parameters

2143
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,920
we're using

2144
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,360
and there's some other information such

2145
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:54,560
as the mtu quite useful for working out

2146
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,280
how big your packets can be obviously

2147
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,640
and some other things such as the

2148
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,080
resource consumption and

2149
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,159
relative link quality which are a little

2150
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:03,280
bit

2151
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,480
heuristic and a bit estimated haven't

2152
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,480
actually resulted in particularly useful

2153
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,320
metrics when implemented but

2154
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,960
that's that's an aside lou did you want

2155
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,360
to

2156
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,080
comment on that

2157
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,000
actually going to comment in response to

2158
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,480
pascal's question or comment

2159
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,920
excuse me so uh dlapp is really like lmp

2160
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,360
or link management protocol in the

2161
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,199
optical space that came out of

2162
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:32,960
the c-camp work and in that environment

2163
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,520
um uh the solution does exactly what

2164
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:37,600
pascal says is it collects information

2165
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,040
from lmp and then that

2166
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,199
information can be passed around through

2167
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,400
uh gmpls

2168
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,920
um te extensions so um

2169
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,920
like when i sent on the list it we can

2170
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,440
leverage what's been done in the past

2171
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,600
with pce and t's this is exactly what

2172
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,719
i'm talking about is

2173
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,920
that exact approach uh pascal that you

2174
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,239
were

2175
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:57,600
asking about has actually been

2176
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,440
implemented for but albeit for different

2177
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,199
technologies

2178
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,640
and and i would love to see this

2179
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,280
presentation from you lou talking about

2180
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,400
c-camp and ltp because i think it's

2181
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,000
you could pretty much cut and paste the

2182
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,239
word link manager

2183
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,880
sorry um you know that was a niche

2184
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,080
protocol most of those

2185
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,360
have gone away with um uh

2186
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,640
that that came from the days when

2187
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,320
optical line systems or ols's were

2188
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,320
separate now they're integrated into the

2189
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,000
into the routers with integrated

2190
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,480
photonics or you know tunable optics

2191
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,600
um but it's the same principle uh

2192
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,640
how about instead of i put the

2193
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,480
presentation together i'll put it into

2194
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,400
the architecture document with

2195
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,000
work with pascal even better um

2196
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,719
okay so i i'll keep going on this one

2197
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:43,679
just to keep quick

2198
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:46,800
so key points uh dlip is dynamic

2199
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,040
uh it's i think it's worth reiterating

2200
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:49,920
this

2201
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,159
yes you could probably just use a

2202
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,760
standard management protocol

2203
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,000
such as snmp or netconf to poll the

2204
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,760
status of your modem

2205
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,360
and get the metrics that the um

2206
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,199
that the modem is already recording for

2207
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:04,480
its own management and monitoring

2208
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:06,080
purposes

2209
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,360
however d-lab being session-based allows

2210
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,480
an event-driven model so the the modem

2211
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,159
can

2212
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,480
as these events occur at the link layer

2213
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,880
can signal back to the router to say hey

2214
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,719
that logical link i've told you about

2215
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:22,480
earlier the characteristics of that link

2216
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:25,760
have now changed you might want to react

2217
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,880
it's a more efficient way of

2218
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,120
implementing it also focuses the

2219
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,639
protocol to talk about

2220
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:33,520
a known standardized set of metrics in

2221
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,120
known standardized terms

2222
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,400
rather than relying on every radio

2223
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,000
implementing the same mib

2224
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,400
or a yang model or whatever

2225
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,239
so that's the third bullet on this page

2226
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:48,000
which is the link capabilities

2227
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,159
are we define them in terms that make

2228
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:51,679
sense to a router

2229
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:54,000
so a lot of the radios out there they're

2230
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,920
developed by very smart people who know

2231
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,760
an awful lot about

2232
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,400
radio technologies and their life

2233
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:03,199
revolves around signal-to-noise ratios

2234
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,280
symbol rates bit error rates and all

2235
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,120
this crazy physics stuff that i didn't

2236
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,679
study at university

2237
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:11,440
and translating that into something a

2238
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,440
router can make sense of

2239
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,600
is not obvious if your background is

2240
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,120
networking

2241
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,960
but the dlip protocol specifies that

2242
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,800
your implementation

2243
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,120
will talk about these things in terms

2244
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,400
that a root and

2245
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,040
can understand and a poor network

2246
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,320
engineer such as myself

2247
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,960
can immediately take and do clever ip

2248
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,080
stuff with

2249
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,600
so it it acts as an abstraction layer

2250
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,400
in terms of forcing the radio vendors to

2251
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,159
convert their data into

2252
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:44,159
information that is meaningful at layer

2253
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,520
3 and that

2254
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,000
that it seems quite subtle and pedantic

2255
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,920
but it is incredibly useful when you're

2256
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,800
trying to

2257
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,600
integrate heterogeneous radio systems

2258
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,320
from many

2259
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:57,679
many different vendors into contiguous

2260
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,560
layer 3 paths across the network so

2261
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,840
going back to pascal's point about

2262
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,719
taking packets and duplicating across 5g

2263
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:07,010
and

2264
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:08,239
[Music]

2265
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:11,280
802.11 wi-fi seven

2266
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,560
this gives you a mechanism where both

2267
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,520
uh link layers are starting to report

2268
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,600
their capabilities and characteristics

2269
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,440
in

2270
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:24,480
consistent uh metrics so

2271
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,840
you can now compare radio mesh

2272
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,400
a's values to radio mesh b's values

2273
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,760
because they are both

2274
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,080
agreed on what those values mean it's

2275
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,840
it's really handy for an implementation

2276
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,679
detail

2277
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,120
okay so dlip is also extensible so

2278
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:45,600
uh the rfc 8175 uh describes the dlap

2279
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,360
core protocol which includes the

2280
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,560
extension mechanism

2281
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,320
the core protocol is the general

2282
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,159
protocol session establishment

2283
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:55,360
security announcement discovery all that

2284
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,560
good stuff

2285
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,360
and then the actual capabilities and

2286
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,719
information

2287
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,440
uh it defines a small common subset and

2288
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:04,960
a mechanism to say

2289
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,800
hey i do this extra standardized

2290
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,639
extension and it describes how one

2291
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:12,080
standardizes them through the

2292
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:14,719
ietf or it's possible for other seos to

2293
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,400
do it this is iana's

2294
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,000
bread and butter um so

2295
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,480
uh extensions can be introduced after

2296
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,960
the release of 8175 without having to

2297
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,760
produce d lab v2 dfv3 dlip v4

2298
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,040
etc so there's a bunch of extensions

2299
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:32,159
that are being worked on

2300
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,400
currently a d-lap is worked on in the

2301
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,840
money working group which will be

2302
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,560
meeting on

2303
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,239
friday for those of you who want to

2304
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:40,719
deeper dive into into

2305
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,560
working on d-lab extensions there is

2306
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,080
going to be a big discussion there

2307
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,600
including luca and lou and myself

2308
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,880
some of the extensions that are going on

2309
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,360
at the moment so there's a

2310
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,800
layer 3 extension so when you're

2311
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,560
this touches a little bit on what pascal

2312
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,080
was mentioning

2313
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,199
you can treat a layer a set of layer 3

2314
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:06,080
tunnels such as an nbma

2315
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:09,360
vpn network where you know you're

2316
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,520
building ipsec tunnels in a sort of

2317
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,040
sd-wan solution you can model that

2318
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,760
as a wireless network and dlap is

2319
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,760
applicable at that but it needs a bit of

2320
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:20,639
handling

2321
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:22,320
and there's an extension to make it work

2322
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,760
in that model

2323
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,679
there is also another extension to allow

2324
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,440
you to talk about credit based flow

2325
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:28,000
control

2326
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,400
so you can rate limit the amount of data

2327
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,080
you're battering your wireless network

2328
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:32,639
with

2329
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,639
it gives the modem the ability to push

2330
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,400
back against the router and say

2331
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,000
hey slow down my my radio medium just

2332
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,679
cannot handle that gigabit of data

2333
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:44,480
you're shocking at me

2334
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,920
there's also some interesting work which

2335
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,040
is actually lou is working on

2336
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,679
which is to do with instead of just

2337
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,440
talking about the logical link between

2338
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,960
different destinations

2339
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,000
but to subdivide that logical link into

2340
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,719
different traffic classes and flows and

2341
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,639
to talk about

2342
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,000
so if you've got a radio that does some

2343
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,400
clever things the priority based queuing

2344
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,000
you can specify some some traffic flows

2345
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:10,639
have

2346
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,040
better latency or lower latency than

2347
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,960
other traffic flows

2348
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:16,880
this is starts to become of interest to

2349
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,880
raw so you could have a debt net style

2350
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,120
traffic classification where you have

2351
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,800
the time sensitive data

2352
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,520
and the best effort data and then you

2353
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,080
your dlab capable modem could say

2354
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,199
this tsm style time sensitive data

2355
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,679
has the following properties but my best

2356
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:36,560
effort is just

2357
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,080
it's kind of currently running at about

2358
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,760
this rate because that's how much spare

2359
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,080
time

2360
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,840
i have in my channel allocation or my

2361
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,320
tdma cycles or whatever

2362
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,040
um there's some there's an extension

2363
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,639
coming out to actually reflect some of

2364
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,320
the basic radio properties

2365
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:52,800
this is more interesting in manet than i

2366
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,880
think in raw but it's coming out

2367
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,280
and there's some work which i'm still

2368
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,040
trying to get sorted about

2369
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:02,239
um a number of things such as uh

2370
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,800
pim for multicast there's the concept of

2371
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,960
rendezvous point selection

2372
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,120
it makes very little sense to elect a

2373
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,159
node in

2374
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:13,199
a mesh network by

2375
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:16,320
uh a leader election using node id and

2376
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,639
picking the lowest mathematical number

2377
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,920
if the link layer

2378
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,920
if you select your rendezvous point

2379
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,760
without an understanding of the topology

2380
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,199
that the link layer is building

2381
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:29,679
you can choose a very bad rendezvous

2382
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,760
point very simple very easily

2383
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,199
but i'll go into a lot more of that

2384
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:35,040
information in melee

2385
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:38,480
um so this is the important point

2386
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:41,920
why is this useful to raw so

2387
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,679
in the raw architecture if you if you

2388
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,840
distill it down to the to the

2389
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,480
novel things that pascal is introducing

2390
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:52,000
the concept of a path selection element

2391
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,960
is is really very interesting that's the

2392
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,880
that's the logical entity

2393
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,600
that understands the plan that has come

2394
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,280
down from the path computation element

2395
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:01,920
in terms of

2396
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,679
this track and this track and this track

2397
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:05,440
where a track is the

2398
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,239
deterministic flow and the path

2399
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:09,440
selection elements

2400
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,560
job is to understand what the wireless

2401
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,760
system is doing

2402
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,159
and try and apply that policy to the

2403
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:18,080
forwarding of packets in order to

2404
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:21,600
meet the demands of that policy

2405
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,760
so unless the underlying link layer

2406
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,679
network does tsn already

2407
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:27,440
and if it does that's great you can say

2408
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:32,080
hey low-level ieee tsn or or

2409
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,800
5g or whatever go do your thing because

2410
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,639
i know you will support it and therefore

2411
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:37,760
i can agree with

2412
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,360
the constraints that are applied on me

2413
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,280
as the path selection element

2414
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,840
if it doesn't the path selection element

2415
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:44,880
has to understand

2416
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,880
what the wireless medium is currently

2417
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,080
capable of

2418
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,080
in order to work out what to do in order

2419
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,600
to maintain those deterministic

2420
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,199
conditions

2421
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:56,960
and dlab can provide a generic mechanism

2422
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,840
to do that

2423
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,239
so implementations currently exist

2424
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,480
using dlip to provide stability in

2425
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,040
mayonnaise so again it's using that

2426
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,440
pushback from the modem to understand

2427
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,360
what's actually happening in the radio

2428
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,000
environment

2429
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,080
in order to provide stability in these

2430
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,239
really ad hoc networks

2431
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:19,600
that same mechanism can be reused

2432
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,920
to provide determinism in much more

2433
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,600
controlled environments so

2434
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,280
factory floor or amusement parks or you

2435
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,000
know these aren't

2436
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,360
mayonnaise but they are definitely

2437
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,440
wireless and they still suffer from

2438
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,120
interference and atmospherics and all

2439
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,880
this kind of thing

2440
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,159
so the links wobble but not

2441
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:42,000
too badly so dlip gives that

2442
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,360
real-time control loop

2443
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:48,800
back to the pse so the psa

2444
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,560
can use that information in order to

2445
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,040
make the smart deterministic decisions

2446
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,360
and and that's my pitch for why

2447
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,920
d-networks for raw

2448
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,960
last slide uh nearly last slide there's

2449
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,679
a

2450
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,440
d-lab has a dirty little secret which is

2451
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,120
the link characteristics request which

2452
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:05,600
is an

2453
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,400
unused or underused function which

2454
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,800
allows a router to make a request

2455
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,000
back to the modem to say i know this

2456
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,400
logical link is only running a

2457
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,800
14 megabits and has 200 milliseconds of

2458
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,080
latency on it

2459
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,080
i'd really like it to be 100

2460
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,199
milliseconds

2461
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,679
and i really want a bit more bandwidth

2462
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:27,760
and the modem has an opportunity to try

2463
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,120
and apply that

2464
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,880
using whatever link their technology it

2465
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,120
has available or to refuse it

2466
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,520
it can say you know you're not allowed

2467
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,639
to do that

2468
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,199
for policy or physics won't allow us to

2469
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:40,080
do that because

2470
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:44,159
we're in a tunnel or whatever but

2471
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:46,480
this could be the it could be a useful

2472
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,520
mechanism

2473
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,159
in a raw context for the path selection

2474
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,080
element to say

2475
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,040
i'm being requested to pin down a track

2476
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,639
with these criteria

2477
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:59,920
hey modem can you do this

2478
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:02,000
so this is something i think is worth

2479
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,280
exploring but

2480
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,040
again i think protein are offline and

2481
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,440
have an extended discussion if needed

2482
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,199
so next steps

2483
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:14,159
does this discussion of dlab need to be

2484
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,719
included in the technologies draft

2485
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,120
so this isn't a link there technology

2486
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:19,760
this is an

2487
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,350
ietf protocol but it does

2488
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:23,600
[Music]

2489
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,159
add potentially to sort of the raw

2490
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,280
toolbox

2491
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,920
does this live in the technologies draft

2492
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,880
does it live in the problem statement

2493
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,360
i know pascal's architecture draft has a

2494
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,159
section called

2495
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:39,120
existing ietf work does it exist there

2496
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,040
do we even want this documented

2497
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:43,520
or do we say there's an rfc it's an ietf

2498
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,199
thing with the ietf

2499
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:49,120
go look it up um my other question

2500
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,480
is do we see

2501
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,600
any raw requirements that might require

2502
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:56,880
an extension

2503
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,800
to delap to be written so

2504
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,000
are there things that a pse

2505
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,239
would like to use the d-lap protocol to

2506
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,679
do that are currently

2507
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:13,440
not in the scope of d-lab so

2508
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,280
is there some way that it would be like

2509
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,719
to uh

2510
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:18,639
write a d-lap extension which allows a

2511
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,199
radio sub a radio system to say hey

2512
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:24,080
i have a tsm capability and it is

2513
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,120
described as

2514
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,760
blah blah blah that would be a very

2515
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,639
obvious deal up extension so a

2516
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:33,920
a raw capable uh rooting network device

2517
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,880
would be able to talk to a an attached

2518
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:37,520
modem

2519
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,320
over a d-lap protocol and deal and over

2520
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,080
that protocol it would learn that hey

2521
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,080
that radio i'm attached to has a has a

2522
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:47,120
has a tsn function so great let's use

2523
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:47,520
that

2524
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,000
and let the radio go do the tsn stuff

2525
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:51,600
meaning the psc doesn't have to worry

2526
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:52,400
too much about

2527
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,040
uh all the perio functions because the

2528
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:58,400
link there's doing it which is great

2529
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,800
we have a couple of uh uh folks in the

2530
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,080
queue we are

2531
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,920
running short on time so i would ask

2532
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,840
them to be very concise

2533
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,679
and carlos i know you're you're next in

2534
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,760
the uh speaking

2535
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,800
queue uh for the presentations so

2536
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,800
particularly if you could um ask your

2537
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,280
question quickly that'd be great

2538
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:21,360
sorry sure very good question and

2539
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,520
i'm i'm familiar with the lab so my my

2540
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:24,800
question may make no sense so i

2541
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,480
apologize for that but

2542
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,440
what is that about i i wondering about

2543
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,560
the use of the lab

2544
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:33,760
for oim in general i don't know if

2545
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,520
something was done but applicability in

2546
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,280
raw i think that that could be useful as

2547
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,480
well

2548
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,800
uh it's something uh it hasn't been

2549
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,080
addressed in monet

2550
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,199
um it's something i obviously see

2551
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:48,880
it's i i think working with some of the

2552
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:49,760
oam

2553
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,600
uh ippm link sensing uh

2554
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,840
hop by hop stuff as compared to the path

2555
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,440
stuff i think it has definitely has a

2556
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,159
path to

2557
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:01,360
a part to play so instead of having to

2558
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,000
run

2559
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,120
uh om end to end you may find

2560
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,520
some segments within that path maybe

2561
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,880
d-let capable

2562
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,440
and you might be able to effectively

2563
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:12,480
spoof the

2564
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,520
oam ippm style probes

2565
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,239
across that link very interesting i

2566
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:19,840
don't know whether the raw working group

2567
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,440
is the right place maybe bring it to

2568
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,880
manet maybe we can

2569
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,040
take it on somewhere else but yeah very

2570
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,560
happy to talk about that

2571
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,040
lou may have an opinion on this as well

2572
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:29,920
um

2573
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,960
so yeah yeah okay

2574
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,719
thanks internalists

2575
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,960
if you could i think this is a deal is

2576
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,199
just one example of you know

2577
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,800
exchanging between the layer three

2578
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,199
device and they the underlying layer too

2579
01:33:45,199 --> 01:33:46,880
right so if yeah i think the

2580
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:49,440
group wants to be architecturally clean

2581
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,040
there should be you know a protocol

2582
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:51,920
independent

2583
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:54,639
definition of the information that for

2584
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,719
raw is of interest to be exchanged and

2585
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:59,199
then an instance of that can be done

2586
01:33:59,199 --> 01:34:02,400
with dlab but if architectural clarity

2587
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,920
and that's exactly the tool set we were

2588
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:05,600
talking in before about right

2589
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,679
and if if if you folks don't want to do

2590
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:09,440
that in a clean fashion then just hack

2591
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,840
everything into the lab yeah

2592
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,159
yeah so my comeback on that is i

2593
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:15,840
completely agree and actually

2594
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,000
debt net has done a pretty good job of

2595
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,440
defining

2596
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,239
um latency and maximum latency i can't

2597
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,360
remember the rfc

2598
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,199
or the draft that it's in but starting

2599
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,199
and it's also very much abstracting from

2600
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,840
let's say only tsns the only known

2601
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,480
you know subnet technology that provides

2602
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:34,080
um functionality right so that

2603
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,719
abstraction doesn't really exist so far

2604
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,199
yeah sorry when i used the word tsn i i

2605
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:40,159
was just

2606
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:43,199
i i stole the acronym to mean

2607
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:44,639
some kind of layer two which does

2608
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:46,480
time-sensitive networking rather than

2609
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,560
the explicit ieee

2610
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,280
tsn implementation i i meant some sort

2611
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,960
of a deterministic layer too

2612
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,639
sorry but yes i i agree there is

2613
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,639
dlap is an example of something that

2614
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:01,040
should probably be more generic and and

2615
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,280
possibly be inheriting metrics

2616
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,239
through from that net because i can see

2617
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:07,280
people building

2618
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:10,480
very big networks where a lot of it is

2619
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,560
traditional wired.net

2620
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,320
with raw segments within it

2621
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:18,800
as soon as we build raw based industrial

2622
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:19,440
networks

2623
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,480
someone is going to want to

2624
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,239
deterministically connect them together

2625
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:23,040
nationally

2626
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,280
well but devnet is by now from the

2627
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,400
service uh

2628
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,639
fairly limited and i think that raw is a

2629
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,560
lot more you know dynamic with respect

2630
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,760
to bandwidth

2631
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:33,719
even with respect to you know

2632
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:35,119
probabilistically

2633
01:35:35,119 --> 01:35:37,679
uh defined latency as opposed to only

2634
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:38,159
you know

2635
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:41,679
100 bounded so i'd be careful in raw to

2636
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:43,600
constrain yourself to only what is

2637
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,760
currently within scope of that net

2638
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:48,560
i agreed uh there's a feedback loop with

2639
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,280
debt net

2640
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,280
so the raw chairs meet with the debt net

2641
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,719
chairs every two weeks

2642
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:55,679
and i see quite a healthy feedback and

2643
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,199
lou is about to jump in and contradict

2644
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:58,719
me but

2645
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:01,440
but yeah we see that as we can kind of

2646
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,280
push back into debt net and say

2647
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,000
you've got to think bigger because we're

2648
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,760
thinking bigger and we're very much part

2649
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:09,679
of the deterministic family

2650
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:12,719
so yeah i would like to uh

2651
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,719
be considerate of the amount of time for

2652
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,400
our last couple of months

2653
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,360
so i would like to um cut the queue um

2654
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,520
and take some of the questions to the

2655
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,840
mailing list and or the chat window

2656
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:29,440
right i shall stop sharing go ahead

2657
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:39,839
carlos all yours

2658
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,320
okay i hope you can you can see in the

2659
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:43,199
slides and

2660
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:46,080
hear me well we can okay thanks i try to

2661
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,119
be brief for

2662
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,800
to allow for having time for the next

2663
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,199
speaker so this is just a couple of

2664
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:52,960
topics to discuss one default is on the

2665
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,480
raw use cases

2666
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,600
just a sort of taped on the document so

2667
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,280
as you know we have the different use

2668
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,639
cases covered in this

2669
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:02,880
document i'll they are listed there on

2670
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,000
on the slide

2671
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,840
and for each of the the use cases

2672
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,199
basically we

2673
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:09,360
we follow the following structure so far

2674
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,760
we describe describe the use case the

2675
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,239
specifics the challenges

2676
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,360
the need for wireless and then the

2677
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,400
requirements for raw and this

2678
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,639
leads to the next and important slide

2679
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:23,040
the one that i wanted to discuss today

2680
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,119
that is on the one hand well there have

2681
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,280
been not many updates since last its

2682
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,239
cycle and i

2683
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:31,040
take the blame for that i'll apologize

2684
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,800
i'll try to

2685
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,360
to uh do more more or update the content

2686
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,520
for the next uh before the next atf and

2687
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:40,800
for that one thing i

2688
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,880
need is of course input from the working

2689
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,560
group remember that this document is for

2690
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,679
the working group now

2691
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:48,560
so i'm just trying to get the consensus

2692
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,040
and put that in the document so please

2693
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:55,760
provide input but in addition to this

2694
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:57,920
one thing that we discussed last time is

2695
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,760
that we have to

2696
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:01,199
collaborate and align a bit the

2697
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:02,800
terminology with the raw architecture

2698
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,360
one

2699
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,600
the document so i i will be in contact

2700
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,480
with the guys

2701
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,239
uh working on the other already in the

2702
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:10,639
other document to ensure that

2703
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:12,480
and another thing that we must ensure

2704
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,840
based on the agreement that we had in

2705
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,800
the last itf

2706
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,800
is that this use cases document is

2707
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,080
basically also including the

2708
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:18,880
requirements

2709
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,440
that's something that was discussed and

2710
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,880
agreed last time

2711
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,480
so we have a section for that but we

2712
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,400
need to ensure that we are

2713
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,440
properly doing the job of

2714
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,719
incorporating or covering the

2715
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,600
requirements part in this document

2716
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,800
and then related to this there is the

2717
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,159
discussion about the draft that is going

2718
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,920
to be presented next that

2719
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,080
i think is a very interesting document

2720
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,360
that is specific

2721
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,840
on the requirements for industrial uh

2722
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,119
kind of uh

2723
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,679
use case or a scenario and there's been

2724
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:50,880
some discussion on the main

2725
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,639
list whether we should incorporate

2726
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,360
even a compressed version of those

2727
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,400
requirements

2728
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,600
in the use case since we have

2729
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,440
requirements in the use case document

2730
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,080
or to merge or to not to do anything or

2731
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:04,719
do an

2732
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:07,760
any other thing i'm perfectly fine of

2733
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:08,480
course with

2734
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,600
any decision that we take i'm probably

2735
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,119
more inclined to

2736
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:15,920
the the option that pascal suggested

2737
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:17,679
about including a compressed version

2738
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,639
by leaving the other document leave and

2739
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:21,840
um

2740
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,840
be published as an independent document

2741
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,560
with all full details but i think for

2742
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:26,880
the

2743
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,920
also for the for the com the

2744
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,280
consistency of the use cases and

2745
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,040
requirement document we need to to

2746
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,400
include some part of a compressed

2747
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,119
version of this

2748
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:37,520
of it in the use cases but this is the

2749
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:38,719
main question i have for the working

2750
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:39,520
loop

2751
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,840
to trigger this now and of course do it

2752
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,400
on the main list whether you think

2753
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,000
we should include a compressed version

2754
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,920
merge with the other one or do nothing

2755
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:50,080
or any other approach that you may have

2756
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,080
and and i would like to stop here for

2757
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:53,679
this particular part and then i will go

2758
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:57,280
into the second part of my presentation

2759
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,760
so carlos i've taken a note that

2760
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,920
the chairs will ask on the list exactly

2761
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:07,440
that question just to kick off that

2762
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,080
discussion

2763
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:13,040
okay okay perfect thank you very much

2764
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,159
okay so if there are no questions with

2765
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,560
these related use cases

2766
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,040
then let me move into the second part

2767
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:23,920
there is uh individual submissions

2768
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:26,320
about rohan and mech multi-access edge

2769
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,760
computing as

2770
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,080
rick introduced in the in the

2771
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,320
presentation or in the in the

2772
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,400
shared slides at the beginning so i will

2773
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:36,159
not go into the details this is just

2774
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:38,639
more to trigger discussion or to gather

2775
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:40,080
whether there is interest in this kind

2776
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:40,719
of

2777
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,239
work in in the raw uh working group

2778
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:46,320
we have a couple of contributions so far

2779
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,920
and basically the

2780
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,360
the scope or the the aim of this is to

2781
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,920
explore the integration of pro and edge

2782
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:54,800
computing

2783
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,719
and we are adopting or we are taking as

2784
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:57,920
baseline the etsy

2785
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,679
mec architecture as baseline because

2786
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,960
this one that is being standardized

2787
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,840
and as i will try to go into a bit more

2788
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,440
details in the next slide

2789
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,280
we believe that there are use cases as

2790
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:10,719
also documented in the use cases

2791
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:11,440
document that

2792
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,080
uh that justify this kind of integration

2793
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,679
of row and edge computing and

2794
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,880
there may be things to consider both at

2795
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:19,199
the

2796
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,600
itf side and the etsy in this case for

2797
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,320
mec

2798
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,159
site to to do this integration and the

2799
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:26,159
idea will be whether to explore the atf

2800
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:26,960
side of those

2801
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,080
things in in atf or not

2802
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,080
so there are two documents so far the

2803
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:33,679
first one that is the draft bernardo's

2804
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:34,000
raw

2805
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,880
mec that is about extension to enable

2806
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:37,440
this

2807
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:40,080
integration or the use of raw

2808
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:41,920
technologies in a in a mech environment

2809
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,280
make deployment

2810
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:45,280
and then the second one which is about a

2811
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,040
more specific point that is how to

2812
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:47,920
enable

2813
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,440
the terminal to to do the selection

2814
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:55,040
of the in which mac hosting which

2815
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,800
server at the edge to deploy an

2816
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,960
application and configure the raw

2817
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:00,400
network connecting that

2818
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,560
at the same time that is a more specific

2819
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,639
thing and i will basically focus on the

2820
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:05,600
on the first one

2821
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,000
in the presentation today so the first

2822
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,280
document the scope is

2823
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,600
as i mentioned to integrate row and mac

2824
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:13,520
and we just defined the document that

2825
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:14,239
there are some

2826
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:16,320
scenarios for example industry 4.0

2827
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,320
considering 5g and the ultra

2828
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:22,480
reliable and low latency communications

2829
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,960
feature of 5g so the idea we have in

2830
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,480
mind is that we have a network with draw

2831
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,920
enable

2832
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,040
nodes and mec

2833
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,960
h platform its point of present whatever

2834
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:35,920
you want to call it

2835
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,040
in in etsy mag will be net platforms are

2836
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,119
collocated or attached to these raw

2837
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,080
nodes that are

2838
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,320
of course connected via multi multi-hope

2839
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:45,520
wireless

2840
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,480
and ibs that in this scenario we of

2841
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,440
course want to

2842
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:52,480
enable low latency to applications and

2843
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,600
we may have multiple

2844
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:55,119
platforms and we may have applications

2845
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:56,719
that may need to migrate from one

2846
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,159
platform to another platform

2847
01:42:58,159 --> 01:42:59,920
and those are connected wirelessly and

2848
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,679
this is where raw getting

2849
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,920
gets into the picture because by using a

2850
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:04,960
raw

2851
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,199
technology or raw deployment we will be

2852
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:08,880
able to ensure

2853
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,880
the raw requirements that they make

2854
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,560
applications requires

2855
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,000
not only from the beginning when you

2856
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,679
instantiate from the beginning or at the

2857
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:16,960
beginning of the application but also

2858
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,639
when you need to migrate an application

2859
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:19,600
due to

2860
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,400
whatever change in the network so that

2861
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,280
is the

2862
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,760
basically the the starting point and

2863
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,400
this is the

2864
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:27,920
the simplest scenario that we have in

2865
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,679
mind

2866
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,239
with that in mind we started working

2867
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,600
into a potential solution but this is

2868
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,920
just more for food for thoughts

2869
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,520
in terms of whether this makes sense or

2870
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,119
not by

2871
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:42,080
having a pro a specific entity in the

2872
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,119
mech platform

2873
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,840
that is what we call a controller that

2874
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,679
is basically the one computing what

2875
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:48,800
needs to be

2876
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,360
done or to be requested to the raw pc on

2877
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,920
the on the atf row side of things

2878
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:56,639
to enable and to configure the network

2879
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:58,000
between the raw

2880
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,440
nodes in order to volunteer the

2881
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,360
requirements of the mac application

2882
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,520
so that's that's the id and then we

2883
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,199
introduce some new semantics on the

2884
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:08,080
interface at the etsy side of things

2885
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,080
between the mac platform and this re

2886
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,119
this raw pc

2887
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,880
to to convey the request and

2888
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:14,480
synchronization the status

2889
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:16,719
the topology of our network and enable

2890
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:18,320
to configure this in

2891
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:21,679
near real time or real time

2892
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:24,080
the draft includes procedures for doing

2893
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,760
things like initial make application

2894
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,119
requests when we have an application and

2895
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:28,400
we want to deploy the application

2896
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,040
ensuring

2897
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,199
the characteristics for that traffic

2898
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,080
flow

2899
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,679
how to do this and how to interact with

2900
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:36,400
the raw pce and do things

2901
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:38,960
and then two other uh two procedures

2902
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,360
that are interesting from the iam side

2903
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,320
one is when we have raw iim triggering

2904
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,040
or or

2905
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,440
uh informing about a change in the raw

2906
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,440
network that may have an impact

2907
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,199
on the make application and that may

2908
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,280
trigger for example a migration from a

2909
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,360
mech from an edge server to another one

2910
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,040
how to integrate this

2911
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:59,520
that makes sense in a scenario like this

2912
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,520
and the other way around that is

2913
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,880
to use the information that make oam

2914
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,080
may be collecting also to influence

2915
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,159
on the raw configuration on how to

2916
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:11,520
update the raw configuration

2917
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,520
on the ronit so we have this three

2918
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,360
procedures so far described there with a

2919
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,960
potential solution but this as i

2920
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:18,080
mentioned is more

2921
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,760
food for thought and to see whether this

2922
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,920
is interesting in the world

2923
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,520
carlos and then we have the other one i

2924
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,199
will not go carlos

2925
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:28,000
do you think you could um wrap up uh yes

2926
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,199
this is the last minute

2927
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,000
yeah one minute so what i wanted to say

2928
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,080
that this another document is about a

2929
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,679
more specific point i will not go into

2930
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:38,800
the details because

2931
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,480
my main point is about the scenario not

2932
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,560
about the solutions yet

2933
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,119
and then the the summary or the wrap up

2934
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:46,960
is whether the question will be whether

2935
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,320
the working would think that there is

2936
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,719
interesting in exploring this kind of

2937
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,400
use cases and integration of

2938
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,760
technologies

2939
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,520
and to ask for feedback on the main list

2940
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:59,840
that's that's that's it from message

2941
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,639
rick i i think you're a mute or we're

2942
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:09,520
not hearing your

2943
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,760
audio but you look like you're speaking

2944
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:12,800
i'm speaking

2945
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,880
on mute it's typical isn't it carlos

2946
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,560
thank you i'm sorry to cut you short

2947
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:18,480
that was me talking far too long in my

2948
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,520
presentation

2949
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,679
i think this is personally i think this

2950
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:22,880
is really interesting work

2951
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:25,280
i think it's a little early to to work

2952
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,719
on detail

2953
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,159
but as a use case for how we want to use

2954
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,239
what we're trying to do in raw i think

2955
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:33,760
it's really important

2956
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:37,280
the ability to if we build

2957
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,679
interesting raw networks that apply this

2958
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:41,440
determinism the ability to

2959
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,080
export that information out to systems

2960
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,119
that use it

2961
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:48,159
and to take feedback from those sort of

2962
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:50,639
consumer systems whereas edge computes

2963
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:51,199
be

2964
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:54,480
whatever vital really useful so i

2965
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,199
i support this i'm not sure how much

2966
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:58,560
work we can do on this

2967
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,040
yet but i think it's really useful and

2968
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,639
thank you for that

2969
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:04,880
thanks

2970
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,880
so uh it's rooter isn't

2971
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:14,000
it excellent i'm sure i'm not

2972
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,639
pronouncing your name right

2973
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,960
i think you're pronouncing my name right

2974
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,880
thank you

2975
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,520
so my name is hoot like ruth in english

2976
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,520
yeah okay so i think you're seeing my

2977
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:32,159
slides right yes

2978
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:35,679
okay we are so thanks so first of all

2979
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:37,679
rink and if thanks for the last minute

2980
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:38,159
uh

2981
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:40,639
accept us on this okay and basically

2982
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:42,239
just to give a quick overview because i

2983
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,159
think there is a confusion okay which

2984
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:45,920
i'd like to clarify

2985
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:48,800
so in terms when we did this draft so me

2986
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,719
matias and paulo

2987
01:47:50,719 --> 01:47:52,719
what we felt and we did look into the

2988
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:54,000
use cases draft

2989
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
was that we needed some information

2990
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,760
about

2991
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,400
current current let's say services that

2992
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,159
are being or could be supported by

2993
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:04,000
wireless so the idea was actually

2994
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
okay we have we are having wireless

2995
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,360
being integrated into

2996
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,360
industrial environments manufacturing

2997
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,440
that's where i'm looking mostly but

2998
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:12,800
the other colleagues are looking into

2999
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,040
other scenarios and we have different

3000
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:16,880
flavors of wireless that we spoke about

3001
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,000
today that are important

3002
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,960
for raw but the fact is that we didn't

3003
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,600
have

3004
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,119
really a concrete measure in terms of

3005
01:48:23,119 --> 01:48:25,119
requirements sure everybody speaks about

3006
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:28,239
bounded legacy but that was mostly it

3007
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:30,800
and so in our case okay the motivation

3008
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,719
was okay we know that

3009
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,480
the the wireless infrastructure is going

3010
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:35,920
to be integrated of course

3011
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,679
into the the overall infrastructure that

3012
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,440
we have this means right now

3013
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,440
interconnected to

3014
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,080
5g fig core or interconnected to

3015
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:45,760
ethernet with tsms

3016
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,760
and therefore let's say our boundaries

3017
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,239
were okay how can we which requirements

3018
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:51,840
can we have how can we collect these

3019
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,920
requirements in different services

3020
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:56,719
so that what we built on wireless on

3021
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,239
detunistic wireless

3022
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,239
really meets uh what we have on the

3023
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:01,760
wired part

3024
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:03,760
and so in terms of the structure what we

3025
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,320
created was we looked we gathered

3026
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,239
from different sources looked into

3027
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:09,920
current services

3028
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,000
so meaning we also looked into use cases

3029
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,199
but we actually went

3030
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:15,040
to the services itself so there's a

3031
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:17,040
distinction between a use case and the

3032
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:17,840
service

3033
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,239
and basically we collected around 30

3034
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:22,239
services we grouped them into different

3035
01:49:22,239 --> 01:49:23,599
categories

3036
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:25,920
with concrete communication kpis so

3037
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,040
latency sure but

3038
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:30,400
others and then we said okay so that's

3039
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:31,920
basically what we have today

3040
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,440
what what is going to happen then

3041
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,440
discussing okay and this is more a point

3042
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:36,639
of view

3043
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,920
sort of uh individual from the authors

3044
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,880
what's next um um we're wondering

3045
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,880
whether you're displaying what you're

3046
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:47,040
speaking to and if you could make this

3047
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,480
bigger that would be great

3048
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,320
you go to presentation mode would be

3049
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,760
great because it's quite small

3050
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,239
on the screen yeah and so we did not see

3051
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:55,520
your slide two

3052
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:57,840
yeah as well and could you go into

3053
01:49:57,840 --> 01:49:59,440
presentation mode will that work with

3054
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,639
this tool

3055
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:03,040
for you

3056
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:06,719
so i'm trying to share this okay i

3057
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:11,840
have to click and

3058
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:18,239
so can you now see the slide larger

3059
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:22,840
um can you try the presentation mode in

3060
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:23,840
powerpoint at the

3061
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:26,880
bottom presentation

3062
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,719
we don't see it in presentation okay so

3063
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:30,400
rick do you want to share this yeah

3064
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:34,080
i'll i'll share oh chef that's fine

3065
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,960
thank you no trouble yeah no it's fine

3066
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:37,360
uh

3067
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,119
let me find the right window uh share

3068
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:41,600
yes

3069
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:44,639
[Music]

3070
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,280
there we go is that good yes so let's

3071
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,800
put it

3072
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,960
to

3073
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,080
yes okay no actually the next one sorry

3074
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,840
okay so basically the structure is still

3075
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,520
quite simple no no prior

3076
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:06,000
sorry rig right slightly

3077
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,159
okay so basically it's quite simple i

3078
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:09,679
said so basically we collected

3079
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:12,719
uh services that run or

3080
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,880
are where wireless in in this case is

3081
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,280
really short range wireless is mentioned

3082
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:17,920
okay

3083
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,560
and then we also divided on at least

3084
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:22,320
three examples of

3085
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,239
services that we think are coming in the

3086
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:26,080
in the short run

3087
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:29,199
and there of course we do work similar

3088
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:29,679
to the

3089
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:31,520
work that was done for the use cases but

3090
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:33,760
for services okay namely

3091
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,239
divide on recommendations how these

3092
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:38,239
services are expected to go for instance

3093
01:51:38,239 --> 01:51:38,719
whether

3094
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:41,119
adult will be present or not and then

3095
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:43,040
specific communication kpis

3096
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:46,000
next slides please

3097
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:49,040
so here you have an overview of the

3098
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,400
services that we collected and the

3099
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:51,360
sources

3100
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:53,280
uh even though that is not completely on

3101
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,040
the draft we have a report

3102
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:57,199
which later can be shared okay from a

3103
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:58,080
project

3104
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,320
uh really explaining where the services

3105
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,159
come from the different sources next

3106
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:04,799
slide please

3107
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:09,280
and so what you have on this slide is

3108
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,119
basically the collected information okay

3109
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:12,800
so what did we collect

3110
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,639
and so this of course goes for the

3111
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:17,040
regular reasons why we need wireless

3112
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:18,239
that's quite important okay in

3113
01:52:18,239 --> 01:52:20,159
particular with manufacturing

3114
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:23,599
and then so the regular kpis okay

3115
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:24,560
latency but

3116
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,639
also whether traffic is periodic or not

3117
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:27,760
the cycles if

3118
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,040
available that we need okay to support

3119
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,679
the payload size tolerance to packet

3120
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:35,440
loss time synchronization needs

3121
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,639
and whenever possible also aspects such

3122
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:38,960
as

3123
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:45,840
no density or an area next slide please

3124
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:49,119
okay so then an example okay so

3125
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:51,360
basically very simple example of

3126
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:54,000
an example of of today so i would say

3127
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,760
that we have a category so

3128
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,080
what we done was not a use guys so it's

3129
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:00,080
not an equipment and process control use

3130
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,199
guys it's actually

3131
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:02,960
a category of services that we have

3132
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,040
there okay and the services for instance

3133
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,719
control of machines and robots

3134
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:09,599
or plc programmable logical controller

3135
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:12,560
uh to plc communication and

3136
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:14,800
so this to say that these are not use

3137
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,320
cases okay so they are services and of

3138
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:16,960
course we can

3139
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:19,280
integrate them into the use cases but

3140
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:23,440
there's a distinction next slide please

3141
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:25,760
so on the second part of the draft which

3142
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,280
relates with the future

3143
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,840
but the near future what you have are

3144
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,719
again three examples of potential

3145
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,400
let's say industrial services that

3146
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,080
require require wireless

3147
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:39,199
and what we think will happen and for

3148
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:40,080
instance of course

3149
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,280
when we speak about industrial

3150
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:43,280
environments most of the wireless

3151
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,440
infrastructure is still uh

3152
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:47,440
centralized okay so it's infrastructure

3153
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,280
mode but we believe the other part is

3154
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,280
necessary and then if we go there

3155
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:54,639
what which which aspects we have to

3156
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,080
account for

3157
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,800
and also try as much as possible to

3158
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:01,119
provide specific apis

3159
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:04,320
uh next slide please

3160
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:08,480
so in terms of next and last slide okay

3161
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,000
so basically

3162
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
as said what we are what we have

3163
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,679
collected was

3164
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,000
a bunch of applications and it would be

3165
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,080
great to grow this database okay

3166
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:20,840
and categorize them provide specific

3167
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,159
apis

3168
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:25,599
it so i said within merge or not merge

3169
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:27,040
this is something that is so it's not a

3170
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,960
personal or individual perspective okay

3171
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,239
this is something that we have been

3172
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:30,719
asked

3173
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:32,560
often and often and often and i'm doing

3174
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,239
a project at several projects

3175
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:36,239
on deterministic wireless and then we

3176
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:37,840
have the same problem which is

3177
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,040
okay but where are our kpis okay

3178
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:42,960
and so the question of course for next

3179
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,400
steps is is the regular one

3180
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,239
this requires work it's just the first

3181
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,480
version okay but the question is okay

3182
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,239
should we collaborate with the draft on

3183
01:54:50,239 --> 01:54:52,159
use cases and what i try to alert to on

3184
01:54:52,159 --> 01:54:53,440
the mailing list is that

3185
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,159
sure but we would like as far as

3186
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,400
possible okay if everybody agrees

3187
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,320
to keep a more objective structure than

3188
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,320
just debating on the cases we have

3189
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:05,840
and actually build create kpis and and

3190
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,159
with with specific sources

3191
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:11,280
and again alert that we are focused on

3192
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,520
on services not use cases of course this

3193
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,040
can be merged because the use case has a

3194
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,719
bunch of services inside

3195
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:19,360
but so adding a condensed version i

3196
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:21,199
quite frankly don't know how that fits

3197
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:21,920
okay

3198
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:24,800
um from the three authors we discussed

3199
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,400
when we started this work just to say

3200
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:28,159
that this actually i've been in contact

3201
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:28,960
with if

3202
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,480
it got delight because i've covered

3203
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,719
another stuff so this is not for now

3204
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:33,920
it's a document that we have been

3205
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,239
creating over the last year

3206
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:39,440
and um so um

3207
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,520
we did take a look into the use cases

3208
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,639
document okay

3209
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:44,560
and we decided to go ahead with an

3210
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:46,320
individual draft

3211
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,080
because we felt there was something

3212
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,400
missing okay i actually i think i raised

3213
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,400
this discussion also a bunch of miles

3214
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,080
ago okay and despite the fact that i'm

3215
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:54,719
not

3216
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:58,080
active in raw i'm listening so

3217
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,840
there are the reasons for for in terms

3218
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:02,560
of time so but in other words i'm open

3219
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,800
and and of course this this has to go to

3220
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:05,760
discussion

3221
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,280
and uh to merge the document but

3222
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,679
so our our idea was okay this is on the

3223
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,679
charter rick today said

3224
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:16,560
okay the charter charter is being uh

3225
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:17,520
defined

3226
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,880
redefined but it is our belief that we

3227
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,239
need a document like this in the

3228
01:56:22,239 --> 01:56:25,440
community and in raw thank you

3229
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:28,080
thank you ruta i think this is a very

3230
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:28,639
useful

3231
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:30,480
and a very in-depth analysis i think

3232
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,800
it's really helpful so thank you

3233
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,840
um as i said to carlos the

3234
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,040
the how we tie this with the use cases

3235
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,040
is very much open for debate i agree

3236
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:42,670
with both of you

3237
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:44,239
[Music]

3238
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:45,920
i don't want to lose this detail and

3239
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,239
adding it all to use cases may unbalance

3240
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,159
the use cases document

3241
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:53,040
um having it as a separate document i

3242
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:53,599
think is

3243
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:55,360
incredibly useful but we need to be able

3244
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,119
to draw the two together in some way in

3245
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:58,400
cross-reference

3246
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,320
uh definitely a discussion for the

3247
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:01,440
mailing list

3248
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:04,880
but yes i personally not with my chair

3249
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,239
hat on i personally think this is a

3250
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:08,159
great document and we need to

3251
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:11,360
adopt it and make it work for us

3252
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:13,920
in terms of our grand scheme for how

3253
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:15,440
we're trying to make our documents make

3254
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:16,159
sense

3255
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:18,560
for as for as everyone keeps saying for

3256
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,320
the for the fresh reader who comes along

3257
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,000
in five years time

3258
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,520
these things have got to be accessible

3259
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:24,960
and work out how to do it but thank you

3260
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:26,560
very much to you and your team that was

3261
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:27,440
really good thank you

3262
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,040
yes and thank you for the detail i

3263
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,880
wholeheartedly agree

3264
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,719
um that this level of detail is

3265
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:35,119
immensely helpful

3266
01:57:35,119 --> 01:57:39,519
i mean go ahead after sodom

3267
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:46,960
i i i i agree also that

3268
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:53,840
we need without requirement

3269
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,119
already but at least we discussed this

3270
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:00,239
so we can

3271
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:01,840
think in the future how about the

3272
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,840
technologies and

3273
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:06,080
the documents already uh the technology

3274
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,880
document

3275
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:11,199
and uh regarding the dealer and

3276
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:14,400
make the make documents maybe

3277
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,960
after we we decide to adapt the

3278
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,080
requirement document

3279
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:19,679
and this document or the use case

3280
01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:22,080
document and this one we can then think

3281
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:22,960
about uh

3282
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,560
other technologies or uh the nick and uh

3283
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,199
dealer and actually uh i will add also

3284
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:30,080
that uh

3285
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:32,960
dlip in my opinion is uh is one of the

3286
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,239
technologies uh

3287
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:38,000
uh regard needed by uh uh

3288
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,040
uh uh uh networks

3289
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:44,880
and uh uh so it can be included some

3290
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,000
information

3291
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,880
uh in the uh technology document

3292
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,119
regarding dlip how it's used or how it

3293
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:52,080
can be used

3294
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,000
with other technologies or something

3295
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,199
like that and

3296
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:58,159
uh also uh

3297
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,239
i will not forget that uh i thank stan

3298
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:04,960
for the deal he was the first part of

3299
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,599
this and

3300
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:07,760
we forget because we have been passed

3301
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:08,639
away you know

3302
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:11,040
so we will never forget you he's done a

3303
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:11,679
very

3304
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:15,119
very perfect job on this document and i

3305
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:16,480
have uh commented on

3306
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,880
it and he was very nice there and i

3307
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:20,320
think also rick

3308
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,400
knows and he or he's one of the

3309
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:24,639
important authors also

3310
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:27,360
so dealer in my opinion it will help a

3311
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:28,960
lot in our this

3312
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:32,159
working group so i hope also that rick

3313
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:32,960
will

3314
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,440
do some you know a draft or something

3315
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,440
like extension for this uh

3316
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,920
working group because it's uh different

3317
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:40,560
from uh

3318
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:45,840
man i'm one of the best participants

3319
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,599
it's a different use case it's a

3320
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:51,280
different environment uh just just to

3321
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:52,960
note uh thank you abdusanam

3322
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,679
just to note the use cases document is a

3323
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,760
working group document

3324
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:00,880
so we have already adopted that so

3325
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:03,040
i i want to um thank everybody for their

3326

and i also want to thank um whoever it

3328
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:08,480

3329
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:11,679
whose names are on our list oh i've been

3330
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:12,960
