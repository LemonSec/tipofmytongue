cory hang on

28

looking at the jabber shot i think

29
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
miteko might have some small issue

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,640
because it seemed it dumped

31
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
quite a lot of users

32
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,480
and that's

33
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,599
yeah it looks like my show okay no no

34
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040

it's just wonderful it's very easy to to

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,120

left

42
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,280
left meta shift click just to figure out

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
how to get out of it

44
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,519

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,079

48
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
toggle back and forth between windows

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,840

pasting the agenda

68
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,280

well with

70
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,320

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,360
remo we don't need the blow by blowers i

72
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,560
suspect most people don't

73
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,039
read read the minutes for blow by blow

74
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,840
we do need to record

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,880
uh any any any major decisions

76
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,479
uh that get read

77
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,759
okay um

78
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,919
need some people to watch jabber um

79
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,759
all you need to do is if is if you've

80
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,240
got your your eyes on jabber and you see

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,039
something turn

82
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
up in chat raise your hand and with luck

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,199
one of us will notice

84
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,919
and we'll get somebody on uh we'll get

85
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:24,639
you over

86
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,479
or we're making the comment in jabber

87
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,000
onto the mic

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,280
um as usual we always need reviewers for

89
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
our working of drafts and a reminder

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,800
folks please

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,120
uh do add um

92
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,520
tsvwg to the uh name of any internet

93
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,560
draft submitted

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
that way we might actually notice them

95
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
okay some meet echo usage tips um

96
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
both the chat and the meeting notes can

97
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,360
be separated

98
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
into separate windows or tabs it's

99
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,720
actually quite useful because it means

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
um that you can toggle back and forth

101
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,319
between windows on your screen to change

102
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,919
context as opposed to

103
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
having to find the right icon in meet uh

104
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,160
in meet echo and it leaves you meet echo

105
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,960
window focus

106
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,520
on speakers cues and slides we just had

107
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
discussion about this

108
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
um the icons have changed in fact

109
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,800
this is hand uh

110
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,160
hand icon mic on please don't use

111
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
um the mic uh icon

112
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,960
until acknowledged by the chairs you

113
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
just saw uh a demonstration of this and

114
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120

this

150
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,160
within

156
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,399
in the past 24 hours it's funny how

157
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,680
meeting week uh

158
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
cause uh is a forcing function for stuff

159
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
to happen anyhow

160
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080

last call and again the meeting week is

164
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,720
functioned as

165
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
as a forcing function in that new

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
draftsman posted with

167
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080

168
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,839
text um

169

um but the basic outline is

248
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
dr collins accomplishments and status

249
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,600
today which we're in the middle of now

250
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
milestones review coming up shortly

251
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,240
drafts wednesday agenda more drafts and

252
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,200
in particular

253
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,720
uh the game plan is that uh wednesday is

254
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,600
pretty much

255
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
devoted to the l4 s work

256
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
on which we are endeavoring in

257
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
endeavoring to make uh

258
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
make progress and so that that's what

259
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
the entire wednesday agenda is going to

260
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,760
be devoted to

261
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,440
also notice that this agenda is

262
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
completely full it looks like we may

263
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
want to ask for four hours next time

264
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
three is no longer three appears no

265
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
longer enough

266
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,200
okay milestone milestones review and i'm

267
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,279
going to try and take notes we go along

268
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,880
we had this optimistic notion that we'd

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,560
be able to publish the l4s uh

270
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,920
architecture uh draft uh

271
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,480
before the the two main protocol drafts

272
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,360
not happening

273
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,560
um so el forest architecture needs to

274
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,040
move

275
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,480
to uh october 2021.

276
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,600
um the next two milestones

277
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,639
are for our two uh each and cap drafts

278
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,040
have been

279
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
hanging around for a while um i just

280
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,680
promised that those will be done by the

281
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,959
next ietf

282
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,279
uh so those two milestones change to

283
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,720
june of 2021

284
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,360
sctp michael

285
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
if you're on please turn your mic on and

286
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,880

287
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,240
what a reasonable time frame uh

288
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,360
uh for uh sctp might be go

289
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,680
go ahead

290
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,720
so what i mean we can just from my

291
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
perspective it's ready for working group

292
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,720
last call

293
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
all right david i've done a review of

294
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:14,959
this

295
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,880
and i concur with michael that we should

296
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
ask the working group

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,839
if we can find reviewers for a last call

298
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,440
this meeting

299
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,000
okay we'll we'll go look for glasgow

300

301
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,320
and i will put september 2020

302
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,240
21 on that as a new date um

303
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
that way we've got uh if things happen

304
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
and summer and

305
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
and and summer occurs um we've still got

306
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,760
got a got a plausible milestone it would

307
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,279
be lovely if we could get this done

308
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,040
between now and next ietf

309
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,279
but uh i've been through the we're gonna

310
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,399
get everything on my next meeting and

311
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,519
then discovering that

312
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,600
uh a third to two-thirds of the things

313
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,959
in the next meeting bucket don't

314
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,800
donate um all right

315
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,399
transfer options for udp

316
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,360
this one's been running slowly i don't

317
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:03,680
know

318
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,320
genu uh push it push it glory what do

319
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
you think a time frame for this one

320
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
might be

321
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,160
well it depends after this meeting and

322
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
joe's going to present very quickly

323
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
the changes and there looks like little

324
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,079
needing to be done so we're looking for

325
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,160
reviewers here to understand whether we

326
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
can working group let's call that so

327
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
that could be quite soon as well

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680

viewers attention to it i think i'm

333
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,079
going to apply the same algorithm to nqb

334

that we just applied to uh sctp

335

the draft itself is in good shape and

342
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,079

343
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
later today on that um and only one kind

344
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,160

346
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,040

of

369
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,000
liaison the statements that i need to

370
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
briefly call attention to the chairs i

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
have to respond to

372
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,160
uh we'll go immediately sc uh sctp

373
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,199
drafts

374
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,640
uh then joe touch uh for udp

375
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,119
options the nqb draft we just talked

376
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,079
about

377
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,280
and uh anna kastura has one

378
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,640
once once again uh folks in gory's uh

379
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,000
group at uh uh have gone gone and

380
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,360
measured internet again

381
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
and we have some interesting interesting

382
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,360
um implications

383
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,679
uh for measurements of use of dscp2

384
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,360
which is one of the key proposed uh

385
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,720
dscps for nqb then the rest of today is

386
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,400
a couple of individual drafts q log

387
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,720
um has been proposed i think initially

388
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
the queue i think it may have

389
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,840
initially stood for quick it no doubt

390
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
stands for something else now

391
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,400
it's looking like a general logging

392
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,200
mechanism

393
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,960
we want to get some air time here to see

394
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,320
what people think of it

395
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,880
and then we have uh some measurements of

396
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,840
ecn

397
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,360
uh act on an exchange provider um

398
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,160
that uh will talk through through this

399
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,960
representing map

400
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,120
rg we'll talk to some implications here

401
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,760
this is in some ways a setup for

402
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,880
for wednesday which is l for which is l

403
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,000
for s day

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,559
um you'll see uh i'm gonna start the

405
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,400
author's operational guidance draft

406
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,559
which we're going to adoption requested

407
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,000
um we

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,799
then have the three main uh alfres

409
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,679
drafts

410
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,799
and ingrimar if we have time ingomar

411
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,919
uh will have the uh opportunity to talk

412
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,120
about some of the work

413
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,799
uh doing of racing 5g

414
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,240
gory go ahead um i just wanted to note

415
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,960
that we had

416
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
more requests for time than we could

417
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,039
accommodate this time

418
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,080
so um if you're going to make a request

419
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,799
for time

420
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,120
at an agenda in a coming meeting please

421
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,559
do it ahead of the time

422
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,640
so we can get a feel as to how much time

423
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,799
we need and how to allocate it

424
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,280
yeah my initial take is we need to ask

425
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,120
for four hours next time and that we

426
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,760
we could easily have used another hour

427
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,880
that we don't have

428
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,360
for a number of drafts that would like

429
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,000
to

430
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
like like some air time and it would be

431
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
good to give some of these drafts

432
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,480
airtime but we just

433
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,840
we just don't have the time

434
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,000
okay anybody want to

435
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,840
bash or martin go ahead

436
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,480
uh pass i was just gonna remind you to

437
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,799
do this

438
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
do you remind me to do what ask for four

439
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,760
hours next time

440
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,799
no uh that's the agenda okay so now we

441
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,400
need to bash the agenda

442
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,880
and marcus i know you want to bash the

443
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,440
agenda

444
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,240
yeah hi michael speaking author of the

445
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,360
multi-force dsp

446
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,760
draft somehow we had an issue in in our

447
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,799
conversation

448
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,880
um because i intended to request this

449
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
time adoption but unfortunately i

450
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,280
haven't got a

451
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,440
slot and my question is do we have

452
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,320
somehow five

453
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,960
minutes to discuss adoption this time

454
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,320
let me go

455
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
let's let's let's try to do that fairly

456
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,360
quickly i believe you sent me one slide

457
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,039
let me see if i can fish it out of the

458
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,919
chaos as masquerading as my email inbox

459
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,400
yeah there it is let's put that one

460
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,360
slide up

461
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,400
i think the right thing to do is going

462
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,440
to be to

463
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,799
handle the adoption call on the list

464
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,000
all right now i've got the slide up

465
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,200
now i gotta figure out how to do

466
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
stop screen share share screen

467
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,320
hang on um

468
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:02,080
yeah that one

469
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,280
and if i've done this right your one

470
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,399
slide is showing up

471
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
so you want to say a few things about

472
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,039
this slide mark sure i can do

473
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,200
so maybe some of you have seen that we

474
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,880
make some significant

475
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,679
uh progress on the multi-pass dcp so we

476
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,840
updated the draft

477
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,960
what we exactly did you find in the uh

478
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,000
on the tsv wg mailing list so there's a

479
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
link

480
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,960
which guides to this email

481
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,679
we have a new contributor to the draft

482
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,559
it's british telecom

483
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,120
and i think most important this time we

484
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,799
have published the multi-past thesis app

485
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,000
open source so

486
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,799
you can get all the informations how to

487
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,720
access the code

488
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,520
how to use it how to maybe set up own

489
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
test that you find on the multiple

490
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,159
ccp.org

491
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,640
then we have also seen that uh some

492
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,440
parties

493
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400
um expressed their interest in multiples

494
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,280
tccp

495
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
it was casa systems like telefonica and

496
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,559
so on i can't remember

497
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,400
all of them um yeah that's why my plan

498
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
this time is to to request adoption and

499
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,720
happy to discuss this

500
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,039
now with you okay okay

501
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,159
go ahead yeah can i i'm i'm

502
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,679
pretty sure as we've been through this

503
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,200
before that if we're

504
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,159
the ietf is to do work on dccp this is

505
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,760
the right working group

506
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,799
so i think you're in the right place and

507
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,440
dccp isn't a protocol we've seen a lot

508
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,080
of

509
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,159
active development and implementation

510
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,280
activities around

511
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,880
recently so we would be

512
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,120
very interested in people who would like

513
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,240
to implement

514
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,559
this and see a need for an interoperable

515
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,679
standard

516
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,960
so if you're in the area of implementing

517
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,440
this

518
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,679
if you plan to implement it if you plan

519
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,480
to use

520
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,960
a standard if it's produced then these

521
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,480
are the things to speak up with on the

522
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,919
list that will help us

523
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,919
frame this question about adoption

524
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,559
so gary is sorry for for asking again

525
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,039
because

526
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,880
my impression was all right that was

527
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,559
also what we discussed last time last

528
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,440
itf

529
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,240
and my feeling was now with publishing

530
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,799
uh

531
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,120
the multiplex tccp open source as part

532
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,080
of the linux network

533
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,120
stack also uh multiple parties who

534
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,960
expressed already the interest on the

535
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
waiting list that this

536
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,240
is or should be enough to request the

537
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,520
adoption

538
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,880
am i wrong here um it's enough to start

539
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,799
asking the question about adoption

540
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,480
and there'll be more questions to follow

541
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,000
these are encouraging answers

542
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,720
i like the answers i'm hearing uh we

543
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,559
will have to discuss this on the list

544
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,159
the other thing is when you say part of

545
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,600
the linux stack is this

546
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,080
core as in is this a part of the

547
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,919
mainstream release that you're planning

548
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,360
or is it no

549
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,400
it's a tree it's a private sheet right

550
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,880
okay so

551
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,320
it's good for experiments it's good for

552
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,640
finding out about interest it's good for

553
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,200
doing doing work with so that's good

554
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,880
um this is something we obviously have

555
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
to talk with

556
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,200
with you and we can also talk about

557
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,679
this in a separate catch-up meeting with

558
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,480
you

559
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,799
but please use the list to discuss this

560
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,520
okay yeah thank you

561
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,039
jonathan are you in queue for the same

562
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,360
topic

563
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,120
um just a tiny agenda bashing thing that

564
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
i'll be talking about uh pete heist's

565
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,480
draft

566
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,080
is a defeat fair enough

567
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,000
fair enough and uh and as i noted in the

568
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,799
in the chat with you previously um just

569
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,679
prior to this

570
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,840
meeting when pete got cut from his

571
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,240
questions in map rg there simply wasn't

572
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,080
time to really ask questions or go into

573
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,039
the data

574
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,919
so we'd like to open with questions

575
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,360
around the data sets that have been

576
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
produced and

577
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
and see how that goes i i think it would

578
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,720
be useful to be able to talk about that

579
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,919
data it's useful data

580
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,320
well we're going to feel good with that

581
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,840
okay sounds good all right

582
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
what are we on to other new drafts or

583
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,919
liaison statement first

584
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,640

is we are back to here

using dtls with

608
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,640
larger messages and

609
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,559
this relates to the http draft that

610
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,559
magnus will present so i guess we will

611
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,559
hear more in magnus's talk later

612

in this meeting which is in 4.2

613
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,559

614
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,279
announcements

615
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,400

one

666
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,080
uh the old eight version is about the

667
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,520
transition from xml v2 to v3 so if you

668
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,279
compare both you have lots of white

669
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,960
space changes

670
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,960
um and the appendix a which was about

671
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,600

674
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,240

675
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,080
addressed in the version 08

676
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,240

basically three reviews um

678
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,240
and um if you go to the next slide

679
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,679
um one quick question um as you go

680
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:22,880
through accepted

681
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
well path mtu is a really common

682
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,240
concept i had three really drafts on

683
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,679
there um

684
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,919
do we have someone in the working group

685
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:32,880
who's trying to

686
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,760
to write her to all the on all the

687
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
various drafts

688
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,039
that are working on path mtu

689
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,080
um i would say how i use this

690
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,960
and what the comments are so like so the

691
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,360
the

692
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,960
the document um so i got lots of

693
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
editorial comments but this one was

694
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,480
i would say not not only editorial so

695
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,880
um in a lot of places in the documents

696
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240
um

697
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,679
um something about the size of the

698
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,120
packet or something like this was

699
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,760
mentioned

700
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,880
and it was vague intentionally vague

701
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
and this doesn't seem to be appropriate

702
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,919
anymore so

703
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,039
um there are two contacts

704
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,720
one is a size argument related to the

705
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,240
size of the packet

706
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,799
um like does it fit does it need to be

707
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,679
fragmented and so on and so i changed

708
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,640
um the usage there to pmtu which means

709
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,360
the

710
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,480
maximum size of an sctp packet on

711
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,799
a particular path and the size of the

712
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,000
http pack is

713
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,960
the size of the ip payload um so that's

714
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,919
pmtu

715
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,120
that's consistently used there as pmtu

716
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,000
and um the size was also used in the

717
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,159
context of receive window congestion

718
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,320
window where you increase and

719
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,840
and reduce our numbers and there we

720
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,039
use now pmdcs which is the path maximum

721
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,640
data chunk size

722
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,919
and if you are within the context of

723
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,960
of this document it's just uh the pmtu

724
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
minus the size of the

725
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,120
the common header minus uh if you're not

726
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,480
a multiple of four

727
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,840
um if you have auth sap authentication

728
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
then you have to

729
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,799
also subtract the size of the

730
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,559
authentication header

731
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,080
but so this is now handled more

732
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,360
precisely

733
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,760
um if you want to change the names i

734
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,519
don't care to change the names

735
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,559
um some of the suggestions which haven't

736
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,559
been accepted was uh

737
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,039
split fast retransmission there was a

738
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,799
suggestion to include this but this is

739
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
used for multipath transport

740
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,840
and multipath http is not something the

741
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,320
working

742
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,679
wants to work on so um i

743
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,200
didn't accept that um the other one was

744
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,240
uh that the association fails eventually

745
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,360
if the peer does stop reading date user

746
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:55,919
data

747
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,399
and this is not how transports work so

748
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,360
if they

749
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,279
if the connection stays alive in the

750
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,200
sense of you can reach your peer

751
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,960
the peer just is not reading anymore

752
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
that's an application layer problem but

753
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,799
not a transport layer problem

754
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,600
uh the next one was that um out of the

755
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,840
blue packets should only be so a packet

756
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,760
should only be out of the blue

757
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,440
if it's um um if it's uh

758
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,760
if it's for a particular endpoint so if

759
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,480
a host

760
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,440
running a kernel stack um gets a packet

761
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,519
and there is no open port for it it

762
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,120
shouldn't be considered out of the blue

763
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,159
so this

764
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,159
in my sense not what out of the blue

765
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,600
means um

766
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,360
there was a suggestion to change that

767
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,679
receiver may send it about in response

768
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,360
to an out of the blue

769
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,399
packet currently the text says should

770
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,440
and um this is a protection mechanism

771
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,559
for

772
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,039
for nodes not running http and it should

773
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,159
stay there

774
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,200
and the last one was to provide a

775
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,120
parameter set which is more appropriate

776
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,960
for signaling networks but

777
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,880
we have been through this discussion i

778
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,360
think in 1999 or 2000

779
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,679
um where the ietf does things for the

780
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,360
internet and not for signaling networks

781
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,840
so

782
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,159
uh the parameter sets are for signal uh

783
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,440
for for the internet

784
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,399
not for signaling networks um i listed

785
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,279
the people who

786
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,240
provided feedback thank you very much um

787
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,640
i

788
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,600
pinged three additional person people i

789
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,159
haven't got

790
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,440
feedback from but i picked them again so

791
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,679
from my perspective if you go to the

792
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,880
next slide

793
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,320
um the documents

794
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,440
to me screen too many windows yeah

795
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,480
next time there we go yeah so uh

796
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,960
i i got one comment from magnus that he

797
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,080
wants a

798
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,159
definition of control chunk which is now

799
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,760
in for the next version

800
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,720
but um except for addressing new

801
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,679
comments

802
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,120
there's nothing on it to do with so

803
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,799
please read it or stop the writing

804
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,080
okay corey wants to say something so

805
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,159
gory go ahead and then we need to figure

806
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,760
out what to do here

807
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,360
okay um michael are you familiar with

808
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,918
the implementations are they following

809
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,440
this this update is this new stuff to

810
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,199
them or is this stuff that's already

811
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,079
done and needs to be documented i'm not

812
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,159
familiar with the solaris implementation

813
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,239
but linux and previously should be more

814
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,638
or less

815
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,359
should be more or less compliant

816
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,960
excellent if people want to comment on

817
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,760
that on the list that's fine

818
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,800
okay um so let's let's

819
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,359
let's try something innovative here we

820
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,199
need some working group last call

821
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,320
reviewers

822
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,560
if you're willing to review and comment

823
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,399
on this virtual ass call assume working

824
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,560
glass call happens uh either later this

825
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:48,960
month

826
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,599
or in april please click on the raise

827
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,399
your hand

828
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,679
join q icon

829
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
and to clarify david if you've already

830
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,839
reviewed and will be happy to confirm

831
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,359
your reviews please also click

832
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,640
i see magnus and gory okay and

833
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,200
we may round ups try to round up some

834
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
other reviewers some of the folks who

835
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,680
provided comments

836
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,920
michael has reached out for comments on

837
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,440
the important thing is we do need to

838
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,079
have

839
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,200
a number of people read the draft at

840
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
uh what new glass call and a fresh pair

841
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
of eyes would almost certainly help as

842
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,400
michael's working on this

843
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
uh for quite some time suspect he knows

844
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,759
a lot of the text by heart

845
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,839
yeah i guess timo will reread it

846
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,800
i can place an extra caveat if we don't

847
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
get people to review it then of course

848
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
the working group last call walk

849
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,800
complete

850
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
there's my little threat but i don't see

851
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
the reason

852
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,680
avoiding having a working group last

853
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,119
call after people have already given

854
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,640
review comments

855
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,040
yeah and i think the thing to do will be

856
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,560
we and i think that means gory

857
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,240
principally will work with michael to

858
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
make sure we round up some committed

859
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
uh last call some committed last call

860
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,359
reviewers so we so

861
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,680
we we we get uh sufficient reviews

862
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,280
when will you have your revision ready

863
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,000
michael for progressing this

864
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,240
well online is submitted so that's ready

865
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,640
and for this control chunk stuff it's

866
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,200
it's a one sentence i mean i can submit

867
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,560
it if you want

868
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,880
and then so it's ready yeah

869
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,880
go ahead and make all the changes

870
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,400
michael and we'll try and then progress

871
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,440
it

872
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,160
okay so that so dash chance coming is

873
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,760
coming soon and that's the version you

874
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,079
want

875
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,440
that that's ready for working with last

876
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,359
call

877
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,160
so version 10 has one sentence more than

878
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,040
version nine i can submit it today

879
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,119
okay excellent and and that is the very

880
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,720
mischief that is is that the version

881
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,119
that

882
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,560
that that ought to be sent to a group

883
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,160
last call in your opinion

884
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,599
yes okay cool

885
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,400
all right what can i ask for another

886
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,079
comment from michael while he's still

887
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,200
here

888
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,560
michael could you comment on sctp not

889
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,760
it's received some ad review and i

890
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,320
believe this

891
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,400
conversation about progressing it do you

892
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,160
want to give in one sentence

893
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,440
a current status or

894
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,680
something like this either way yeah

895
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,200
maybe i can start

896
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,839
so provide the context there because

897
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,520
actually working group hasn't seen this

898
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,359
uh i did a review just

899
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,359
finished friday i'm sorry for the very

900
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,200
long delay here uh

901
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,640
and my plan here is now after getting

902
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,040
some response i will update my ad review

903
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,359
based on some feedback from michael and

904
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,160
publish

905
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
and submit that publicly so everyone can

906
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,520
see it

907
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,240
i talked to um martin about doing that

908
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,720
too

909
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,560
so that's my plan going forward so

910
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
everyone can see my feedback here

911
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
and then we can have a public discussion

912
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,880
i think on the main list about

913
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,560
dealing with some of these issues etc

914
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,400
but uh

915
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,000
and and and target but yeah

916
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,160
yeah maybe maybe one thing i

917
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,520
would say is that the nut document is

918
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,880
very old it started i think

919
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,240
15 years ago um with the main

920
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,760
um use case uh clients behind a

921
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,560
consumer nut and talking to public web

922
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,599
servers

923
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,960
public servers um and magnus brought up

924
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,320
a use case

925
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,119
in which is with the virtualization

926
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,800
stuff where you have

927
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,280
multi-homing is more important and so we

928
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,000
we didn't

929
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,880
focus on that use case basically so

930
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,839
that's

931
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,760
something we might need to look at

932
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,720
or not okay martin and then we have to

933
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,320
go back to magnus because you've got the

934
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,560
slides the next session martin go ahead

935
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,640
yeah i just want to briefly say that uh

936
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,240
obviously the clock is going to run

937
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,280
out on on um magnus's

938
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,800
uh uh a.d time and so unfortunately

939
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,920
well i'm gonna have to read this thing

940
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
and unfortunately you're essentially

941
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
gonna get a double id review

942
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
and i apologize for the to the authors

943
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,560
for that um but that's how it's getting

944
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,520
working out i'm gonna

945
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,599
with reviews

950
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,680
the document has been proved vastly over

951
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,440
the time it's existed

952
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,680
and please pay attention on the list to

953
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,520
what's going on so you can contribute

954
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,200

960
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,800
bingo level i see yeah i'll try to get

full screen so yes

963
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,960
uh this is dtls over http uh

964
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,839
enough proposed update to rfc 6083

965
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:42,079
draft is uh titles there uh

966
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,400
it's been worked on by me and my

967
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,200
co-authors

968
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,839
uh claudio polly ferry from ericsson

969
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,040
john matson and

970
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,640
michael jackson from university

971
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,000
flight science so uh so

972
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,079
the background for this update our

973
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,079
proposal update is that

974
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,760
3dpp in the

975
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,760
in 5g networks uses the lsrtp

976
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,560
in other words rc 683 for securing

977
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,480
several radio network application

978
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,920
protocols

979
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,520
and it's it's load update

980
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,839
okay uh

981
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,279
why isn't it updating

982
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:35,839
has people seen update seen me flipping

983
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,359
let me try magnus

984
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,599
magnus your slides are not in

985
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,079
presentation mode at least what i see

986
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,720
no and i was i went into let's see if it

987
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,480
works better if ah

988
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,599
it seems to doesn't pick up updated yeah

989
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,119
i will do it from this

990
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,040
if you let me just i can do it like

991
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,279
this

992
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,920
so um yes so in gdp

993
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,359
there's at least four different uh

994
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,040
radio network interface related

995
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,960
protocols that uses

996
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,160
that has the theoretical potential to

997
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,119
send

998
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,800
messages over 16k which is the limit

999
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,599
to rfc 6083 for user message sizes

1000
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,920
this hasn't been to my knowledge any

1001
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,800
real message

1002
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,440
yet but as discussion evolution goes

1003
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,680
forward in 3dpp

1004
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,839
this was realized as they started

1005
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,680
discussing larger

1006
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,160
sets etc in some cases so they need to

1007
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,240
deal with this

1008
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,839
and 3dpp

1009
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,359
asking tsbw to address the issues

1010
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,960
there's an action in that

1011
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,520
to respond if we can deal with it etc uh

1012
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,480
so that's gonna need

1013
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,000
a response in some form 3dpp and

1014
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,760
basically people would really prefer

1015
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
this a general solution to address this

1016
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,480
issue

1017
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,240
than having to try to address it in

1018
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,079
their individual protocols for each and

1019
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,359
every

1020
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,480
of them so um and that's why

1021
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,480
they want us to look into if you can

1022
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,720
update

1023
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,760
rc63 and it really is the issue here is

1024
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,560
that

1025
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,119
683 maps produce a message to a single

1026
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,520
detailers record

1027
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
which then becomes too small because

1028
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,599
it's only 16k

1029
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,599
uh we also have the issues of rfc 6083

1030
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,359
security requirements i mean this rfc is

1031
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,240
i think 10 years old and it shows its

1032
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,720
detail is 1.0

1033
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,160
and it's sha one in stp oauth not that

1034
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,480
it's

1035
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,200
super sense problematic for a moment but

1036
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
at least it's it's a little bit low

1037
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,839
uh on security properties so

1038
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,800
so the proposal here really is to

1039
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
replace our c63 with updated

1040
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,839
specification

1041
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,240
define a secure fragmentation mechanism

1042
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,000
and basically it's a very simple

1043
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,319
diff message so looking at the right

1044
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,119
side of screen

1045
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,599
we have the uh plain text user message

1046
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,200
then use fragment that into

1047
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,720
units that fits in a detailer's records

1048
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,480
as many as you need then you run on each

1049
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,000
fragment

1050
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
you protect that with it to create the

1051
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,079
details record and then you concatenate

1052
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,319
together as a protected user message

1053
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,520
then you transmit it over http

1054
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
on a particular stream as an individual

1055
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,119
user message

1056
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,440
and you basically rely on the sctp

1057
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,119
authentication to ensure that the

1058
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,480
fragments

1059
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,440
arrive at the receiver in the correct

1060
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,800
order and that no one can

1061
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,040
interfere with it as these aspects of

1062
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,520
the data being

1063
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,359
so you have the stp authentication as a

1064
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,480
protection for the order of the

1065
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,440
fragments and then

1066
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,880
each details record is individually

1067
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,040
encrypted and integrity protected

1068
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,680
no i should go back sorry

1069
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,560
we also have the security requirements

1070
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,839
fixing that

1071
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,599
we also looked into some signaling of

1072
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,680
supported message sizes from the

1073
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,960
by the end point uh and

1074
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,359
this is now also defined as a sctp

1075
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,880
adaptation layer

1076
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,960
and with a handshake indication and it

1077
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,160
allows us to do

1078
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,599
something which uh

1079
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,520
avoid some of the uncertainty so when

1080
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,960
you're doing this in the handshake you

1081
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,160
already know that you're gonna run

1082
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,960
details

1083
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,880
on all the messages so you have no

1084
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,000
question or not if

1085
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,680
this should be protected or not um

1086
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,400
you also do like some housekeeping or

1087
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,160
saying oh eye data for this

1088
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
large message is really useful because

1089
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,680
otherwise you're gonna run

1090
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,079
potentially into some bottlenecks and

1091
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,839
we're also trying to clarify some of the

1092
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:05,280
details 1.2 renegotiation

1093
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,440
so that's the kind of what we're trying

1094
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,880
to accomplish here with the updated

1095
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,359
proposal

1096
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,680
then we have as i said this is still

1097
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,839
relying on sctp authentication you can't

1098
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,240
use this without it it's

1099
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,280
sap authentication is keyed by the dtls

1100
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,079
and the details fragmentation mechanism

1101
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:24,640
and

1102
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,599
re replay protection of details records

1103
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,560
is provided by the ssp stack and

1104
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,760
authentication so it's nothing no data

1105
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,680
should ever be duplicated up to words

1106
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,440
about the http layer if

1107
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,599
if any attacker tries to duplicate data

1108
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,200
it should be caught and handled by the

1109
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,640
stack

1110
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,799
so

1111
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,319
uh however we do have some open issues

1112
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,280
and some work for

1113
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,599
front of us still to before this is

1114
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,720
ready

1115
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,640
one of the issues we actually realized

1116
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,480
is that detail is 1.3

1117
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,599
and re-keying for long-lived flows is

1118
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,040
problematic and the basic here is that

1119
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,400
details 1.3 do not support renegotiation

1120
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,440
so there's no post handshake

1121
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,040
server authentication it

1122
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,280
re-authenticates client

1123
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,599
it doesn't run re-run the helmet or

1124
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,839
export their secret updates

1125
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,480
so it can re-key in a certain way but

1126
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,040
it's

1127
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,000
has a mechanism that's not ideal for

1128
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,480
having

1129
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,000
long lived sessions and when i talk

1130
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,359
about long lead sessions say we're

1131
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,079
talking

1132
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,720
days weeks months for some of these

1133
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,319
usages for example in mobile networks

1134
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,720
so it's not really practical to tear

1135
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,000
down and it's also not

1136
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,680
particularly practical to tear down and

1137
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,119
re-establish because

1138
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,079
that means that you have to bring maybe

1139
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,440
whole cell sites

1140
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,680
down etc for doing that so uh it's

1141
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,520
really not something we want to do

1142
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,280
so we had started some discussion in the

1143
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,680
tls working group about these things for

1144
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,760
the telus 1.3 so

1145
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,520
i'll have to see where this is taking us

1146
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,040
but at least there's an issue which i'm

1147
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,319
going and therefore

1148
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,880
dtls 1.2 support will be crucial

1149
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,240
initially

1150
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,160
for ensuring that property for long lead

1151
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,920
flows

1152
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,119
uh and we also

1153
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,359
this adaptation layer and being certain

1154
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,720
that everything is protected by

1155
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,599
detailers

1156
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,240
is good but i want to point out that

1157
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,440
start tls will

1158
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,680
not work under these restrictions and

1159
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,440
and therefore it's a question more than

1160
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,319
anything to

1161
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,880
see if anyone has issues with us taking

1162
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,040
this direction

1163
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,319
um and

1164
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,559
we also want this clarify a bit about

1165
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,240
the portrait delivery

1166
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,559
or protect user message between the sctp

1167
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,319
stack and the upper layer of detail is

1168
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,440
here

1169
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,119
and what happens when you actually don't

1170
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,520
get all the data and what you do

1171
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,400
uh we also see in these socket api

1172
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,200
changes

1173
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,200
maybe have some need for that because if

1174
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,880
you're require testing

1175
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,319
for example that you should use sha-256

1176
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,640
the current socket api for uh sdb auth

1177
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,960
it's not clear on which uh handling this

1178
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,079
like

1179
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,599
uh on the on the algorithm side and set

1180
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,040
and put the requirements on those things

1181
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,720
so we're gonna see something there

1182
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,919
we need to deal with so

1183
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,599
so but the main thing here is that we

1184
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,160
actually

1185
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,839
want to request a working group adoption

1186
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:21,440
of this uh

1187
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,319
as we see it it's it's 1683 do you need

1188
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,040
an update

1189
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,920
uh to resolve this length restriction

1190
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,400
it's

1191
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,760
a good time to actually update the

1192
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
security algorithm requirements

1193
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,240
and we do have a time frame from 3dpp in

1194
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,000
some sense because

1195
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,160
they want to fix this i think in the in

1196
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,760
in the current release which is

1197
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,200
by march 2022 it's this stage free so we

1198
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,640
need to have something ready that

1199
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,440
by then basically and we think we can do

1200
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,079
that we have a year

1201
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,319
and so discussion

1202
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,400
we're gonna start sending out some of

1203
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,319
the open issues on the mailing list

1204
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,040
we have some more editorials etc to work

1205
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,359
on

1206
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,000
and we do have using github for this if

1207
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,960
you have source

1208
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,599
you can submit all requests or file

1209
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:08,240
issues

1210
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,839
on this link so corey

1211
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,640
i i i can see the um

1212
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,359
suggested need for this i wondered

1213
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:22,800
whether anybody else in the working

1214
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,640
group had any comments on the

1215
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,680
what you've presented or had interest

1216
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,280
in this topic is there anybody

1217
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,160
interested in the topic that magnus has

1218
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,960
presented

1219
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,800
or thinks they would have expertise to

1220
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,839
work on this

1221
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,680
i knew i knew yeah go ahead

1222
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,839
i'm interested in this extension

1223
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,119
i'm interested in the work

1224
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:07,280
okay well and this is this is david i

1225
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,319
think i'm interested

1226
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,240
enough to find the time to read the

1227
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,319
draft magnus let me quickly understand

1228
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,119
something

1229
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,200
um this draft is the

1230
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,040
is the anticipated response to the 3gpp

1231
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,520
liaison statement that is supposedly

1232
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,440
inbound is that correct

1233
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,079
it's not supposedly it has arrived so

1234
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:28,559
it's

1235
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,920
it's refined but yes so

1236
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,280
uh it showed up on friday all right have

1237
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,040
you managed to get it posted on friday

1238
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,440
it's

1239
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,920
just track there so but yes

1240
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,000
i would suggest that we take the time to

1241
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,160
review that liaison statement

1242
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,280
and then launch an adoption call on the

1243
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,520
list with reference to that liaison

1244
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,960
statement

1245
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,119
yep yep i i agree with david on this

1246
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,040
and i think this work definitely falls

1247
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,920
within the scope of this working group

1248
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,480
so please read the draft please look at

1249
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,319
the liaison statement and please comment

1250
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,079
on list when we make the adoption call

1251
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,839
okay thank you any more questions or

1252
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,599
some of the people that chat have said

1253
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,599
that they they're interested as well

1254
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,040
good good okay and i'll stop sharing it

1255
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,200
thank you mike all right

1256
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,280
next up would be uh udp options

1257
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,960
is joe presenting or someone presenting

1258
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,200
for joe

1259
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,960
yeah guess who's going to volunteer yeah

1260
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,800
i'm doing it hi corey

1261
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,119
yeah how you get yes you're the usual

1262
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,880
suspect on this one

1263
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,680
and i don't have joel's shirt to go with

1264
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,520
i'm afraid it's a bit too cold up here

1265
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,720
but

1266
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,040
let's talk about udp options can we get

1267
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,720
the slides david

1268
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,400
um where would i find said slides

1269
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,680
in proceedings oh now i gotta go

1270
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,319
go go go over there uh justin

1271
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,040
joe's been working and responding to

1272
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,839
comments on udp options for a while

1273
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,880
this current draft zero nine is

1274
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,880
very much a update that includes

1275
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,440
responses to nearly all the issues which

1276
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,559
have been raised previously on the list

1277
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,359
so joe has a set of sites that reviews

1278
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,800
each of these in turn

1279
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,000
and we'll briefly tour over those with

1280
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,599
the last couple of issues at the end

1281
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,119
where he wants help from the working

1282
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,359
group

1283
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,920
so when we get joel's slides just a

1284
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,079
minute on the slides on my screen now i

1285
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,079
got to get him on yours

1286
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,680
hang on a minute here um

1287
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,850
[Music]

1288
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,839
that looks good

1289
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,040
i believe that's the one okay that looks

1290
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,240
good

1291
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,440
bingo so this is

1292
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,480
joel's set of updates he's made changes

1293
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,920
since zero nine

1294
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,040
um he added the unsafe

1295
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,280
option which is specifically for use

1296
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,880
with fragmentation

1297
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,000
um it tries to overcome the issues which

1298
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,440
we talked about in length

1299
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,640
two in person ietf so a little while ago

1300
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,520
now

1301
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,599
and it's produced a simpler

1302
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:39,920
fragmentation method

1303
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,280
he's also integrated fragmentation light

1304
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,880
so they're no longer separate things

1305
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,920
and he's revised the ocs pseudocode with

1306
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,119
more input from

1307
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,240
rafael zulu and to

1308
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,760
fix the zeroing issue he's clarified the

1309
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,119
acs is not dropped by default

1310
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:06,160
related the acs and the crc32

1311
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,119
also talked about acs and ae to say that

1312
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,839
they cover the payload only

1313
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:13,839
so a number of things all being talked

1314
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,000
about on the list all in joe's latest

1315
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,839
post to the list so we can go quickly

1316
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,839
through them next please

1317
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,760
um unsafe is basically there to deal

1318
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,559
with

1319
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,160
a specific option that

1320
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,200
follows another option and

1321
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,319
we need to judge the safety so this is

1322
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:37,599
the one place

1323
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,880
where the results of the

1324
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,000
receiving a udp option datagram

1325
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,520
doesn't result in the application

1326
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,119
receiving the datagram

1327
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,319
so there it's an important case and

1328
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,400
joel's written text to look at this and

1329
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,160
it's in the latest draft so

1330
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,240
that's that's around and just email

1331
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,440
documents next one

1332
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,640
most of that is related to fragment and

1333
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,960
the idea of fragments are to provide

1334
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,240
some rdma-like avoidance of copying user

1335
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,599
data but providing fragmentation

1336
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,280
the main reason for highlighting this

1337
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,000
here is the expected use case by

1338
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,760
joe includes pns

1339
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,960
and dns needs to send large records and

1340
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,559
this would be the mechanism that would

1341
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,960
be used if udp options were used with

1342
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,079
dns

1343
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,599
so it's important that people who have

1344
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,480
dns clue look at the fragmentation part

1345
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,400
next slide acs and ae have been

1346
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,079
um revised mainly revised in the text so

1347
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,839
not a lot of surprises here next one

1348
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,480
option process principles have been

1349
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,599
clarified

1350
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,520
and joe has strong opinions on this and

1351
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,480
he's expressed

1352
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,640
those consistently on the list and

1353
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,559
they're reflected in the draft

1354
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,839
um i think i think it's clear there's a

1355
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:02,640
new issue

1356
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,640
and the new issue is one relation to

1357
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,480
path mtu discovery again

1358
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,480
it's a very small thing but joe's

1359
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,720
looking for clarification

1360
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,200
when we talk about the larger segment

1361
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,839
size for a udp datagram

1362
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,319
do we mean the largest size of fragment

1363
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,920
or do we mean the larger

1364
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,480
size of fragmented data unit

1365
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,720
which one of these two numbers should

1366
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,760
appear in the mss

1367
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,720
options the maximum fragment size or the

1368
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,960
maximum fragment

1369
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,000
set of fragments that can be reassembled

1370
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,319
so there are two different parameters

1371
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,680
and they could be used in

1372
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,240
two different parts of the algorithm

1373
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,240
which one of these is most useful

1374
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,559
which one of these should be in the spec

1375
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,160
i ask the questions because they are

1376
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:48,720
things

1377
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,400
that joel's going to have to ask on the

1378
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,760
list to finish

1379
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,119
this this is the main um issue that's

1380
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:56,160
remaining

1381
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,160
next slide there's also a few pending

1382
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,839
changes but these are not

1383
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,839
um thought by joe to be significant

1384
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,880
he admitted that he misunderstood the

1385
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,319
way in which rock

1386
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,920
309.5 was specified it's complicated

1387
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,880
uh and the text has been updated with

1388
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,319
help from carsten boorman

1389
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:20,880
to get the text right so the text

1390
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:21,440
currently

1391
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,520
in the draft should be correct with

1392
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,200
respect to rock

1393
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,200
this isn't really a change in udp

1394
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,359
options it's a change in text

1395
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,040
the second one is how to address the mss

1396
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:33,440
issue

1397
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,680
what should be in an mss option what

1398
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,680
number goes there

1399
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,839
and if these two things are fixed

1400
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,119
then this document is

1401
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,280
complete in the respect of all the

1402
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,799
issues that were raised by the working

1403
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,880
group when we did the review

1404
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,119
so is there anything else that needs to

1405
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,880
be covered by this document before it

1406
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,079
goes for a working group last call

1407
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,480
that's my brief summary of joe's slides

1408
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,839
i'll happily take questions if there are

1409
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,839
any

1410
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,119
it sounds like we need to resolve the

1411
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,400
mss issue

1412
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,799
and working group last call can follow

1413
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,119
assuming there's no surprises in the

1414
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,160
others and

1415
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,319
glasgow might be just a real good idea

1416
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,000
simply to turn up whether

1417
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,520
whether whether all the details are

1418
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,280
right

1419
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,680
yeah and if you picked up on my

1420
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,599
representation of joe

1421
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,839
if you're from the dns area or an area

1422
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,240
that really would like to use

1423
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,240
a feature for sending fragments across

1424
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,000
the network or some other part of

1425
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,640
udp options please look at this now

1426
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,200
because

1427
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,119
we want users in the room should we lob

1428
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,760
an early review request over to ant

1429
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,760
areas i think that's where dns lives

1430
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,200
yeah we should do that when we do

1431
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,200
version 10.

1432
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,200
yeah okay

1433
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,319
let me make a note myself

1434
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:15,839
i can't write this morning

1435
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,760
okay now with a little any any other

1436
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,880
comments on this

1437
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,240
before i go and switch to nqb i think we

1438
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,920
should go frankie b

1439
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,520
all righty here we go um it takes a few

1440
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,960
clicks here

1441
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,960
i'm getting better at this though um

1442
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,079
should be that one yeah it's that one

1443
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,160
greg go ahead thank you

1444
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,880
um be able to hear me

1445
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,079
yes yes okay good i'm getting a pop-up

1446
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:01,200
saying it can't

1447
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,880
detect my audio all right so um uh

1448
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,319
there have been a couple of updates to

1449
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:08,960
the nqb draft since the last

1450
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,319
ietf meeting draft04

1451
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:16,000
which i uploaded at the deadline

1452
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,640
for the meeting it covered most of the

1453
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,960
changes that had been discussed at the

1454
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,119
last meeting and afterward

1455
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,839
and then while i was working on putting

1456
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,520
my slides together for this talk i

1457
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,640
realized

1458
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,160
uh there was one

1459
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,920
one of the to-do items i had not

1460
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,000
actually gotten around to doing

1461
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,960
and so i did that into draft205 which

1462
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,319
was published

1463
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,359
just as the servers opened again

1464
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,920
for this week so um and in the process

1465
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,200
um

1466
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,720
did a little bit of wordsmithing as well

1467
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,280
on draft 05. so the

1468
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,599
draft 4 the main changes are um

1469
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,240
first align the terminology with rfc

1470
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,760
2474

1471
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,480
um and cleaning all that up where it

1472
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,039
talks about

1473
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,680
standardizing phps and recommending

1474
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,680
dsdps and not the other way around

1475
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,520
or some other permutation of those terms

1476
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,799
um i think that's good now in the draft

1477
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,160
there's also a mention that um you just

1478
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,640
served

1479
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,599
uh was not intended for n10 usage and

1480
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,200
that's that's been reworked with some

1481
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:25,760
help from

1482
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,760
brian carpenter on that um and then

1483
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,680
um additional requirements um so

1484
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,720
this was discussed at the last ietf

1485
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,359
around the um

1486
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:44,880
implied behavior in earlier drafts that

1487
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,640
a network node or network that doesn't

1488
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,680
support

1489
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:53,359
the php should be aggregating nqb

1490
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,200
traffic with default traffic

1491
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,240
um and so now that's explicitly stated

1492
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,760
in the draft now

1493
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,960
um it's a little bit uh odd to be

1494
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,480
saying in a uh standards document what

1495
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,440
uh non-compliant uh nodes should should

1496
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,000
be doing

1497
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,200
we're adding requirements for for those

1498
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,960
that don't support the php

1499
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,720
but nonetheless i think it's valuable to

1500
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,720
do so i mean it is really the intention

1501
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,280
of

1502
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,960
the nqb um code point

1503
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,200
and traffic uh marking that

1504
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,880
if it's not being queued separately

1505
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,119
along the lines of what the draft

1506
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:34,160
uh discusses then it really should be

1507
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,680
aggregated with default traffic and then

1508
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,920
second piece was preserving the nqb

1509
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,960
marking

1510
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,160
um and that's good that that's going to

1511
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,599
be word smith but like i

1512
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,960
understand why you want it it's uh uh

1513
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,960
grim reality has a second opinion

1514
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,400
right it's just assured um yeah i

1515
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,280
understand

1516
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,520
uh it might not even even make it to

1517
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,200
that level uh i'll work that off list

1518
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,240
with you

1519
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,440
okay well appreciate that um

1520
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,480
and then um there there's around that

1521
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,720
uh discussion of aggregating with

1522
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,640
default uh in the requirement or

1523
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,000
destroyed around that

1524
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,599
there is a discussion around uh where

1525
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:20,480
that is probably fine um particular

1526
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,680
talks about

1527
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,799
shallow buffered switches and

1528
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,280
core network routers and switches that

1529
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,119
uh

1530
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,200
are not typically points of congestion

1531
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,359
and points of

1532
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:37,359
cueing delay in in networks

1533
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,720
next bullet removing a mention of

1534
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,319
aggregating network control

1535
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,400
traffic with nqb this is in the

1536
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,000
discussion of what traffic

1537
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,039
could be aggregated potentially uh in a

1538
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,880
node that supports the nqb

1539
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,160
php what other traffic might you want to

1540
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,799
potentially aggregate with nqb marks

1541
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:57,920
traffic

1542
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,760
network control was initially listed

1543
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,119
there uh

1544
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,480
and i was asked um to either

1545
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,280
put a lot of uh guard rails around that

1546
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,000
in the text

1547
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,920
or not mention that and so i

1548
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,000
took the easy path of not mentioning it

1549
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,280
the last bullet in that first lasso

1550
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,640
bullet i guess in the first

1551
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,280
section there underlined uh this is the

1552
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,920
new piece

1553
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,520
that i'd like to spend some time

1554
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,799
discussing today and this came out of

1555
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,079
reviews from a number of folks in the

1556
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,520
working group

1557
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,000
and suggestions on what would make

1558
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,440
lives easier for people to

1559
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,680
comply with some of these requirements

1560
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,760
and it amounts to

1561
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,200
asking for two code points

1562
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,680
to be assigned by ayanna and we'll go

1563
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,640
into the detail on that

1564
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,160
on the next slide um

1565
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,559
uh and then for the draft five with the

1566
01:05:58,559 --> 01:05:59,359
new updates

1567
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:03,520
um uh the one piece i'd missed in the

1568
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,720
draft four was

1569
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,079
uh adding some uh something more clear

1570
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,079
in the wi-fi section that

1571
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,400
rather than just talking about uh

1572
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,280
interaction or

1573
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
or interoperability with existing wi-fi

1574
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,480
networks

1575
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,760
really talk about the goal is that wi-fi

1576
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,200
networks in the future

1577
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,920
actually support the php and so that

1578
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:24,640
should really should be the

1579
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,680
recommendation

1580
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,680
and then um dealing with the

1581
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,680
interoperability with existing networks

1582
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,760
as a secondary aspect so that that's now

1583
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,440
in the graph five

1584
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,079
along with a bit of word smithing um in

1585
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,480
the new text that went into draft form

1586
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,760
let me quick check where you think the

1587
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,000
status is it looks like um

1588
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,079
most of the issues been closed uh

1589
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,000
there's one major issue on the next

1590
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,799
level two dscps and once that's resolved

1591
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,559
plus a little more text cleanup this is

1592
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:51,039
ready for

1593
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:56,079
your glass call correct that is correct

1594
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,319
all right so here we go all right so

1595
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:03,520
two dscps um so

1596
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,240
we're we're trying to work within the

1597
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,160
realities of the world as it is

1598
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:11,760
um maybe not as we wish it um

1599
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,319
were to be and so there are some

1600
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:15,039
constraints

1601
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,640
on the selection of

1602
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,559
the the code point to be used for nqb

1603
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,520
in order to make it useful in the near

1604
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:28,720
term as well as the long term

1605
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,400
and the two main constraints

1606
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,839
conflict with one another the first one

1607
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,319
is uh that there are hundreds of

1608
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,480
millions of wi-fi networks

1609
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,920
deployed around the world that map dscp

1610
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,440
into access categories the the wmm

1611
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,240
access categories um which provide

1612
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,079
separate cues as well as priority but

1613
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,400
not quite separate cues

1614
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,920
and and that mapping is by and large

1615
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,000
using what's called the default mapping

1616
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,920
and there is an interest in ensuring

1617
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,160
that the nqb code point can be handled

1618
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,119
in these

1619
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,480
existing wi-fi networks and that npb

1620
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,880
traffic can get a separate queue

1621
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,920
from the best effort default traffic

1622
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,198
and so in order to do that

1623
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,640
we have since the beginning proposed

1624
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,359
that

1625
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:31,439
the code point uh allocated for nqbb

1626
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,279
value 42 which has the bit pattern

1627
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,560
1 0 and then

1628
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,319
1 0 1 0 which would by default map into

1629
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,319
the video access category actually any

1630
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,880
code point with the value the binary

1631
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,920
value 1 0

1632
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,520
x x x x would map into the video access

1633
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,000
category

1634
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,560
on my file so that's one constraint um a

1635
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:55,920
related constraint that

1636
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,640
that works well with um this assignment

1637
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:58,960
of

1638
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,600
value 42 is that there's a lot of

1639
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,158
existing access network gear

1640
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,359
that can uh configure

1641
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,000
uh classifiers to to put traffic into

1642
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,198
different hues

1643
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:14,399
and has a bit masking capability

1644
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,839
in doing that that um dscp

1645
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:21,198
matching and so selecting a code point

1646
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:24,960
that um is maskable

1647
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,279
and and matches a a set of other

1648
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,040
code points that are already assigned by

1649
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,719
ana that are

1650
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:34,399
that carry traffic or indicate traffic

1651
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:37,279
that is compatible with nqb

1652
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:40,080
is a distinct advantage um there are a

1653
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,920
number of applications today that

1654
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,399
already mark their traffic but with some

1655
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,600
existing code points

1656
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,439
um in particular cs7 cs5 and ef

1657
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,158
that um is traffic that is compatible

1658
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:52,479
with

1659
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,239
nqb and um selects

1660
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:57,679
either the voice or video access

1661
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,440
category and wi-fi um

1662
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,640
and the belief is that um

1663
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,040
uh uh continuing to support

1664
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,040
those or supporting those applications

1665
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,400
um in

1666
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,440
networks that want to implement the

1667
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,000
uh npb code point would be facilitated

1668
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:16,719
by selecting

1669
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,920
a code point for nqb that can be

1670
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,600
easily grouped with some subset of those

1671
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,000
three code points minor note here

1672
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,520
um use cs5 and ef is one of the examples

1673
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,560
applications should not be marking cs7

1674
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:35,440
because

1675
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,120
um most uh diffserv uh boundaries

1676
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,360
have to bleach cs7 or to protect the

1677
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,400
routing protocols

1678
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,800
yeah and the context for for that list

1679
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,920
really is

1680
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,760
in uh end user networks home networks

1681
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,679
and and there cs7

1682
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:58,159
actually is used because the default

1683
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:01,040
wi-fi mapping

1684
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,159
map cs7 to the voice access category

1685
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,520
things like ef and voice admit

1686
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:09,199
go to the video access category by

1687
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,600
default so

1688
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,640
so dealing with the reality of um yeah

1689
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,400
uh usage in in home networks

1690
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,080
uh but point taken um

1691
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,320
the the next rationale there that

1692
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,000
conflicts with the first one is

1693
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,760
that um across interconnections

1694
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,440
um it was pointed out that um

1695
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,280
particularly for network networks that

1696
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,480
run mpls

1697
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,880
cores that traffic has to be aggregated

1698
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,880
or dhcps have to be aggregated in order

1699
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,400
to

1700
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,880
fit into the available mpls traffic

1701
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,320
categories and that

1702
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,239
uh nqb traffic could very easily be

1703
01:11:58,239 --> 01:11:58,719
treated

1704
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,760
the same as default which would be the

1705
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,400
the intention in a core network in a lot

1706
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,840
of cases

1707
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,040
if the code point were something that

1708
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,640
matched the pattern zero zero

1709
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,920
zero xxx in binary

1710
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,280
so um uh and

1711
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,840
um if it were if such a code point were

1712
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,880
selected

1713
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,600
then those mpls core networks and

1714
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,440
transit networks could

1715
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,880
very easily carry the nqb code point

1716
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,080
through unbleached and so that both of

1717
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,040
those are

1718
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,679
desirable properties that would enable

1719
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,080
end-to-end usage of nqb in the near firm

1720
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,000
so that leaves us with these two

1721
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,159
conflicting

1722
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:49,040
constraints around the assignment again

1723
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,000
one

1724
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,239
being that uh the code point is binary

1725
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,320
one zero xxx

1726
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,159
the other one that it's a binary zero

1727
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,239
zero zero xxx

1728
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:02,000
um uh in some off list discussion

1729
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,320
um uh uh we came to the

1730
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,800
agreement that uh it would be a

1731
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,840
potentially

1732
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,640
uh useful set or a pair to choose uh

1733
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,159
would be 42 and two

1734
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,000
42 matching what we've been proposing

1735
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,960
all along for the

1736
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,440
wi-fi coexistence and access network

1737
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,320
coexistence

1738
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,840
aspects um and then the value two is

1739
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,560
simply

1740
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,960
um bleaching the top three bits of the

1741
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,159
code point

1742
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:32,880
that is actually already a pathology

1743
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,080
that's in place in some

1744
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,800
parts of the internet and so naturally

1745
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,000
uh

1746
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,960
dhcp 42 mark traffic would become the

1747
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,640
cp2 in some cases

1748
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,520
um and in our case that's an easy

1749
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:46,400
effects

1750
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,600
or easy easy um change to make in the in

1751
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,440
the dhcp

1752
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,920
um and so the way that's kind of

1753
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:54,880
structured in the

1754
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,960
draft is that end hosts

1755
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,320
applications um essentially mark traffic

1756
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,840
is 42.

1757
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:07,440
as they send you the the host is the

1758
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,679
um the entity that understands its

1759
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,600
ending behavior and understands whether

1760
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,520
it's complying with the intention of the

1761
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,199
mqb code point

1762
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:19,040
um and the php and so it marks at 42

1763
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,239
and then that then traverses

1764
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,159
home networks and wi-fi links and gets

1765
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,760
the appropriate treatment there

1766
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,120
it's um this benefit on access networks

1767
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:29,360
of

1768
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,719
having the value 42 and then somewhere

1769
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,920
uh prior to interconnection the isp is

1770
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,760
responsible for

1771
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,280
remapping 42 into the value 2

1772
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,320
and using two across the interconnection

1773
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,960
and then at the far side before traffic

1774
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:47,920
is

1775
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:51,360
delivered into an end user network

1776
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,040
there is another remapping back to 42.

1777
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,719
and diagram shows

1778
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,440
a client and server case it could also

1779
01:14:59,440 --> 01:14:59,920
be

1780
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,640
client to client um you know a

1781
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,000
peer-to-peer kind of communication as

1782
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,040
well but

1783
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,600
um that is the the gist of it um and

1784
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,280
that's i think the main discussion point

1785
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,960
today is

1786
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,920
your concerns or

1787
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:16,560
thoughts about the concept of having two

1788
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,159
dscps

1789
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:23,040
to deal with this

1790
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,520
these two constraints um and then the

1791
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,120
specific values of the code points i

1792
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:27,600
think

1793
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,960
um you know 42 and two is maybe a second

1794
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,560
theory topic that we should uh

1795
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,560
touch on as well so

1796
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,520
um

1797
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,199
i guess if anyone has feedback on this

1798
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,040
two dscp concept any concerns with that

1799
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,800
okay um do you want to get do you want

1800
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,480
to do the discussion now we're going to

1801
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,000
get through the rest of your slides

1802
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,560
we're a little tight on time as usual

1803
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,480
okay well i can the rest of the slides

1804
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,719
are kind of wrap up so i can go ahead

1805
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:57,840
and do that then we can have open

1806
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,480
discussion

1807
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,440
that's okay okay next slide and just the

1808
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,800
other thing is we need to figure out

1809
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,920
where to put in

1810
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,360
uh the uh honest presentation on dscp2

1811
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,440
measurements

1812
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,960
okay so that's one remaining slides

1813
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,880
so this is just to say everything that

1814
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,560
we identified the last ihf

1815
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:18,480
to do is either done or this we decided

1816
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,800
not to do it uh

1817
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,080
checklist checked next um

1818
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,520
and then discussion so uh okay with two

1819
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,120
dscps and then which ones

1820
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,480
and so see anna's talk which has some

1821
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,520
interesting

1822
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,960
insight into that topic and then

1823
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,360
where do we go from here on the draft

1824
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,640
all right so something we're going to do

1825
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,120
is get anna up to talk about

1826
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:46,960
uh dscp2 and then come back to this for

1827
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,560
some more general discussion

1828
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,360
and try to watch try try to watch the

1829
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,360
clock while we're doing that

1830
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:58,080
um okay hang on where are ah

1831
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,840
all these windows

1832
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:11,440
okay hang on a minute here

1833
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:18,080
ah there it is anna go ahead

1834
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:22,320
uh hello can you hear me yes

1835
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,679
great um yeah so uh hi uh i'm

1836
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,600
anna i work with gory fairhurst at the

1837
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,120
university of aberdeen

1838
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,520
um i will talk to you today about some

1839
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,120
measurement data new measurement data

1840
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,480
that we have around the code points for

1841
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,360
t2 and 2

1842
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,199
that are proposed in the in the mqb

1843
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:39,280
draft that greg just presented

1844
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,440
so if we could go on to the next slide

1845
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,960
please

1846
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,920
um the data is is is new as it addresses

1847
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:46,640
some gaps

1848
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:48,560
um there is there already is some

1849
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,400
literature about the traversability of

1850
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,440
code points

1851
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,080
including 42 and 2 uh but only in the

1852
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,360
core of the internet

1853
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,760
and all of that is based on uh on active

1854
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,440
measurements so you generate traffic

1855
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,640
with some dhcp

1856
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,239
and then you set it out in the internet

1857
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,840
and you look at what comes out of the

1858
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,679
other side and what changes you see

1859
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:08,239
at every hop in the path um but today

1860
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,760
what we are going to be looking at

1861
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,159
is passive data in the core of the

1862
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:13,120
internet i mean

1863
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,679
actual traffic uh in the wild and this

1864
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,280
is uh this is a data set that is

1865
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,000
provided by

1866
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,760
keda um we're also going to be briefly

1867
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,520
looking at a set of edge measurements

1868
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,840
uh that are done from ripe atlas probes

1869
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,920
uh in the past we've not had that much

1870
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,560
information on edge networks

1871
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,120
um and finally we've i've looked at a

1872
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,560
few sets of code points

1873
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,400
um primarily dhcp's 40 2 but then a

1874
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,800
couple of other pairs that

1875
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,960
would fulfill the criteria that that

1876
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,400
grid just talked about that is

1877
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,760
also specified in the aqb draft

1878
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,640
so if you could go on to the next slide

1879
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,760
i will try to keep this

1880
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,600
as short as i can um so the passive data

1881
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,920
this is provided by keda it comes from a

1882
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,600
monitor that sits somewhere

1883
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,520
in a data center it collects all the

1884
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,120
traffic on a bad bull link

1885
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,640
backbone link rather where a tier one

1886
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:07,360
isp

1887
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,400
peers the traffic is anonymized

1888
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,640
all of the payload is removed and what

1889
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,679
we are left with

1890
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:17,040
with is ip headers and transport headers

1891
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:17,520
as well

1892
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,560
so we can look at the dscp markings

1893
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,120
in total we analyzed around 18 billion

1894
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,480
packets

1895
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,719
they were all collected in two hours in

1896
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,320
two different years

1897
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,440
at the same location if we move on to

1898
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:37,839
the next slide

1899
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,480
and yes here is a table that analyzes

1900
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:41,600
what the scps

1901
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,520
were seen on all of these packets we

1902
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,040
looked at and

1903
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,040
i pay particular attention to those that

1904
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,040
are proposed in the nqb draft

1905
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,880
so as you can see in the table i've

1906
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,480
split the traffic per year

1907
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
per direction the the traffic is

1908
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,400
bidirectional

1909
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,960
and also per protocol as in ipv4 versus

1910
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,560
ipv6 i've not split it per

1911
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,760
transport um so first observation that

1912
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,640
you can make is that

1913
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,280
uh the most traffic uh just carries the

1914
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,159
scp-0

1915
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,840
so um only zeros are carried in the dhcp

1916
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,600
field and this is the case for around 80

1917
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,679
to 90 percent of the traffic regardless

1918
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:17,520
of how you split it

1919
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,719
um we expect this and this corresponds

1920
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:21,360
to

1921
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,480
uh to be the best effort

1922
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,560
the second thing that you can notice

1923
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,159
which is a bit more unexpected

1924
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:30,000
is that in all of the cases regardless

1925
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,159
of how you split the traffic

1926
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:33,760
you can see traffic marked with the

1927
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:35,360
scp-2

1928
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,719
which is proposed in the nqb draft

1929
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,560
in fact this can be as much as 90

1930
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:41,920
percent of all

1931
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,000
traffic carries this particular mark

1932
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,719
this is not a trivial amount of traffic

1933
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:48,400
and we'll explore why this happens in a

1934
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,840
later slide

1935
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:52,239
uh but something else to notice here is

1936
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,480
that all of the other codes don't appear

1937
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,320
code points rather don't appear nearly

1938
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,600
as much as

1939
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,639
codepoint2 and this includes chord point

1940
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:03,440
42 which is uh proposed in the nqb draft

1941
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,320
that's a good thing

1942
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,440
it means nothing uses it uh but also in

1943
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,880
all of for all of the other sets of

1944
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,239
chord points that we used as

1945
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:13,520
uh we we looked at like um 44 and 4 and

1946
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,000
46

1947
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,159
and 6 they don't appear they only appear

1948
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:19,040
for a fraction of the traffic

1949
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,800
so the key takeaway from here from the

1950
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,080
slide is that um

1951
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:23,600
on this particular link a lot of the

1952
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,440
traffic ends up carrying the same

1953
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,560
code point uh that is proposed um

1954
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,960
for nqb traffic and because we see it in

1955
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,480
both directions and from

1956
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,280
different prefixes uh we we believe it

1957
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,120
to be the result of uh several different

1958
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,639
networks so not just one network but

1959
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:39,199
several

1960
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:42,000
that remark in this way so if we could

1961
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,320
go on to the next slide

1962
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,719
uh which talks about uh the tests that

1963
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:48,960
we did at the edge

1964
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,000
um so we did this test on the ripe atlas

1965
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,320
platform which has um geographically

1966
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,239
distributed probes

1967
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:57,679
and in fact in the picture that you can

1968
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,360
see on your screen right now

1969
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,880
these are all the the probes that

1970
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,360
participated in the measurement

1971
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,440
and from all of these we sent tcp

1972
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,400
traffic

1973
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,719
marked with dscp42 towards our own

1974
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:09,600
server

1975
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,320
at the university of aberdeen and the

1976
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,760
goal here was to understand

1977
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,560
what remarking happens along a path note

1978
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,000
that this is a trace route measurement

1979
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,560
so

1980
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,560
we can actually see what happens at each

1981
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,800
hop

1982
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,040
and what we find out is that not much

1983
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,480
remarking happened uh

1984
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,400
happens at at the first stop so in the

1985
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,239
edge network where the probe is

1986
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,639
uh with only about five percent of all

1987
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,880
of the dhcps are zeroed

1988
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,960
uh there but by the time the packets

1989
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,560
make it to our server to the end of the

1990
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:39,440
path

1991
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,960
um the scp-42 survives only on about

1992
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,600
in about 20 percent of traffic so on

1993
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,880
around 20

1994
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,280
percent of the path percent of the paths

1995
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,840
rather

1996
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,679
um we also see that about seven percent

1997
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,440
of packets have the first three bits of

1998
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,719
the field zeroed out

1999
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,840
so this is basically toss bleaching so

2000
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,440
they arrive at the destination is the

2001
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,639
cp2

2002
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:04,080
which is uh the other proposed code

2003
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,400
point for nqb

2004
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,400
um and interestingly you see about three

2005
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,320
percent of them that have the last three

2006
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,679
bits as opposed the first three bits

2007
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:13,360
zeroed out which results in code point

2008
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,480
40

2009
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,920
uh or cs5 uh i mean

2010
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,840
uh greg mentioned that cs5 is ngb

2011
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,120
compatible

2012
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,040
uh traffic but also in this case uh

2013
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,280
it might result from a wi-fi network

2014
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,840
pathology

2015
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:32,000
however on the majority of paths this is

2016
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
not the case on about 60 percent of the

2017
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:34,560
past

2018
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,120
packets have the entire field zeroed out

2019
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,080
so by the time they

2020
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,280
they reach the destination um uh

2021
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,880
they carry the sap zero and this

2022
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,960
corresponds to best effort

2023
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,320
so uh if we move on

2024
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,840
to the next slide um what do we learn

2025
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,520
from all of this data

2026
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,000
well i just uh mentioned that where edge

2027
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:56,639
and edges

2028
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,400
edge networks are concerned you see a

2029
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,840
lot of bleaching

2030
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,920
and resulting in code.0 um but

2031
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,000
the keta data results were surprising

2032
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,120
because now we've

2033
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,199
we know of at least one backbone link

2034
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:10,400
we're using

2035
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,199
a code point where codepoint2 is used

2036
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,000
and appears on

2037
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,639
a lot of the traffic and this is most

2038
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,080
likely due to the toss precedence

2039
01:24:18,080 --> 01:24:18,639
bleaching

2040
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,120
on many packets that maybe have arrived

2041
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,239
from various

2042
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:25,280
edge networks carrying the sap such as

2043
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,360
af-11 or f21 or

2044
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,320
31 or 41 that toss bleach to the value

2045
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,760
2.

2046
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,320
so what i'm trying to say is that you

2047
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,080
have these popular chord points like af

2048
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,760
11 and 21 that have established

2049
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,000
semantics

2050
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,120
which end up at the other edge

2051
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,480
uh s2 because because of how popular

2052
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,639
they are and because there's a lot of uh

2053
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,080
because the practice of toss bleaching

2054
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,080
is still quite widespread

2055
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,320
um i'm guessing this this might mean

2056
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,080
that you have you could have potentially

2057
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:56,719
a lot of

2058
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,600
q building traffic that may be remarked

2059
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,679
as nqb

2060
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:03,920
and that's the only implication here but

2061
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:04,960
we also saw that

2062
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:09,120
codepoint42 is not used

2063
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,560
which brings me to my last point and if

2064
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,600
you go to the next slide

2065
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,400
so my last point is that there are a lot

2066
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,520
of interactions

2067
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,600
and different types of remarking that

2068
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,199
can happen on many different paths in

2069
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,440
many different types of network

2070
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:30,800
when it comes to div surf code points so

2071
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,400
all of these kind of should be kept in

2072
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,800
mind when you assign new ones

2073
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,560
and me and gory and another one of our

2074
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,679
colleagues from the university of

2075
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:38,639
aberdeen wrote

2076
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,159
an internet graph that attempts to

2077
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:42,000
provide some input on what pathology

2078
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,080
remarking pathologies exist

2079
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,400
and what other semantics exists with

2080
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,639
regards to code points

2081
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,239
and we're at the stage where we'd love

2082
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:51,840
any input on this

2083
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,199
thank you very much if you've already

2084
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,840
commented

2085
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,440
and provided feedback on the draft we

2086
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,679
will be uploading a new version soon

2087
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:01,440
but if you haven't and you think you can

2088
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,320
do so and are interested please do it

2089
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,120
um yes this concludes my presentation

2090
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:09,040
thank you for listening

2091
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:12,159
are there any questions let's leave

2092
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:16,159
that hang on where am i

2093
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:20,638
let's leave that slide up for questions

2094
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,840
um

2095
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,440
great go ahead okay um

2096
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,239
thanks anna um this is definitely really

2097
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:40,880
good

2098
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,120
useful work for helping help me select

2099
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,000
code points here

2100
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,199
for nqb it

2101
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:51,199
looks like a potential candidate

2102
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:54,400
pair of code points could be uh

2103
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,679
45 and 5. going back to your

2104
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:02,719
data it looks like

2105
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,000
5 is not uh used

2106
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,400
not it was not seen heavily um

2107
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,040
there were a couple of instances i guess

2108
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,760
the direction

2109
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,639
b both uh 2018 and 2019 where

2110
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:22,719
there was a fair amount of code 0.5

2111
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,639
but in other cases much less

2112
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,840
and the value 45 is available in the

2113
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,000
um assignment

2114
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,520
pool as well those other values

2115
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:44,000
4 and 6 the corresponding value

2116
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,440
in the upper part of the space uh 44 and

2117
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,320
46 i

2118
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,679
think those are already assigned 46 is

2119
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:52,719
ef

2120
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,480
44 is voice admit um

2121
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,560
so if you if we want to have a pair

2122
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,639
for which the the low three bits are the

2123
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:03,760
same which i think

2124
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,719
there's value in doing that um 45 and

2125
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:07,760
five might be one

2126
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,600
that we look at interjecting as a

2127
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,000
chair before going congratulating the

2128
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,880
next person

2129
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,600
in line um voice admit is definitely out

2130
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,639
of the question

2131
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:22,320
however ef is intriguing

2132
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:25,840
it might be plausible since nqb traffic

2133
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,960
doesn't build cues if you have high

2134
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,400
assurance of that

2135
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,800
it is not out of the question to carry

2136
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,440
it as

2137
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:36,560
ef in the edge networks

2138
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,159
and i don't know how to reach conclusion

2139
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:39,840
on that i'm just raising that as an

2140
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,400
interest

2141
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,760
interesting one to dig into

2142
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,800
yes interesting document

2143
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,880
responding to that um the uh

2144
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,480
you in existing wi-fi networks um

2145
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:58,400
ef and 45 and 42 and

2146
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,159
all those which we've been talking about

2147
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,600
and that upper range

2148
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,840
would go into the same access category

2149
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,920
and so from that perspective it would be

2150
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,120
equivalent um and then if in a

2151
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,320
further network hop ef gets aggregated

2152
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:15,440
with nqb traffic either because they're

2153
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,719
in different code points and they get

2154
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,239
classified together or because they

2155
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:19,840
share the same code point

2156
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,199
that would be fine too the

2157
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:26,880
concern i think i would have is that um

2158
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,480
recommendations around future wi-fi

2159
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:31,199
support

2160
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:35,040
for nqb versus ef um

2161
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,320
and ef is generally

2162
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,080
considered traffic that should be

2163
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,679
prioritized in networks

2164
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,040
whereas nqb is explicitly not supposed

2165
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,239
to be prioritized

2166
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:50,840
and so the recommendation for future

2167
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,679
wi-fi uh

2168
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:58,159
nodes is to provide a separate queue

2169
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,639
in the best effort access category for

2170
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:02,719
nqb

2171
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,080
and is that what we would want

2172
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:11,600
to recommend for ef traffic as well

2173
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:17,920
okay just want to raise possibility uh

2174
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,840
vd go ahead

2175
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,280
hurry

2176
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:29,600
hello can you hear me yes yes okay

2177
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,199
cool a question for greg so for

2178
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:35,760
in the nqb draft i haven't read the

2179
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,639
draft i just

2180
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,600
saw the slides right now uh is there is

2181
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:40,719
a recommendation

2182
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,840
um to for the

2183
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,320
edge to use to bleach any of these 42 44

2184
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,360
or 46 to

2185
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,560
2 instead of zero so that

2186
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:57,280
it can be utilized for the nqb

2187
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:00,080
traffic on the downstream is that the

2188
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,280
recommendation

2189
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,880
because most of the traffic gets

2190
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,840
bleached to zero

2191
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,120
um yeah the intention is

2192
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,960
here um the intention is

2193
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:31,840
test one two

2194
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:37,440
all right there we go

2195
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,000
okay good thank you um yes the intention

2196
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,120
is that

2197
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,920
we enable the pass-through of this code

2198
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:44,560
point

2199
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,000
um end to end and we do whatever we can

2200
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,639
to

2201
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,400
ensure that that's possible um yesterday

2202
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,760
the vast majority if not all isps

2203
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,800
particular residential customers bleach

2204
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,960
the code point

2205
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:03,280
to zero or to some other you know fixed

2206
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,320
value

2207
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:08,000
um most often zero and

2208
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,880
so the recommendation in the draft is

2209
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,440
that

2210
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,360
it'd be carried all the way through and

2211
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:15,280
as the diagram shows

2212
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,320
uh you know is 42

2213
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:22,080
in the home network

2214
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,880
segment yeah for traffic both upstream

2215
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,320
and downstream

2216
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,760
to the user um there is one kind of

2217
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,960
caveat there that

2218
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,239
um you since the wi-fi links don't

2219
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:35,120
support the full

2220
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:39,520
php uh requirements that

2221
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,520
there could be some uh

2222
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:46,239
non-ideal behaviors that might happen if

2223
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:47,520
if

2224
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,360
traffic is not being policed and

2225
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,040
monitored and

2226
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:53,600
your random traffic comes into the isp

2227
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,560
network

2228
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,840
uh marked uh with this low value say two

2229
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,239
or five and if that's the last that's

2230
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,520
chosen

2231
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:04,719
and so it recommends that um unless the

2232
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:05,920
operator has

2233
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,040
implemented some safeguards to prevent

2234
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,600
that from happening that they leave the

2235
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,520
code point at the low value

2236
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:15,920
so that uh the traffic stays in the best

2237
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,320
effort access category on wi-fi but

2238
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,320
the extent that the the isp is

2239
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,000
supporting the php and

2240
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,719
supporting uh those safeguards then yeah

2241
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,320
yeah the intention is that

2242
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,719
it is 42 both for upstream traffic and

2243
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,080
downstream traffic in

2244
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,520
the uh customer's home network right now

2245
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,040
there is a risk there in uh on this data

2246
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,840
which is that there is existing use of

2247
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,920
code 0.2 traffic on the

2248
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:44,480
uh observed on the backbone and that

2249
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,719
will get up marked to 42 even though it

2250
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:48,960
didn't start out as 42.

2251
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:53,120
yeah exactly gloria

2252
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:58,719
thinking here that there might be two

2253
01:33:58,719 --> 01:33:59,920
outcomes

2254
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,760
the first one might be that after

2255
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,320
thinking through anna's presentation

2256
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,960
and the discussion on this topic that

2257
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:07,679
greg might

2258
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,480
finalize on 42 and 2 and that'll have to

2259
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,239
propose to the working group so that's

2260
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:13,840
one option

2261
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,920
the other option might be that after

2262
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:17,199
thinking through this that

2263
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:19,040
greg wants to try and propose a

2264
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,440
different pair of dscps

2265
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,719
and then i'm wondering perhaps if we

2266
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:24,400
could have a little interim or something

2267
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,800
before the next ietf to discuss

2268
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,440
the different option if one emerges so

2269
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,360
we weren't kind of clocked by ietf

2270
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,000
meetings on

2271
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,840
assigning a diff serve called point yeah

2272
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,080
if it if if it gets confusing enough an

2273
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,280
interim would make up

2274
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,400
would make a whole lot of sense um

2275
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,520
but i think it's definitely

2276
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:43,760
possibilities anna you want to take the

2277
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,719
last word on this

2278
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,840
and then we need to move on

2279
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:51,040
uh say that again please did you you're

2280
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,159
marcus salon did you want to say

2281
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:54,480
anything more

2282
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:58,000
um no i just i just had a thought um

2283
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,280
because i think whichever route you go

2284
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,199
whichever pair of code points you have

2285
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,000
will you

2286
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,600
do you not need to have some sort of

2287
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,119
protection just in case

2288
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,040
that q building traffic actually ends up

2289
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,400
in the nqbq

2290
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,480
regardless of what of what code points

2291
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:12,719
are used so if you have such a box and

2292
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:13,760
this box is

2293
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,600
is in the isp network perhaps you don't

2294
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,440
actually need to choose a different

2295
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:21,839
pair of code points from 40 to 12

2296
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,960
if i understand this correctly

2297
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,280
okay

2298
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,000
because rudiger might want to make a

2299
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,760
quick comment on this yes let's look

2300
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,560
we're gonna go ahead

2301
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:43,839
go ahead

2302
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,840
we'll have a hard time to distinguish it

2303
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,040
from it's coming through now

2304
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:56,400
hello yes you're there well

2305
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,320
i have a hard time to distinguish it

2306
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,679
from real nqb

2307
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:02,960
traffic at the bng

2308
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,080
so i'd prefer a different dhcp than two

2309
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,360
thanks okay so this is a great

2310
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:10,000
conversation

2311
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,520
to have on the list but i would

2312
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,679
encourage people to get in there

2313
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,239
and try and make some decisions so we

2314
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:18,800
can move forward

2315
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,040
okay all right and we are five minutes

2316
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,199
behind schedule

2317
01:36:24,199 --> 01:36:27,119
unfortunately gorgeous i'm gonna try to

2318
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:29,280
stuff the satellite slides in here very

2319
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,560
quickly

2320
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,960
yeah as we start the individual drafts

2321
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:34,320
let's do a

2322
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,239
heads-up display of the satellite one

2323
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:38,400
and then move through

2324
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,920
um robin and then finally back to the

2325
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:45,600
um the final sites okay so tom

2326
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,239
um please press your mic and talk for

2327
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:50,718
two minutes

2328
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:53,360
this

2329
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:59,360
and we're not getting audio now you're

2330
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,360
getting audio go for it okay next slide

2331
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,040
please

2332
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:06,320
uh so nicholas gory emil and john

2333
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,960
had um a draft that was targeting quick

2334
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,000
where they looked at satellite

2335
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,760
considerations for the quick protocol

2336
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,040
and part of that was giving something

2337
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,520
that was um testable by implementation

2338
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,960
so that satellite wasn't left out of the

2339
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:17,840
story

2340
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:19,679
gauri asked me to to look at this draft

2341
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,199
to try and align the text with

2342
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:24,880
um rfc 2488 and instead

2343
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:27,440
uh we as a group of authors decided that

2344
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,400
the document would be

2345
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:30,880
better suited just approaching transport

2346
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,159
protocols generally

2347
01:37:32,159 --> 01:37:33,840
and what they need to get from from

2348
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,600
satellite and what satellite deployment

2349
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:36,159
does

2350
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:37,920
there are two documents in the rc series

2351
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,360
that really cover

2352
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,639
satellite use cases 2488 and 2760

2353
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,320
they both came from the tcp sap working

2354
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,080
group which concluded in 2000

2355
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:49,199
and since 2000 uh geo satellite services

2356
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:49,760
become

2357
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:51,199
massively faster there's just a lot more

2358
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:53,119
capacity available and

2359
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,280
the considerations in these documents

2360
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,199
were sort of superseded by

2361
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,119
split tcp implementing the things they

2362
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,760
discussed and so the split tcps are

2363
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:03,280
implemented with peps

2364
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,639
uh and and this works great for tcp um

2365
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,000
most tcp connections don't actually

2366
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,520
realize they're going over satellite

2367
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,199
because they have the protocol split

2368
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:11,920
down

2369
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:14,320
and satellite actually works quite well

2370
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,360
uh apart from for

2371
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,360
latency critical tasks the problem we

2372
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,800
have is that peps are a deployment

2373
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,719
barrier for new features for tcp

2374
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,880
and they are impractical to deploy for

2375
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,840
for quick or

2376
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,239
or with vpns and we're starting now to

2377
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,199
see um

2378
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:28,639
new satellite systems that are actually

2379
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:29,920
getting prominent so we're seeing a lot

2380
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,119
of leo stuff come up

2381
01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:33,520
and we're seeing neo and there's a big

2382
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,199
case with hybrid operations

2383
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:38,639
with uh 5g and so we want to create an

2384
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,159
update to 2488 and the advice of 2760

2385
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:43,760
and document the relevant transport

2386
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,040
character characteristics of these

2387
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,320
satellite networks

2388
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,800
so that we can um give advice for

2389
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,400
implementers and so we can design and

2390
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,239
test and verify that code will work well

2391
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:53,040
and work well

2392
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,600
in these different cases and what we

2393
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,360
want from the working group is input on

2394
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,719
what we need to talk about

2395
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:01,199
and so we have experience with

2396
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,560
geoproviders because the

2397
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,239
authors group typically work in

2398
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:05,679
geosystems

2399
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:08,639
but what we really want is input in leo

2400
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:09,280
and mio

2401
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,119
and then input from satellite network

2402
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,199
operators application platform

2403
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:15,840
operators and protocol implementers so

2404
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,520
that we're giving the best advice so

2405
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,360
that the satellite use cases are

2406
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,080
understood

2407
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,679
so i just like to ask everyone the

2408
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:24,159
working group to read the document

2409
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:25,679
and provide feedback we'll take feedback

2410
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,679
on the mailing list uh individually

2411
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,280
and we also have a github and i'll post

2412
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,719
a link to the github in the chat and

2413
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:31,199
that is

2414
01:39:31,199 --> 01:39:33,280
all i want so please please please

2415
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,480
please read and comment

2416
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,560
on the draft to the list and or to and

2417
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,679
or to the authors

2418
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,040
okay next up is once i

2419
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:44,800
let me go find it uh is q log

2420
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,920
and i would ask uh both of the next uh

2421
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,040
main two presenters uh to try to do it

2422
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,199
in about 10 minutes each

2423
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,440
sorry we're squeezed on time robin go

2424
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,759
for it

2425
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:03,040
yeah if i can have slides uh hang on

2426
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:06,400
just a minute i need to go ah

2427
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,638
yes you do need you do need to

2428
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,840
go find it um

2429
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:23,760
bingo that should be it there we go

2430
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,080
excellent so thanks for giving me a

2431
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,440
little bit of time to talk about q

2432
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,760
log um again which has been discussed in

2433
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:31,040
in tsv area

2434
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,080
before and also throughout the week

2435
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,840
so next slide please q log started as as

2436
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:40,400
the quick login project intended to make

2437
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:41,280
it easier to

2438
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,119
to analyze and debug quicken http 3.

2439
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:48,639
next slide this is because what you

2440
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:50,239
would normally do for something like

2441
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:52,000
tcps you would take a packet capture

2442
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:52,719
somewhere and

2443
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,800
use something like wireshark to analyze

2444
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,639
that you can still do that with quick

2445
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,000
but it's a bit more difficult

2446
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,280
next slide because quickl of course

2447
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,040
almost entirely encrypts also its

2448
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,159
transport level

2449
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,080
uh metadata so to do that you would have

2450
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,080
to store the entire packet capture which

2451
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,119
gets quite large

2452
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:11,199
and you would also need to store the

2453
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,560
decryption secrets

2454
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:14,880
which is of course terrible for privacy

2455
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,480
and there's a second important aspect to

2456
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,239
this next slide indeed

2457
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,760
is that not everything about the

2458
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,520
protocol is of course sent on the wire

2459
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,440
especially things like just control

2460
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,040
parameters are typically not

2461
01:41:25,040 --> 01:41:27,600
analyzable in that way so for quick

2462
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,480
reproposed

2463
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,440
next slide a new approach instead of

2464
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,440
doing a network capture we would

2465
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,760
capture at the end points directly from

2466
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,280
the implementations

2467
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:39,679
and qlog there is the idea that we can

2468
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:42,880
have a single format a single schema

2469
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,320
that is used across the different

2470
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,320
implementations so everyone logs in the

2471
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,679
exact same way

2472
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,840
this enables us to create reusable

2473
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,520
tooling in a much more

2474
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,639
straightforward fashion so next slide

2475
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:57,360
so keylog is far from rocket science we

2476
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,639
currently just serialize this to json

2477
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,480
getting for example a definition of what

2478
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,719
a received packet should look like

2479
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:07,440
or indeed you can just control metrics

2480
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,840
update on the right side

2481
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,639
next so using qlog as an input format we

2482
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:13,520
also created

2483
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,760
quite a bit of tooling for that for

2484
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,159
example this type of sequence diagram or

2485
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:20,480
next

2486
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,760
tcp trace alike tool to help debug

2487
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:24,719
congestion

2488
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,960
and flow control issues in the protocols

2489
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,480
next slide

2490
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,679
um bishop pros has worked quite well

2491
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,080
within quick with the majority of the

2492
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,320
implementations actually output in this

2493
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,560
single format and for example facebook

2494
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,840
actually using it in

2495
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,920
production at scale as well to to

2496
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,080
monitor their actual quick

2497
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,840
deployments next slide

2498
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,840
up until now q log has been two

2499
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,040
individual drafts

2500
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,080
and so because of this this

2501
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,840
i would say proof that it can work in

2502
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,480
practice we will probably adopt it in a

2503
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:00,000
quick working group

2504
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,080
um within the next couple of months as

2505
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,920
part of their recharter

2506
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,679
so a main goal of that is of course

2507
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:08,080
flashing this out for quick and hp3

2508
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,159
but the main reason that i'm here today

2509
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,400
and other working groups this week

2510
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,480
um is because we also envision qlogs to

2511
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,639
be useful for many other protocols as

2512
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:17,119
well

2513
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:19,600
this basic concept of just using a

2514
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,520
structured standard format

2515
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,080
at the endpoints can be useful in many

2516
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:24,880
different

2517
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,960
situations and we actually have pilot

2518
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,080
projects running for

2519
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,920
for the ones that we that have listed

2520
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,560
there below for example tcp is an

2521
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,320
obvious target there where we are

2522
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,320
extracting some events using

2523
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:39,440
for example evpf from the kernel there

2524
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,159
are also

2525
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:41,679
many people interested in doing this

2526
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,520
from multibots tcp

2527
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,440
and quick of course because these can

2528
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,119
get quite difficult to

2529
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:50,159
to debug and fine-tune in practice

2530
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:54,080
next slide um this this goal of making q

2531
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,000
log usable for more protocols is

2532
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,520
actually already visible in the current

2533
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,880
drafts we have the

2534
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,800
event definitions for quick and industry

2535
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,880
are separate from what we're calling the

2536
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:04,320
main schema

2537
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,320
which kind of has the protocol agnostic

2538
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,239
stuff of the format

2539
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:10,960
and the hope is that this can grow to a

2540
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,719
framework or a set of guidelines that

2541
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:15,040
people can use to define new

2542
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:18,400
types of schemas for different protocols

2543
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,040
next slide if you want to do this we're

2544
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,480
of course going to have quite a few

2545
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:23,520
challenges

2546
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,119
um ahead of us which is one of the

2547
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:26,400
reasons again i'm here today in the

2548
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:27,600
hopes that some people might have

2549
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,800
thoughts or

2550
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,639
feedback on these i'm going to highlight

2551
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,320
just three of them just just to give you

2552
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,920
an idea of what we might be talking

2553
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:34,800
about

2554
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,960
next slide so one of the things is that

2555
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,199
a simple thing to do would be to map the

2556
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:42,639
wire image that you would get

2557
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:45,440
101 to the format for example here you

2558
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,840
have a selective acknowledgement missing

2559
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,600
the packet number 16.

2560
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,600
but this doesn't necessarily reflect

2561
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,280
what the implementation is actually

2562
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:54,080
doing

2563
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,239
um it might perfectly be that packet

2564
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:58,320
number 16 isn't immediately declared as

2565
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,199
lost

2566
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:02,400
and so we need a second type of of

2567
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,679
events which you can see on the right

2568
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:04,159
side

2569
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:07,520
to actually reflect that separately

2570
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,360
if we start defining both of these types

2571
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:10,639
of events you get a

2572
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:12,800
huge amount of events first of all and

2573
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,400
it also becomes more difficult to build

2574
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,000
tooling for this because

2575
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,760
which event should you be looking for

2576
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:19,199
and which takes precedence over the

2577
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:19,679
other

2578
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,320
and so on and this is just within quick

2579
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,600
let's see if we

2580
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,600
extend this to tcp with the next slide

2581
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,600
which of course also has selective

2582
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,440
acknowledgements but in a different way

2583
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,719
because here they're in the packet

2584
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,480
header in the options field and so

2585
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:36,400
it's the exact same information but

2586
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,840
reflected in a different civilization

2587
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,480
and so we really want them to find a way

2588
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:43,040
to

2589
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,119
hopefully make this easier or we need to

2590
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:46,960
see if we really do need to reflect the

2591
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:48,880
wire image completely

2592
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,080
the second main challenge next slide is

2593
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,000
on the serialization format here

2594
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,600
we're currently using json mainly

2595
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,440
because it's flexible

2596
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:59,520
but it's also not the most performant

2597
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,560
option

2598
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,159
uh even though it is kind of usable uh

2599
01:46:04,159 --> 01:46:07,040
for example used by facebook but so also

2600
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,960
in the drafts we kind of

2601
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,400
acknowledge that we might want to use

2602
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,159
different things in jsons we have our

2603
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:13,040
own

2604
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:15,760
data type definition language there to

2605
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,199
describe the events which is what you

2606
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:19,520
can see on the right side

2607
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,280
but we would like to really move to

2608
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,440
something more officially supported by

2609
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:24,400
the ietf

2610
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:25,760
with the goal of automatically

2611
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,560
generating uh serializers or dc

2612
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,080
realizers for different

2613
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,920
programming line which is based on this

2614
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:34,400
to make deploying this easier

2615
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,639
um we would also like to get some

2616
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,480
insight into if people would use this

2617
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,600
what type of

2618
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:42,000
processing or collection pipelines they

2619
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,679
would typically want to use

2620
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:46,080
which will help guide the correct use of

2621
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:47,360
the format

2622
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,560
the final main challenge the next slide

2623
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:52,480
is of course the privacy aspects as i

2624
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,719
said in theory it's perfectly possible

2625
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:55,440
that

2626
01:46:55,440 --> 01:46:57,760
you you only log the perfectly sanitized

2627
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,840
data from the endpoints directly

2628
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:01,679
but in practice you will have use cases

2629
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,520
where you do need the ip addresses you

2630
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,400
do need

2631
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,040
the urls and that kind of stuff so what

2632
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:09,119
we envision now is to have like a

2633
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:12,480
set of standardization levels uh defined

2634
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,280
with concrete guidelines on how to hash

2635
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,719
or

2636
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:19,440
obfuscate certain fields that people can

2637
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,760
then map to individual things

2638
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,920
our hope is that if this works quite

2639
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:25,920
well and we can scrub this for most

2640
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,840
privacy sensitive information

2641
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,119
we can also start to think about

2642
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,040
actually actively sharing

2643
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:33,760
um full qlik data sets or individual cue

2644
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,639
logs

2645
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:37,760
for additional troubleshooting which of

2646
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:38,320
course

2647
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,040
leads to a whole bunch of new issues

2648
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:42,960
that might be interesting to discuss

2649
01:47:42,960 --> 01:47:46,960
so a final slide to summarize

2650
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,280
we hope that eventually maybe qlor can

2651
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,239
grow into

2652
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,960
a separate working group if it shows

2653
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,920
that it can be done

2654
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,600
if it can be done in a protocol agnostic

2655
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,440
fashion which at this point isn't even

2656
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,800
clear yet

2657
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,400
and that that new working group will

2658
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,440
help their protocols to adopt

2659
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,320
for now we're starting this in the quick

2660
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,760
working group mainly because

2661
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,480
practical and historical considerations

2662
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,920
so if you have any interest in this

2663
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,760
please come and join us there

2664
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,320
in the next couple of months or join us

2665
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,480
on the separate github and the separate

2666
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:19,360
mailing lists

2667
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:21,520
and of course i would like to listen to

2668
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,199
your questions and your feedback now as

2669
01:48:23,199 --> 01:48:23,679
well

2670
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:26,639
so thanks and i see an ad in the queue

2671
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,880
martin go ahead

2672
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,960
yes thanks robin uh just to just be

2673
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,119
crystal clear about the

2674
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,639
the action items i think come out of

2675
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:36,320
this as you know this court group is

2676
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,320
basically a community of components for

2677
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,760
a bunch of protocols

2678
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,639
um i would first of all encourage all of

2679
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:44,239
you to think about the applicability of

2680
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:45,440
this your protocol particularly if it

2681
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,440
runs over some sort of crypto like scp

2682
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:49,600
over dtls or what have you

2683
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,560
uh secondly um if you think about how to

2684
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,080
apply this to your protocols

2685
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,920
you may have some input into the main

2686
01:48:55,920 --> 01:48:57,360
schema and

2687
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,520
um number one you'll probably have to

2688
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,199
come to quick to participate in that

2689
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:02,159
discussion

2690
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:05,440
but if if we see a lot of immediate

2691
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,840
interest in applying this to more

2692
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,040
protocols

2693
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,639
we might take that and bring it to

2694
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,080
another venue

2695
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:13,360
for the core schema not the quick

2696
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:15,840
specific events but but the core schema

2697
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,920
so um that would be very useful input

2698
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:19,440
quickly if there's a lot of

2699
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,520
of immediate interest in this but we're

2700
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,800
not going to wait forever because we

2701
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:23,840
want to move this forward

2702
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,199
and quick as a venue where there's

2703
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:26,960
obviously is an interest of course that

2704
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,639
is a follow-on um

2705
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:30,560
you could do your own draft in whatever

2706
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,000
working group is appropriate

2707
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
uh this one for a bunch of protocols

2708
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,199
obviously

2709
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:37,199
using the base schema and then applying

2710
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:38,800
the events relative to your protocol so

2711
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:39,599
i encourage

2712
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,000
um really a lot of people here to start

2713
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,280
thinking about this

2714
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,960
and and seeing if there's seeing

2715
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,639
if they're if they can start thinking

2716
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:50,239
about how to reply and where

2717
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:51,920
and what they need to do in relatively

2718
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,800
short order thanks

2719
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,800
okay phil go ahead and then we're going

2720
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,080
to close we're going to close the mic

2721
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,840
lines move on

2722
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,360
yeah i was just going to quickly say

2723
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,360
that i think that keeping it in quick

2724
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:04,400
for the time being

2725
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,320
is a good thing and if we spin it out to

2726
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:09,280
a working group

2727
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,679
we might want to look a bit further and

2728
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:12,560
look into

2729
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,679
how you actually manage the

2730
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,880
quick server not just the

2731
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,760
output but how you apply feedback so i

2732
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,040
think it probably

2733
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,199
is bestest place in part in a different

2734
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,880
context but not one that we should be

2735
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:29,599
looking at now

2736
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,360
okay and with that thank you very much

2737
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,440
and uh we're gonna move on to

2738
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,639
uh last uh one of the session let me

2739
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:43,679
make sure

2740
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,599
oh boy make sure i click in the right

2741
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:47,040
place and we'll get the right material

2742
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,199
up

2743
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,480
jonathan how do you want to handle this

2744
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:53,840
do you want to go through the slides or

2745
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,760
do you want to pick up where map rg left

2746
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,920
off

2747
01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:02,560
um i think

2748
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:05,119
we just pick up where we left off if

2749
01:51:05,119 --> 01:51:06,560
anyone has questions

2750
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,400
we should um try to answer those

2751
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:14,800
and then go on to a particular slide

2752
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:16,880
is it pick a slide i want to put up uh

2753
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,719
to do that

2754
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:22,719
well it's a question of what people have

2755
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:25,599
questions about

2756
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:31,759
i have a different slide deck for for my

2757
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:35,840
talk

2758
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:44,960
so so jonathan peter i wondered

2759
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,320
how much of the data you've gathered

2760
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,599
is for would be

2761
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:53,599
applicable to other networks how

2762
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:55,440
transferable are the results you have

2763
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:56,239
here

2764
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:58,960
to other network deployments do we need

2765
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:00,800
more data have we got enough

2766
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:04,320
how big are the data sets really

2767
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:08,000
well the um

2768
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:15,520
obviously this is only one vantage point

2769
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,719
more data

2770
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:20,159
would be nice from other vantage points

2771
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:24,560
and so we have a script

2772
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:28,400
that can probably be adapted to other

2773
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:30,320
vantage points to collect the same sort

2774
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,880
of data

2775
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:38,480
peace knows better more more about the

2776
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,840
script

2777
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,679
is the script available is it something

2778
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:50,960
we can just use

2779
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,000
by the way so data is wonderful and it's

2780
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,440
really good to see data

2781
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,840
peter yes it is there is a there is a

2782
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:58,880
link to the repo

2783
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,719
and it's just a script that can run on

2784
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:02,880
any any linux router we used it up to a

2785
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,000
slash 16

2786
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,800
subnet but there's 800 some odd ips i'm

2787
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,520
not sure

2788
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,119
how far it can scale but certainly

2789
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:10,800
beyond this

2790
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,119
um but yeah we need to collect more data

2791
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:14,719
this this was collected over

2792
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:17,679
a fairly long time three weeks but 800

2793
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:19,440
some ips isn't

2794
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,599
you know it is a relatively small

2795
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,239
installation

2796
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:27,199
and probably the unique thing here is

2797
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,639
that we have

2798
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,199
um a distinction between parts where we

2799
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:33,520
know there's an aqm

2800
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,239
and a larger number of parts where we

2801
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:38,840
know that there isn't an aqm within the

2802
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,840
isp

2803
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,440
okay if there aren't any more questions

2804
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:52,560
perhaps i should go on

2805
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,719
to my talk okay

2806
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:59,840
i don't think those slot ah all right

2807
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,599
we'll let you share the screen you saw

2808
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:03,440
the guidance i sent you

2809
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:06,960
on uh what to try to cover

2810
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,560
okay um oh hang on i have to stop

2811
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,639
sharing my screen in order to get your

2812
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:15,920
allow you to share there we go

2813
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,520
okay and then i will

2814
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:23,440
switch this over to to some extent this

2815
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:26,400
is a warm-up for the fun we're going to

2816
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,800
have on wednesday

2817
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:33,040
oh i'm sure here it is

2818
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:39,040
okay so i'm jonathan morton and i'm here

2819
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:40,800
to talk about the implications

2820
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,639
of some measurements that my colleague

2821
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:44,800
pete heist talked about in the map rg

2822
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:45,360
session

2823
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:48,239
a little while ago first i think i need

2824
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:51,920
to lay out some background principles

2825
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,400
as engineers we must be aware of the

2826
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:57,599
risks associated with anything we create

2827
01:54:57,599 --> 01:54:59,440
and aerospace engineers must take this

2828
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,360
extra seriously as they deal in

2829
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,199
safety of life risks and they have

2830
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:04,880
developed a model

2831
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,599
for this the internet engineers have it

2832
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:08,639
relatively easy

2833
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:10,400
as the internet offers a best effort

2834
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,400
service which is not intended for

2835
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,480
applications where safety of life is at

2836
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,679
stake

2837
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:17,440
the worst effects are therefore mostly

2838
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,920
economic in nature

2839
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,840
we quantify a particular risk as the

2840
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,679
product of the likelihood or frequency

2841
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:24,880
that it occurs

2842
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,639
by the severity of the expected

2843
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:28,159
consequences

2844
01:55:28,159 --> 01:55:29,920
this means that equivalent risks might

2845
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,520
have different availabilities

2846
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,119
balanced by inversely differing

2847
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:34,960
likelihoods

2848
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:36,400
the question of how much risk is

2849
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,400
acceptable depends on who incurs the

2850
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,199
consequences

2851
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,360
in the lab we can deliberately induce a

2852
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,199
particular failure mode and observe the

2853
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:46,400
consequences

2854
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:48,480
and thereby establish the severity of a

2855
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,679
risk

2856
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,599
but determine the likelihood we must

2857
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:53,199
look at the real world we'll see how

2858
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:54,880
often these circumstances

2859
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,880
likely to trigger that failure mode will

2860
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,719
arise

2861
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:00,960
now i'm not going to apply the aerospace

2862
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,719
risk model to the internet

2863
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:06,480
that would be absurd but if for example

2864
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:08,480
a systemic congestion collapse event

2865
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:09,520
occurred

2866
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,760
or the root dns surface or went down at

2867
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,080
once that would be a catastrophic level

2868
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:17,440
event in internet terms and that's why

2869
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,199
those servers are managed by a decidedly

2870
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:21,280
paranoid and very international group of

2871
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,360
trustees

2872
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,520
at the opposite end of the scale a

2873
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:27,199
single packet loss is something that

2874
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:29,040
internet protocols can usually recover

2875
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,719
from very quickly

2876
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:33,679
so would be classed as trivial it's

2877
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:35,119
still desirable to minimize

2878
01:56:35,119 --> 01:56:37,440
such things but they can be tolerated

2879
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:42,000
pretty well up to a point

2880
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,599
haven't had a systemic congestion

2881
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:46,080
collapse since the 1980s

2882
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,000
because effective congestion control is

2883
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
required by current internet standards

2884
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,880
as published in rfcs

2885
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:54,639
serious radio events do occur

2886
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:56,320
occasionally and we hear about them in

2887
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:57,679
the news

2888
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,199
sometimes there's a tech best but

2889
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:01,040
sometimes the mainstream first picks it

2890
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,119
up as well

2891
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:04,719
for the most part we are concerned with

2892
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:07,599
avoiding major category events by design

2893
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:09,440
and reducing the prevalence of minor

2894
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,839
events

2895
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:16,239
the tolerable level of risk is strongly

2896
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,239
influenced by exactly who it is that

2897
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:20,400
incurs the risk

2898
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,760
if you're actually involved in the

2899
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:24,239
activity generating the risk then you

2900
01:57:24,239 --> 01:57:25,599
know what to expect

2901
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:27,360
and you have an easy way to stop the

2902
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,679
activity or to direct it away from

2903
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:30,719
yourself

2904
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:32,800
perhaps even subconsciously avoiding

2905
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,920
other activities

2906
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,840
which you expect will interact badly

2907
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:38,080
with it

2908
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,880
an interested observer might not know so

2909
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,960
much of the details of what's going on

2910
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:46,159
but is at least paying attention

2911
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:48,080
you might guess there's a novel

2912
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:50,400
disruption event that you experience

2913
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:51,920
might be linked to this particular

2914
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:54,400
activity and be able to inquire into

2915
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,840
whether that is true

2916
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,639
and indirectly cause the activity to

2917
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:01,599
stop if necessary

2918
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:04,000
but an innocent bystander might be

2919
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,360
affected by the risk

2920
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:08,400
but have no idea of its existence they

2921
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:08,880
would have

2922
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,000
no way to troubleshoot it no contact

2923
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:12,800
point

2924
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:16,239
to have the activities shut down

2925
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:17,920
so clearly the level of risk that

2926
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,159
innocent bystanders may incur

2927
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:22,000
is much less than for the other two

2928
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,920
categories

2929
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:26,639
in short we must avoid externalizing the

2930
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:29,040
risk

2931
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,719
in previous sessions we have documented

2932
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:33,840
lab tests

2933
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,159
that mostly exercise one easily

2934
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:37,520
predictable failure mode

2935
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,599
of l4s namely that it routinely squashes

2936
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:42,800
conventional tcp

2937
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,199
traffic that competes with it whether

2938
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:48,080
easy and capable or not

2939
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:50,400
in the same conventional aqm instance at

2940
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:52,480
a bottleneck

2941
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:55,280
this is a serious impairment of an

2942
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:56,239
entire

2943
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:59,440
rather widespread class of traffic

2944
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:03,839
so it falls into a major category event

2945
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:05,760
there has been some disputes from the

2946
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,360
l4s team over how

2947
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,719
likely or frequent such conditions are

2948
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:12,719
at first the focus was on single queue

2949
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:15,440
aqms with ecn enabled

2950
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,920
which appear to be uncommon compared to

2951
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,040
fluidware aqms

2952
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,960
but then we realize that flow aware

2953
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,080
mechanisms

2954
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,960
are defeated by encrypted tunnels and

2955
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,040
that l4s and conventional traffic can

2956
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:30,560
share the tunnel

2957
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,560
and thus be indistinguishable by a flow

2958
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:34,480
aware aqm

2959
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:39,199
in particular the ubiquitous fq codel

2960
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,920
just as a reminder of how much calm is

2961
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,599
caused

2962
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:48,800
a single l4s flow represented by tcp

2963
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,760
prague forces a competing cubic flow to

2964
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:52,480
collapse

2965
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:54,960
to less than a tenth of the fair share

2966
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,520
rate

2967
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,040
of our standard link that's for long

2968
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,040
running flows

2969
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,520
but even on short flows such as a crude

2970
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:05,840
simulation of web traffic

2971
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:08,239
flow completion time is quadrupled with

2972
02:00:08,239 --> 02:00:10,080
tcp plug background

2973
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,840
relative to an equivalent cubic

2974
02:00:11,840 --> 02:00:13,599
background

2975
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:15,280
we'll be happy to discuss the specifics

2976
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,119
of this test offline or

2977
02:00:17,119 --> 02:00:20,320
in the questions afterwards

2978
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:22,960
using the new hum metric introduced at

2979
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,800
the last

2980
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:29,159
ietf meeting we see upwards of

2981
02:00:29,159 --> 02:00:34,000
0.85 harm inflicted by prague on cubic

2982
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,880
where cubic inflicts only about 0.5 harm

2983
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,520
on itself

2984
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:43,119
0.85 is a nasty figure

2985
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,599
now if this never almost never occurred

2986
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:46,800
in practice then

2987
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,920
perhaps it could be overlooked

2988
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,520
the only way to find that out is to look

2989
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:56,159
so we collected some anonymized data

2990
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:57,920
from a small isp

2991
02:00:57,920 --> 02:00:59,840
and looked carefully for firm evidence

2992
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,440
of acn and aqm

2993
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:04,639
activity we were able to distinguish

2994
02:01:04,639 --> 02:01:05,360
activity

2995
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,480
on tcp flows that negotiated ecn support

2996
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:11,199
from those who did not and look for ce

2997
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:12,880
marks and ece flags

2998
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:15,199
which are usually a pretty clear sign of

2999
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:16,320
a neg aqm

3000
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:20,239
on the path only a small proportion of

3001
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:23,679
tcp flows negotiated ecn support

3002
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,360
but they were spread over a large

3003
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,800
fraction of the isps subscribers

3004
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:30,400
this seems consistent with many

3005
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:32,000
subscribers having both apple

3006
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,840
and non-apple devices in the same

3007
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:35,199
household and

3008
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:37,360
mostly using the non-apple ones for

3009
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:39,760
internet traffic

3010
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:42,639
we can only easily observe aqms on ect

3011
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:44,080
flows

3012
02:01:44,080 --> 02:01:45,920
that drive an aqm bottleneck to

3013
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:48,080
saturation

3014
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:51,920
so this small proportion of ect flows

3015
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:55,360
was less than ideal but we were able to

3016
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:57,520
observe aqm activity

3017
02:01:57,520 --> 02:01:59,840
on sixty percent of parts it had a known

3018
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:00,800
aqm

3019
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:04,719
internal to the isp and on ten percent

3020
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:07,599
of parts that did not

3021
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:10,320
this latter proportion is clearly higher

3022
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:10,880
than the

3023
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,800
five percent threshold i recall was

3024
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,840
suggested on the list some time ago

3025
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:17,679
it's also clearly higher than the rate

3026
02:02:17,679 --> 02:02:22,400
of ecn negotiation by client endpoints

3027
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:26,480
so here is a serious question fating

3028
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,199
facing this working group

3029
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:32,400
given a major severity risk that could

3030
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,719
show up on 10 percent of powers

3031
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,760
at least several times a month

3032
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:40,080
is that acceptable to inflict on

3033
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:44,000
innocent bystanders in particular

3034
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,639
i would say not but i'm only one voice

3035
02:02:48,639 --> 02:02:52,800
and let me be clear existing networks

3036
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:53,760
and their users

3037
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:56,800
are innocent bystanders they do not know

3038
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:59,599
anything whatsoever about l4s

3039
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:01,599
and most of them would not care even if

3040
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:03,920
explained

3041
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,320
this isp in particular has a very long

3042
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:08,639
equipment replacement cycle

3043
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,199
some of it dates from 15 years ago when

3044
02:03:11,199 --> 02:03:13,280
they first set up

3045
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,760
and that is one reason why only some of

3046
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:19,760
the internal powers have fq coda

3047
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,760
but even if other isps upgrade more

3048
02:03:21,760 --> 02:03:24,320
quickly their cast offs will often go to

3049
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,159
the less prosperous parts of the world

3050
02:03:26,159 --> 02:03:30,320
for a second probably much longer life

3051
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:33,080
if we started eliminating them today

3052
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:35,280
rsc3168 aqms

3053
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:39,280
would still be around for decades

3054
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:42,560
what's more a user who notices a problem

3055
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:45,760
can't evade it merely by disabling ecn

3056
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:49,920
on his own traffic not ect traffic is

3057
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:53,360
just as affected only the aqm

3058
02:03:53,360 --> 02:03:55,599
needs to support ecn to trigger the

3059
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:57,599
effect

3060
02:03:57,599 --> 02:03:59,599
the alpha west traffic could involve a

3061
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:01,679
completely different device

3062
02:04:01,679 --> 02:04:04,800
such as a game's console or set-top box

3063
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:10,480
which the user cannot reconfigure

3064
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,480
let's see okay well there's gonna be a

3065
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,920
link to the point first i'll just leave

3066
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,440
this slide up as a summary

3067
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:18,719
and ask for questions and we are

3068
02:04:18,719 --> 02:04:22,000
basically at time so i think this is a

3069
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,520
good place to stop

3070
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:26,320
we could take a very brief question now

3071
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:27,599
definitely should let bob

3072
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:29,679
in since i think he's got some comments

3073
02:04:29,679 --> 02:04:31,119
but i think a lot of this is for people

3074
02:04:31,119 --> 02:04:32,880
think about the next session

3075
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:35,840
bob go ahead

3076
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:39,679
hi there can you hear me yes yes

3077
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:42,960
yep um i

3078
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:45,360
i appreciate jonathan that you know

3079
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,880
you're trying to

3080
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:50,480
prove a point here um

3081
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:53,760
what seems fairly

3082
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:58,000
sort of um incongruous to me is that

3083
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,239
this this risk analysis that you talk

3084
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:01,040
about here

3085
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:07,840
was never done um when fq is deployed

3086
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,840
up

3087
02:05:24,159 --> 02:05:28,559
let me refer back to an earlier slide

3088
02:05:29,679 --> 02:05:34,000
so a major level a major severity

3089
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,280
harm is where the service quality is

3090
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:40,400
seriously impaired for

3091
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:44,400
for example a class of traffic

3092
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:48,159
whereas a minor level severity

3093
02:05:48,159 --> 02:05:51,040
would be a moderate sustained localized

3094
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:52,159
impact

3095
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:55,360
on service quality

3096
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:59,040
wouldn't it be reasonable to supply

3097
02:05:59,040 --> 02:05:59,679
suppose

3098
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:02,800
that the impact of

3099
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,480
um a max min

3100
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:10,000
fairness enforcement would be limited to

3101
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,679
minor

3102
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:14,639
no because that you can have any number

3103
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:16,000
of flows in a vpn

3104
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
that fq puts all into one queue and so

3105
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,280
the the no limit how much damage f

3106
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:26,480
does and then

3107
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:30,400
not looking at all and instead

3108
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:41,440
i think what we need to do is call time

3109
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:43,520
on this and take further take further

3110
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:44,079
discussion

3111
02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:46,159
of the list and it'll be an opportunity

3112
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:50,320
to dig into this further on wednesday

3113
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:55,520
okay i can get behind that

3114
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:57,599
i think that and maybe bob can

3115
02:06:57,599 --> 02:07:00,639
troubleshoot his audio on in the process

3116
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:02,800
yeah yeah yeah bob's audience is better

3117
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:03,760
than wednesday we're gonna have we're

3118
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:05,920
gonna have serious problems so i hope

3119
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:09,119
you figure out what's going on there

3120
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:16,719
um yeah um

3121
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:18,719
do i repeat it all i i don't know i i

3122
02:07:18,719 --> 02:07:20,239
was just i was just saying i'd like to

3123
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:21,199
see

3124
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:24,159
i mean the analysis of how much of the

3125
02:07:24,159 --> 02:07:25,119
of the problem

3126
02:07:25,119 --> 02:07:27,440
was originally there or it is originally

3127
02:07:27,440 --> 02:07:30,079
because therefore

3128
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:40,719
um your audio is going downhill again

3129
02:07:40,719 --> 02:07:42,480
i think you're asked for how much of the

3130
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:43,760
problem is exists

3131
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:46,480
out completely absent l4s and i think on

3132
02:07:46,480 --> 02:07:48,000
that note we probably ought to wind up

3133
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:55,840
the meaning

3134
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:01,280
all right i believe we're done

3135
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,239
thank you all very much uh we'll see you

3136
02:08:04,239 --> 02:08:07,199
all on wednesday

3137
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:23,839
all right see you then
