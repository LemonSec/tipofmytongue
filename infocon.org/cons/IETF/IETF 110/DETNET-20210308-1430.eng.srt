change slides there we go as we are

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,840
at the ietf we have sort of ground rules

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,960
governing

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,439
the way we interact and also the

24
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,640
information

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
uh how we share the information we say

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,320
in these working groups

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,799
basically anything you say here becomes

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,680
part of our

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
uh record if you're not familiar with

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,960
the notewell

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,920
i strongly suggest that you go first

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
familiarize yourself

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,200
with it

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,200
[Music]

with me on meat echo so you figured out

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,400
the first part

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
um the we're using

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,799
uh the integrated jabber and chat and

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,520
we'll try to

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,119
uh watch that and channel any of the um

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,600

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
we'll try to uh track that and

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,520
repeat the comments i already mentioned

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,159
that we're taking notes through codingmd

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,199
and the material is posted at the

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,840
various

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
um uh links

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,360
one thing i'd like to comment is um

54
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,440
tools the tools website seems to be

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:17,920
having

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,239
a whole slew of issues and um if you run

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,239
into problems there

58
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,920
go you know check out for the same

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,280
information on data tracker

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,400
so we have two plus one sessions

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,200
uh at this meeting the first session

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
we're in now is in a one-hour session

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
we're going to really focus

64
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
on um reviewing where we are on our yang

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
document which we hope to move to last

66
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
call the objective of

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,599
covering that now is to really make sure

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,800
the working group has a good

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
understanding of what's there

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,159
and to facilitate accelerate the last

71
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,959
call process

72
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,519
our second session is tomorrow another

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
one hour session

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
and it's sort of a normal working group

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,319
meeting where we'll cover

76
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,879
the drafts that are on the agenda the

77
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,760
third session

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,319
is a joint meeting with pals mpls in

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,280
spring

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400
and is really going to be focused on oem

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
and mpls and the control word

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,959
consistency across the different groups

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,560
that are using

84
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,000
that base technology

85
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,720
um so i i guess i should have made the

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,840
comment about yang

87
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
on this slide so today we have the the

88
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,200
yang walkthrough

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,519
and you can see the uh agenda that's

90
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,480
laid out

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,840
um for tomorrow

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
we in this working group we follow an

93
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,120
ipr disclosure process

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,239
that is we require

95
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,040
ipr just statements from authors and

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
contributors at two points the first

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,720
point is when we adopt the working group

98
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,519
document

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,720
and the second one is before we submit

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
to the isg so that's part of our last

101
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,120
call

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,680
process working with last call process

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
those are required steps and we require

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,199
responses from all listed authors and

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
contributors before moving to the next

106
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
step

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
we are also introducing a new step this

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,639
is not a requirement but a request

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,320
and specifically that we ask that if you

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,199
are added

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,000
to a working group document as either a

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,960
contributor

113
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
or as an author that you make a

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
statement at that time

115
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,560
now you'll be required to make a

116
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
statement at last call

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
but we since you didn't participate in

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,080
the

119
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
initial ipr call process during

120
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
adoption we ask that you make a

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
disclosure at the time of being added

122
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
that's just for working group documents

123
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,479
so we've had a a good set of documents

124
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,280
published it's always good to to see

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
publications and new rfcs we thank all

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,919
those who contributed to this and you

127
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,160
know

128
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,400
all that's pretty much everyone in the

129
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
the working group because

130
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,160
um even if you just make a single

131
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,840
comment that's a contribution and we

132
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,120
appreciate that

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,360
we also have a good set of documents in

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,320
the rfc editor queue

135
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
together between the published and

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
what's in the rfc editor queue

137
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,960
that makes up the core data plane

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,919
of debt net and represents a really

139
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,520
significant achievement

140
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,960
so that's going to be that's great that

141
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
that comes out from our initial set of

142
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,199
uh of deliverables the main item that

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,080
was is left

144
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
is the yang document and as you heard

145
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,199
earlier

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
we are preparing to last call that

147
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
document

148
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
as well

149
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,400
we have the informational bounded

150
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,479
latency document that's post

151
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,039
working group last call we have the yang

152
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,800
document headed to the last call

153
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,520
and we have several documents that are

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:07,840
not

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
on the agenda the we do consider these

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,319
fairly important documents as well so we

157
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,560
look to them

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
progressing as rapidly as possible

159
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,520
we have one document that you're going

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
to hear about later that's being

161
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
requested for

162
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,199
working group adoption

163
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
um at this point we're all used to

164
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,919
working remote

165
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,039
probably a little tired of it and

166
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,759
looking forward to uh

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
hopefully not too long being in person

168
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,680
but until then

169
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
uh we encourage everyone to continue

170
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,360
using the list discussion there is is

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,160
really

172
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,720
the primary place for resolving issues

173
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,360
we can also schedule working group

174
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,240
meetings

175
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,840
and then less formal working meetings

176
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,240
i believe there are going to be two less

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
formal meetings spinning up they're the

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
yang

179
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
there's a weekly yang call that's been

180
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
going on i think that one is going to

181
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
wind down

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,240
and we're expecting that there's going

183
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
to be one on control plane and one on

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,120
oam

185
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,039
those group those meetings are open to

186
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
everyone uh they're less formal so

187
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,840
they're not

188
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,800
uh minuted but they were the what goes

189
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,599
on there

190
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,319
um will translate to updates to drafts

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,680
and those drafts will be brought to the

192
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
working group and

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,919
the changes will be brought to the

194
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,319
working group for uh to ensure that we

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,840
have consensus from the working group

196
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,599
but again those are going to be open to

197
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,960
all and uh

198
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
look stay tuned to the list for the

199
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,080
announcement of

200
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
those meetings and with that

201
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
um we're done with the intro

202
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,919
and we're going to go on to the

203
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,199
configuration

204
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
sorry the yang model uh this is uh

205
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
the um is going to be the the

206
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
rest of this session and i believe don

207
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,720
you said you're going to be

208
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,759
um presenting this just make sure to say

209
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,240
next

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,560
and so i noticed one already done

211
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
sure you hear me okay

212
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,520
yes

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,639
yes i can hear you fine okay thanks

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,319
um so this is the yang model um

215
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,440
so um i'll just state that i'm not aware

216
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
of any ipr

217
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
because i joined the draft at some

218
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,958
period

219
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,440
after it was adopted as a working group

220
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,039
document

221
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
so the the list of authors on there um

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,040
and we've uh like we would mention we've

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,600
had

224
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
uh weekly meetings uh pretty much

225
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,040
throughout the year um um

226
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
and if you go to the next chart

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,480
so we think the document's at a point

228
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
where we're ready for last group call

229
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,440
we've we've had uh

230
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,519
in other updates we've always had items

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,120
that we had to do

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,800
um we've uh we're going to present the

233
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
summary today

234
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,160
and uh as always uh please review and

235
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
comment so one of the things i'm gonna

236
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
do today is try and help you

237
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,640
understand how we how we approach the

238
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,440
document

239
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
and and help you perhaps get uh any

240
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,160
review comments in

241
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,120
next chart please

242
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,240
comment on your prior slide the the

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
title of the prior

244
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,080
slide said um configuration

245
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,160
my memory is is the current model covers

246
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
both uh configuration

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,279
and operational state yes um

248
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,120
yes so there is uh and the uh

249
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
the name of the model uh was called the

250
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,839
config model and then we changed it just

251
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,240
to

252
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,040
detonate yang

253
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,320
so there there is both status

254
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
information

255
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
and configuration information in there

256
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
um

257
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,120
so because this uh this model is is

258
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,399
is a primarily configuring the data

259
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,440
plane though

260
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
the majority of the items are

261
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,240
configuration items

262
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,079
so uh the history there um

263
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
is as we went through the various

264
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,600
versions

265
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
so we're on uh version uh 10 and 11 are

266
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,160
virtually the same

267
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,839
except that um somewhere along the lines

268
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,279
i guess the

269
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,959
uh i i didn't catch that the

270
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,079
was there was additional uh yang checks

271
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,640
that went in so when i submitted 10

272
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,240
i found that there's a dash itf

273
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
flag i hadn't been using on the yang

274
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
the pyang tool and that turned up a

275
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
bunch of other

276
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,120
um basically comments on

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,079
uh descriptions that were missing so we

278
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,560
edited that and we have a clean

279
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
yang model

280
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,800
next chart please

281
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,560
so the det-net architecture um

282
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,519
is is published in this diagram is in

283
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,000
there

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,160
in ascii text and um

285
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,560
as we were as we were trying to present

286
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
this i realized that

287
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
if you if you think about um the the

288
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,959
data plane drafts

289
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,440
they go right across this architecture

290
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
kind of horizontally

291
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,839
and the same thing for the flow model it

292
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,880
talks about

293
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,680
uh flows that are that are dealt with

294
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,279
the attributes that are dealt with them

295
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,800
horizontally

296
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
but the yang model is actually kind of

297
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,200
operating

298
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,600
vertically in the stack on each on one

299
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,639
of these devices

300
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
so um depending upon where you

301
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,079
are you're using different attributes in

302
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,440
the yang model

303
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,360
and that's what we're covering so we're

304
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,639
covering

305
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,680
the um

306
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,959
the the data planes defined in the ietf

307
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
and the cases in the ietf

308
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,440
and there's corresponding yang that we

309
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,079
haven't

310
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,480
really looked at in this that would be

311
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
for tsn that's being

312
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,000
um in the ieee 802.1

313
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
working group so we're we've been

314
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
concentrating on

315
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
what we documented and trying to stick

316
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,160
to the data planes etc

317
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,600
that are in there okay

318
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
next chart

319
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,399
so this chart we've seen before um and

320
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,600
the the flow model is is a functional

321
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,079
model

322
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,200
that talks about the flows and

323
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,320
it it talks about application flows

324
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,000
the detonate flows um and the service

325
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
and we've translated that into the

326
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,639
various pieces in the architecture

327
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,200
the the only thing that's happened in

328
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,160
the

329
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,959
last little while in the past few months

330
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,320
there were some updating of some

331
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,120
fields in there and we have tracked

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
those changes

333
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,839
we believe in the the yang model to date

334
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,360
um so next chart please

335
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
so like i said um

336
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,120
the net yang model

337
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
is it's hierarchical it contains

338
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,959
aggregation

339
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,680
it's location dependent we saw on the

340
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,480
chart

341
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,399
where you are if you're an endpoint

342
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,080
transient or relay

00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,279
[Music]

344
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,880
the the flows are aggregate flows

345
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,040
and we capture the flow attributes and

346
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
the status information that's in there

347
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,440
we tried to build it as much as possible

348
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,760
on reusable pieces from

349
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
other yang models were out there for ip

350
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
and mpls

351
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,600
um it's configuration centric

352
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,399
because it it it was it's a model that

353
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,880
would be used with something like

354
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,240
an sdn control plane we're not

355
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
talking about um

356
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,199
configuration for uh internal control

357
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,240
planes

358
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,880
and it includes some operational

359
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,079
attributes

360
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,639
the detonate flow model i'm not really

361
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,079
summarizing it that well

362
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
but the differences are that it it's

363
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,120
functional

364
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
and it's concerned concerned with the

365
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
attributes and characteristics of flows

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
and it covers configuration aspects and

367
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,720
operational aspects so that's just kind

368
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,680
of

369
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
um when i came into this one of

370
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,800
my tasks was to try to align with the

371
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,760
flow model

372
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,600
and we think we've done that but there

373
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,800
are differences as i've mentioned out

374
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
okay next chart please

375
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,399
so the methodology we use we had a large

376
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,680
model

377
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,680
and we had many permutations

378
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,759
and what we found at least i found

379
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
it was hard to validate by simple

380
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
inspection

381
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
and we needed to enumerate the various

382
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
cases

383
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,600
so we went through trying to align the

384
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,560
terminology with the documents

385
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,560
um and

386
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,959
trying to reuse the uh the pieces that

387
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,320
were out there

388
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,360
and what we found worked was uh

389
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,680
considering configuration cases so we

390
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
started off

391
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,000
uh once we had revamped the model we we

392
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,160
started off with a simple

393
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,279
configuration case of

394
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,160
a flow starting in an application going

395
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,839
through the service sublayer going

396
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,560
through the

397
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,920
forwarding sub-layer and then

398
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,720
um we used yanglint to test and document

399
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
that case so by providing

400
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,240
an xml file

401
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,639
that had had the configuration aspects

402
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
for the particular case we were looking

403
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,199
at

404
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,120
we could go through and validate that

405
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,959
against the schema

406
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,160
and it gives you a clearer picture

407
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
and because

408
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,279
we we had discussions back and forth

409
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,519
we've we've provided diagrams for the

410
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,560
cases

411
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,959
so we've got like i said we started off

412
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,920
with the basic

413
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,759
single detonate flow

414
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,959
endpoint for unidirectional and

415
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,959
bi-directional cases

416
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,359
and then we started uh working our way

417
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,559
through the different cases

418
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,000
transit nodes and simple aggregation

419
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,160
and aggregation at several places

420
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,839
next chart please

421
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,160
so we've seen this chart before and it's

422
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,559
kind of a map of what we've done

423
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,640
so we have um at the top there we've

424
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,039
we've got ip and an ip flowing

425
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,320
flow coming in could be ip could be

426
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
ip all the way through that net it could

427
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,919
be application

428
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
service sub layer or forwarding sub

429
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,039
layer

430
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,840
and it could it could come all the way

431
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,240
through or

432
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,000
ip could be encapsulated at mpls at the

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
service sub-layer

434
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
and it could continue its way on mpls

435
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
and then of course

436
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,200
return to ip at the outside or

437
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,280
it could it could be that um

438
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
i ip went went over mpls and then that

439
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,840
went over

440
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,200
um a an ip tunnel

441
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,080
we we don't have everything for ip

442
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,120
tunnels in there

443
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
and ip and ip tunnels because we don't

444
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,559
have any

445
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,240
at this point we don't have any detonate

446
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,720
drafts that specify those

447
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,840
um so

448
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,400
mpls you could come in at this mpls and

449
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,200
you could just

450
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,000
pass through as mpls all the way

451
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
ethernet

452
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
we have the model where ethernet comes

453
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,440
in and we can

454
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
look at it as at an interface and we can

455
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,880
filter it

456
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
somewhat and then we would pass it on

457
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
over

458
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,240
mpls is the typical case today

459
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,559
um but it could go in an ip and ip

460
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,679
tunnel in the future as well

461
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,720
so we've we've highlighted the um

462
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
the documents that we we've covered

463
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,280
and um

464
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,919
for for this for this bass draft this is

465
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,919
what we're thinking is necessary to

466
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,960
cover

467
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,280
the the question we have is is is there

468
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,799
anything we think we should be

469
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,720
doing for the ip and ip tunnels um

470
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,360
that's that's the only piece we we we

471
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,440
think that it's a complete document as

472
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
it is but we wanted to

473
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,480
highlight that at that point

474
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,639
uh next chart

475
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,360
want to take comments as you go do you

476
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,160
want to take comments at the end

477
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,039
um well if if there's any comments on

478
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,960
that particular piece right now it would

479
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,000
be

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,559
worthwhile

481
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,679
it's giving people a moment to get into

482
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,919
queue

483
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
i guess um my question i don't know

484
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,360
what which hat i'm wearing is where is

485
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,559
ip and ip

486
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,679
tunnels documented that's that was our

487
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,320
issue

488
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,799
that we we didn't have good pointers to

489
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,919
it

490
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,240
for detnet now if there's something if

491
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,600
there's a document that fi

492
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,520
somebody finds somewhere else that they

493
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
think we could incorporate easily

494
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,400
we'd be happy to look at it but we were

495
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,320
we were struggling with finding

496
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,360
a good pointer to to go by so

497
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,720
i think there's your answer yeah

498
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,559
all right thanks okay uh next chart

499
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,879
please

500
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,400
so uh this is a just a

501
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
a model structure that we we have in the

502
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,640
document

503
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,799
um so we have application flows

504
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,559
um the service sub layer and the

505
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,159
forwarding sub layer

506
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,440
and then we originally had uh under each

507
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,840
we

508
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
we tried to fit in with the flow model

509
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
we tried to fit in

510
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,880
the the aspects as the model evolved we

511
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,000
basically created a traffic profile

512
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,280
that has the um the flow attributes

513
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
and it could be optionally attached to

514
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
each piece because

515
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,679
that net is hierarchical but a flow

516
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,159
an app flow and a service sub-layer flow

517
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,039
and a forwarding

518
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,919
layer flow can can go on to the next

519
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:18,640
layer

520
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
we found that there were cases that they

521
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,559
could be attached to each one

522
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,880
they they they're optional in the sense

523
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
they don't have to be there

524
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,919
um but but you could attach that

525
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,960
information to um

526
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,120
if you had app flows and then you had an

527
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
aggregation you could have

528
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,120
a traffic profile that reflected that

529
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,320
aggregation

530
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,039
at the service sub-layer for example so

531
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,000
this was the

532
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
um this is what's the the major pieces

533
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
inside the model

534
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,520
are these uh the app flow the service

535
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,280
sub layer the forwarding sub layer and

536
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
the traffic flow

537
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,080
profile the

538
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
the other thing is that we in the model

539
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,200
that we do

540
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,039
is we refer um to

541
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,039
the the um each layer with

542
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,760
uh reference pointers and they're

543
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,679
bi-directional reference pointers but

544
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,919
we've tried to make it so that

545
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,000
um you only have to configure it in one

546
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,919
direction and the other direction would

547
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:20,640
be just

548
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,960
something that you could refer to so if

549
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,720
an app flow refers to a

550
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,840
service sub layer um but you would only

551
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,360
configure it in one place

552
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,039
and the other the other one would be

553
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,679
available for viewing on the other side

554
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,840
so you you're able to see from the

555
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
outflow which service sub layer you're

556
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,480
going to

557
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
and you're able to see from the service

558
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
sub layer what app flow with

559
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,000
it supports but you only have to

560
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
configure that once

561
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,799
next chart

562
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,799
so um the model tree

563
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,840
is is in the document i i just put it

564
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,559
here

565
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,120
uh for for reference because we're gonna

566
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,760
be

567
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,200
referring to pieces inside here and

568
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,360
the the only thing you really need to

569
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,919
take away from this is when we

570
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,200
look at the models in the um

571
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,960
the yang lint where we're doing the

572
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,559
actual cases

573
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,760
we're using a subset of these models so

574
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,440
so these have all the permea

575
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,559
this has all the permutations in it

576
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,080
and a what we have here

577
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
just on the left hand side we have the

578
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,840
traffic profile

579
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
and then we have the app flows next

580
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
chart please

581
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,320
we have the service sub layer with its

582
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,640
attributes and direction

583
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,960
and next chart please

584
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
and then we have the forwarding

585
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,400
sub-layer with

586
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,320
um its attributes and directions

587
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,720
and next chart

588
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,919
okay so so

589
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,159
um at a high level that's

590
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,840
the the complete model and um

591
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
now what we're going to talk about is

592
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,919
the the various cases

593
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,960
so what we what we started here with

594
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
was um

595
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,000
simple a simple model and we started

596
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,840
with

597
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
um

598
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,679
the application flows so the diagrams

599
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,559
that we've

600
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,880
we've created to to describe this have

601
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,480
evolved over time

602
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,799
we've tried to align them one one with

603
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,760
one

604
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,720
with the examples so there is a

605
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,640
repository

606
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,600
a detonate repository that contains i

607
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,159
think the complete set of these diagrams

608
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,520
and the complete set of the

609
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,799
the test cases the

610
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,000
the only thing um that may be

611
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,080
a little bit confusing and that was one

612
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,000
of the reviews had said

613
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,760
oh you're using using ipv4 addresses all

614
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,000
over

615
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
the place and they're the same and

616
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,200
i didn't realize we had done that

617
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,039
specifically in the models and the

618
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,080
examples

619
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,320
to match these diagrams and i changed

620
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,279
some of them but

621
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,919
for this for this presentation i think

622
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,360
i've realigned them but if you're

623
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,600
looking at the draft and you say oh the

624
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,559
the addresses are different it was just

625
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,720
um

626
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,440
because uh there was a comment that you

627
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,159
should vary the addresses and

628
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,840
i foolishly followed the comment um

629
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
so in this in this diagram what we have

630
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,159
is we have two applications and that's

631
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,440
illustrated

632
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,720
we tried to use a consistent um

633
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,880
representation all the time so we've got

634
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
data that

635
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,480
two applications being aggregated in an

636
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,520
ip

637
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,640
and so the rest of the way through

638
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,880
um there's a rep there's a replication

639
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,799
function that's going on here

640
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,480
but the rest of the way through those

641
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
out those application flows are

642
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,120
basically

643
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,240
capital encapsulated in that

644
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,440
ip service layer

645
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,840
all the way through and the rest of the

646
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,120
information is

647
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
through there and if you're looking at

648
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
the configuration for this

649
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,720
you're looking at it only at one of

650
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
these points

651
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,720
you have to of course go to each node

652
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,679
and have the configuration at each point

653
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,159
we have only done the configuration that

654
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,440
selective points

655
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,159
in the diagram so that's that vertical

656
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,200
aspect that i

657
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,960
i pointed to before you really have to

658
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
look at context of what

659
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,480
node you're going on there next

660
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
chart please

661
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,279
so this is um uh

662
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,480
i think this is just the same

663
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,360
go back for one second i th this is two

664
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,000
apps

665
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,320
i think this is the same diagram just go

666
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,279
back again

667
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,919
to the to the forward sorry

668
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,880
yeah this is just another representation

669
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,919
of the same

670
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,720
diagram we just had and it's just

671
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,159
another way to show it so

672
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,480
we're basically showing the operations

673
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,399
that go on here

674
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,360
at a node the ingress node the

675
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,080
application

676
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
service and forwarding layer and then

677
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,919
again you'd have the same

678
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,960
operations on the egress and there's

679
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,120
configuration in both directions so

680
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
while this is bi-directional

681
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,159
you can configure it either as um

682
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,880
like a unidirectional configuration in

683
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,919
two ways

684
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,159
or there are capabilities in the model

685
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,000
to basically

686
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,640
um use if you're bi-directionally

687
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
congruent you could use the same

688
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,960
components in both directions but

689
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,720
there's nothing in the model that forces

690
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,200
you to

691
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,279
so it's it's a unidirectional type of

692
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,640
configuration

693
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,559
but you can support bi-directional

694
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,679
services as well

695
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,320
next chart

696
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,159
so this is another case here

697
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,240
where now we're doing um

698
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,360
uh let's see

699
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,200
make sure i get it right we've got two

700
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,520
applications coming in

701
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,240
um and we're doing the

702
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,000
yeah we have two ip applica so the

703
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,159
applications come in the data comes in

704
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,880
and it's on ip and these two ip

705
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,559
applications are being

706
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,760
aggregated at uh an mpls service layer

707
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:13,840
okay next chart

708
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,158
so this is how

709
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,520
we would we would validate a case here

710
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,159
this is case b1

711
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,279
and it says continued on there

712
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,919
no i think that's the first one but it

713
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,440
looks like it's the beginning of it

714
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,320
just clarify something on the previous

715
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,159
slide uh sorry about being

716
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,520
the unmute um so on the previous slide

717
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,120
um you the your word said that you're

718
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,039
aggregating at the service level but the

719
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,120
slide says aggregating at the forwarding

720
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
level

721
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,440
which one is it

722
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,000
did he misspeak or is the slide wrong i

723
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,840
probably misspoke

724
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,679
okay thank you so this is aggregation of

725
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
the forwarding sub layer

726
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,200
yes i think so all right thank you

727
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,440
and can you just go to the next chart

728
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,760
here it looks like we've got the charts

729
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,480
and

730
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,600
yeah so this is the actual first

731
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,480
chart and then they somehow got out or

732
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
order probably my fault

733
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,440
um so what i wanted this cover here is

734
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,919
that

735
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,200
um as much as possible we validated as

736
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,520
much as the model as we could so

737
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,720
we actually configure interfaces

738
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,159
and we're using the

739
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,480
operational view of the model

740
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,320
because we we to to get a view of what's

741
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,799
going on we have both

742
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,440
uh config false and config true

743
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,919
attributes when you're configuring

744
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,360
in yang you basically the the con

745
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
config true items are the ones that you

746
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,559
are typically configuring

747
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,799
and the config false ones are typically

748
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,240
the ones that

749
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,159
you're reading back for status

750
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,840
information

751
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,919
or you know confirmation of

752
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,519
configuration

753
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,200
and we wanted to do

754
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,840
both because we found that if you

755
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,200
just do the config items you don't quite

756
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,720
have the full picture you don't have

757
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,640
these forward and backward pointers that

758
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,519
we were

759
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,600
mentioning so we've we've gone to

760
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,880
a model where we're using the

761
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,919
operational ones and for that reason we

762
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:44,640
have to

763
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,519
fill in because the ietf models have

764
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:47,919
some

765
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,559
pieces in there we have to fill in these

766
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,440
things like

767
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,799
the operational status and the time

768
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,679
um just to satisfy the model so that's

769
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,559
why

770
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,399
there's more detail in here than there

771
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,080
needs to be you really just need to know

772
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,120
the name of the

773
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,600
the interface but because we're going to

774
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,120
use that and we have an operational view

775
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
it it will show up in this way in the

776
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,960
model

777
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,000
and then on the right hand side we have

778
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
the applications here

779
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,760
sorry oh stay there um

780
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,880
so we have the application and we have

781
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,200
the um the application's names

782
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,519
um and then we like i said we've got

783
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,600
these pointers the reference pointer

784
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,320
so the outgoing service uh we've called

785
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,919
it service sub layer dash

786
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,200
one and the traffic profile that it's

787
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,559
associated with and then you see some

788
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,840
status information

789
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,240
so we said it's all working and ready

790
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,279
but that's just

791
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,519
data that we're punching into the model

792
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,880
and the interface

793
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,600
so the interface like i said to get that

794
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
interface and reference it in

795
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,600
language is actually check checking

796
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,559
these so if i was to put ethernet

797
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,480
interface five in it would say it

798
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,000
doesn't exist

799
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,399
um so so that aspect of the model is

800
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,840
being checked in here

801
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,679
but it also gives you the nice flow

802
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,519
through of what's going on here so we

803
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,679
have the ip flow and the addresses in

804
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,559
here

805
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,799
and then the same for application two so

806
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,320
now i believe you have to go back one

807
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,679
chart to get to the

808
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,440
second chart uh

809
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,120
yes so here's the the traffic profiles

810
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
follow next

811
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,679
and we have the profile and then we have

812
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,200
um the uh in this one we have traffic

813
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,720
requirements

814
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,399
um there are um

815
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,880
in in the third one down we have some

816
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
flow spec

817
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,519
capabilities you can populate it with

818
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,600
the traffic requirements or the flow

819
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,039
spec or both

820
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,000
or neither and then we have as i

821
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,120
mentioned before

822
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,120
we have pointers to the applications

823
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,519
that it's re that are members of this

824
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,679
and then in the application we saw that

825
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,918
we had a pointer to the traffic profile

826
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,040
and then on the right hand side we have

827
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,800
the service sub-layer

828
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,359
so we have again the service of layer

829
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,560
name

830
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,399
and if it has a traffic profile

831
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,079
and the operation type that it's doing

832
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,440
and then it has the um

833
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,918
application flow that's that that it

834
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,719
that's uh

835
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,800
that's in there and then it has the

836
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,239
outgoing type

837
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,239
um where it's going to the forwarding

838
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,359
sub-layer

839
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,199
and it's it's uh the index and any

840
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,119
labels that we've got on there

841
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,560
and these labels should match the

842
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
diagram i'm not 100

843
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,320
sure they do but we did check them and

844
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,000
we think they do

845
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,239
and and then it has the reference for

846
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,200
the um

847
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,960
the forwarding layer so if we skip

848
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,320
two charts forward

849
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,480
so there's the the the other service sub

850
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,920
layer and then we're on to the

851
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,440
forwarding sub layer

852
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,240
so we have the forwarding sub layer and

853
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,880
again

854
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,800
just like you saw with the other ones

855
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
the name the traffic profile

856
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,160
the operation type the

857
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,680
the service sub layers that are

858
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,200
aggregated in this we

859
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,800
we can see that and then the outgoing

860
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
interface

861
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,400
it's going to one of these interfaces

862
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,440
and the labels that go on there

863
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,960
so if you understand this

864
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,920
you basically understand how the

865
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,359
configuration model

866
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,040
works for a particular case

867
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,960
and the rest of the

868
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,000
um presentation i we we didn't go

869
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
through this for every one of these but

870
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
these like i said are published on

871
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,240
github

872
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,880
uh we can publish a pointer to that if

873
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,160
you want

874
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,400
um they just to help you understand the

875
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,680
model so if you're

876
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,320
really a good at yang expert you'll just

877
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
look at the yang model and know what's

878
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,520
going on

879
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
if you want to understand how it's used

880
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,200
in configuration

881
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,560
these are the things that you would go

882
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,040
and look at look at

883
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,160
so i can pause there for any questions

884
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,800
um this is the diagram that goes with

885
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,599
that

886
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,960
so like i say we've we've we've done

887
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,200
the the validation and then we've done

888
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,040
the day diagram for

889
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,440
all of these uh cases and i'd like to

890
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,640
thank

891
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,720
um you know the members that were

892
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,200
participating in the weekly meetings for

893
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
for going through all these because it

894
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,960
it takes a while to go all

895
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,040
through all these and get that working

896
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,880
but i think it

897
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,359
provides a good way to view the yang

898
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,759
model

899
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,160
any comments questions

900
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,200
don these are not in the the uh

901
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,079
the working group document correct the

902
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,359
the diagrams

903
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,480
yes yeah no the we didn't put we put a

904
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,760
couple of tests

905
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,960
um of uh

906
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,160
test files so i think it's a1 uh

907
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,920
b1 and b2 the uh the tests are

908
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,640
are in there because other yang

909
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,520
documents

910
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,839
uh typically include some sample

911
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,520
configuration

912
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,520
and we validated that through yanglint

913
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,400
um so we have done that but we haven't

914
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
put the diagrams in because

915
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,400
uh they're not an ascii art and uh um

916
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,480
i i think you don't have to be you could

917
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,800
you could publish them as an appendix

918
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,480
or just include them and they would be

919
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,640
included in the pdf

920
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,960
um i i myself haven't done that so i'm

921
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,480
not quite sure how that works from the

922
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
the you know mechanical processing but i

923
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,079
know you can do it if you want to

924
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,000
just just something to consider is if

925
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,440
you think this is really useful and help

926
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,880
you understand things

927
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,480
um you might want to figure out how to

928
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,079
capture it in the document

929
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,599
there is one also uh comment from jabber

930
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,960
uh this is from

931
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,720
tim costello are any other yang models

932
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,920
for that net outside of the ietf i think

933
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,720
that

934
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,680
are there any defined 4.net outside of

935
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,800
the ietf

936
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,960
and then the follow-up is this yang

937
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,079
model interoperable with

938
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,240
other net yang models from outside the

939
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,720
ietf

940
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,839
so um there there

941
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,520
are um tsn

942
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,000
yang models that are being defined in

943
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,960
the ieee but those are not det-net yang

944
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,680
models

945
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,040
those are tsn ones

946
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,200
so i'm not aware of any

947
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,040
detonate yang models that are being

948
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,079
defined outside the ietf

949
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,760
that are in the public space so

950
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,440
the second part of that question would

951
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,160
be um

952
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,200
then not interoperable um

953
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,000
so but when you talk about

954
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,160
interoperability

955
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,680
in yang i'm not i'm not exactly sure

956
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,520
what you're what you're talking about

957
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
the data plane

958
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
um between the way this

959
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
is implemented is you would configure on

960
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,400
one node you can figure on another node

961
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,320
but the data plane that goes between

962
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,640
that

963
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,599
is standards it's uh either mpls or

964
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,119
um ip right now

965
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,480
and that would be interoperable so i i

966
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,599
don't know what

967
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,560
um interoperable means in the sense of

968
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,480
yang models in this question if they

969
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,680
want to clarify but

970
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,480
this once again q great if they want to

971
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,839
follow up in jabber that's fine but

972
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,560
right now there's

973
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,200
we don't see either of them right

974
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,680
okay so

975
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,839
next chart

976
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,720
so the these are the cases we went

977
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,200
through

978
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,399
so um

979
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,720
i think i think people can read through

980
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,599
the cases basically we considered

981
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,960
aggregation at each layer and the the

982
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,240
model has

983
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,560
so so what we when we were discussing

984
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
this um

985
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,599
we found out that

986
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,839
that net is very recursive in the way it

987
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:54,960
works it can

988
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,200
it can you can take an application and

989
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,720
somebody's application

990
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,200
comes in and goes into a service and

991
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,720
then that service

992
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,319
can be either it can be either a service

993
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:06,800
that

994
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
goes to a forwarding layer or can be a

995
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,680
service that peers with other services

996
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,839
or it can be a service that becomes

997
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,040
basically an application to the service

998
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,200
so we we worked through each one of

999
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,760
those cases and we came up with a branch

1000
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,240
that would would allow us to do that and

1001
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,520
so you do get

1002
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,079
um there there is a question on the list

1003
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,000
i don't know if balance is on here he

1004
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,319
may

1005
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,240
he may step up at the end and have some

1006
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,359
discussion

1007
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,400
but he had some questions about um

1008
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
ethernet going on to these models and

1009
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,560
for ethernet we basically consider

1010
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,440
ethernet

1011
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,000
as an interface and we have some

1012
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,160
attributes on the ethernet that could

1013
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,520
could filter it down to like a vlan

1014
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,200
say or a particular address

1015
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,960
and then it's carried transparently

1016
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,800
across the network

1017
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,200
we don't do anything else with ethernet

1018
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,000
because

1019
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,960
that's not part of the debt net um

1020
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,200
documents that we have but we do cape

1021
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,960
we do carry that across there

1022
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,839
and um

1023
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,799
so

1024
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,520
the the point is that um

1025
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,119
when you're reviewing this just look

1026
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,720
through the models and see

1027
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,800
if if you think that they they make

1028
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,920
sense

1029
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,720
um and if you think of anything else

1030
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,359
that

1031
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,000
um you think is missing you know please

1032
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,040
raise it on the list

1033
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,079
i i have a reply to bella's

1034
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,960
about the ethernet pieces but i may not

1035
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,319
have hit his points on there

1036
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,319
so next chart

1037
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,319
so this is again the the just

1038
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,480
each one of these charts has a diagram

1039
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,760
like this just showing the

1040
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,079
aggregation how it's going on at the

1041
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,520
different places

1042
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,920
so if you're aggregating at the service

1043
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
layer versus the forwarding layer

1044
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,960
that's that's the case that we're

1045
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,760
handling

1046
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,960
go on to the next chart

1047
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,640
and so this is aggregation in this case

1048
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,240
we have um

1049
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,879
forwarding sub layers here and

1050
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,000
we are aggregating

1051
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,400
that net flows one two into a forwarding

1052
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,960
sub layer

1053
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,240
go on to the next chart

1054
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,760
and this is basically showing what

1055
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,160
what's um

1056
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
what's happening again in this case we

1057
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,800
have you can see the forwarding

1058
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,040
sub-layer being aggregated into a

1059
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,440
service and then aggregated into two

1060
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,960
forwarding layers

1061
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,200
so there's just go on to the next chart

1062
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,160
i think these charts speak to themselves

1063
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,680
um

1064
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,040
this is just showing the reverse

1065
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,200
direction for that one next chart

1066
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,440
um so c2 is a relay node

1067
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,279
you can go on to the next chart

1068
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,480
and the corresponding

1069
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,480
aggregation diagram for that what's

1070
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,359
going on there

1071
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,880
so you know we can just go through these

1072
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,839
charts there's nothing

1073
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,760
at this point that i'm not going to deal

1074
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,440
with each one but if there's any

1075
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,880
questions that you know

1076
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,520
you have now or on the list about these

1077
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,359
diagrams

1078
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,400
please feel free to raise them go on to

1079
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,040
the next chart

1080
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,599
yeah that's just the design aggregation

1081
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,680
so we've got the relay node

1082
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,560
um and this one is

1083
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,319
aggregating service sub layers

1084
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,680
into a service sub-layer

1085
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,640
so go on again

1086
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,400
so this one shows where the aggregation

1087
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,040
is happening

1088
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,839
and next chart

1089
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,359
just the reverse direction go on

1090
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,800
and now this is a relay node similar one

1091
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,200
again

1092
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,240
you can just flip through this chart are

1093
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,119
you going to have any

1094
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,280
um slides that cover just the ip only

1095
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,839
case or is everything ip over mpls in

1096
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,480
the examples

1097
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,640
um i don't think we have one that that

1098
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,079
covers the ip only

1099
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,280
the the ip only um there's not much

1100
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,560
difference

1101
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,000
um just the the forwarding

1102
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,480
if you if you go back to the um

1103
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,839
i guess you'd have to go back to the

1104
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,079
tree model if you want to look at it but

1105
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,000
i can point out the differences if you'd

1106
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,440
like

1107
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,520
maybe we'll do really maybe we'll do

1108
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,280
that at the the end

1109
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,319
yeah well we're basically

1110
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,400
there's there's nothing here more than

1111
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,800
examples we really we just

1112
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,480
um wanted people to

1113
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,440
be able to compare with these charts you

1114
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:39,920
know

1115
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,119
um understand what's going on

1116
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,200
and and you know

1117
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,000
i don't think that there's really any

1118
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,960
more value

1119
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,720
in going through the charts other than

1120
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,400
to say that you know

1121
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,560
the value you get about them is is

1122
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
holding up the two of them together and

1123
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,400
saying okay i see the difference here

1124
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,000
and then i can see the difference in the

1125
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,400
configuration

1126
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,760
okay so we can go on so we can either

1127
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,720
keep going through

1128
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,520
just we i think we've got about it there

1129
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,119
is a question in

1130
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,319
the chat window are these configurations

1131
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,359
inspired by particular use cases

1132
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,559
known scenarios and topologies this is

1133
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,359
coming from eve

1134
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,079
so um certainly certainly

1135
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,280
the some of them are inspired by real

1136
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,520
use cases because you want to be able to

1137
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,800
aggregate at each

1138
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,760
layer but some of them

1139
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,440
it started to fall out because

1140
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,480
the nature of the yang model it once you

1141
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,920
aggregate something at the service layer

1142
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,720
and you you you allow services to come

1143
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,520
in

1144
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,040
you end up with these um

1145
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,000
this this hierarchical nature but then

1146
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,760
being able to plug and play them in

1147
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,040
there

1148
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,440
so i

1149
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,240
the they were definitely inspired by

1150
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,960
real use cases but i think the model

1151
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,319
supports

1152
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,880
perhaps more aggregation types than you

1153
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,520
would need

1154
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
in the sense of doing that on a

1155
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,359
particular node you can always

1156
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,599
you can always do this step by step by

1157
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,119
adding another node

1158
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,400
with configuration to like you start an

1159
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,760
application again you have something

1160
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,520
aggregated but then it comes in as an

1161
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,319
application and you could do it that way

1162
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:49,359
so um i don't think there's um

1163
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,520
unnecessary pieces in there but there

1164
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,359
are pieces that would be

1165
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,079
less used and pieces that would be more

1166
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:03,119
used in the model i would say

1167
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,200
thank you thank you though if you have

1168
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,680
anything further

1169
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,839
yeah the the rest of the presentation

1170
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,839
really i mean if we if we want to just

1171
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,079
go back to lou's point and just

1172
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,800
show where an ip model would be in there

1173
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,480
if people think that you know

1174
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,960
we need an ip model example that's not

1175
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,559
hard to

1176
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,800
um

1177
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,280
oh let's go back uh yeah

1178
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,880
no yeah right sorry no the uh

1179
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:45,119
the tree

1180
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,160
well i can't if you give me a slide

1181
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,839
number i can get there

1182
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,279
okay um

1183
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,200
well essentially this diagram here would

1184
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,000
actually show

1185
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,319
so so that your question was have we

1186
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,559
done mostly mpls and we've done mostly

1187
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:03,520
mqls

1188
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,319
going on to the mpls path but the ip

1189
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:06,960
path

1190
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,800
would basically just have the service

1191
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,480
sub layer

1192
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,839
labels being ip and the forwarding sub

1193
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,880
layer being ip so if you go

1194
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,520
next chart

1195
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,440
in next chart

1196
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,200
right here so

1197
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,920
this is the application next chart

1198
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,640
so the service sub layer here if you

1199
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:40,960
look

1200
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,599
if you look midway on the screen it says

1201
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,760
service id and it says debt net flow

1202
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,800
type

1203
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,680
if you're an ip.net flow type you

1204
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,720
configure the

1205
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,240
ip addresses in in these parts

1206
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,800
if you're an mpls flow type you

1207
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,240
configure it later on

1208
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,800
so basically the difference between ip

1209
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,880
and mpls is right there it's captured

1210
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,160
right there

1211
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,319
or that's for the um incoming direction

1212
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,839
and then for the outgoing

1213
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,680
type it's the same thing we have um

1214
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,280
the header type if it's an mpls header

1215
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,200
or if it's an ip header on the right

1216
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,559
hand side

1217
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,800
you would configure it as an ip header

1218
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,480
so that's the only difference

1219
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,640
in the model between doing an alt all ip

1220
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,240
and and an all uh an mpls one

1221
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,200
the other thing about the ip is because

1222
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,839
you can specify

1223
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,280
you can specify prefixes on the

1224
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,760
input of the ip you can do some

1225
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,720
aggregation

1226
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,079
with ip prefixes in the ip model so we

1227
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,440
don't have

1228
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,359
like we said the ip and ip tunnels but

1229
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,559
we do have

1230
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,599
aggregating prefixes on the incoming

1231
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,880
side so you could do that

1232
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:02,079
so maybe in summary i can say that the

1233
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:02,480
young

1234
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,280
model itself supports the that net ip

1235
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,720
data plane

1236
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,599
you just rolled out in the presentation

1237
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,480
more amperes examples

1238
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,640
yeah and and that one that was probably

1239
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,839
just a habit

1240
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,440
though there was no reason for that

1241
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,319
other than habit

1242
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,960
if you do end up putting this material

1243
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,839
into the append

1244
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,520
into an appendix i think it would be

1245
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,760
good to include some ip

1246
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,319
um pure ip examples

1247
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,040
both for the normal case and the

1248
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,800
aggregated case

1249
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,240
and i see we have david black in queue

1250
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,520
okay i would agree with

1251
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,000
uh with your remarks one of the nice

1252
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,680
things about the mpls data plane

1253
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,920
is every time you do the aggregation um

1254
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,200
you've got a label

1255
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,200
that shows you the aggregation the ip

1256
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,800
data plane has to do

1257
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,200
some of this implicitly so starting from

1258
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,319
mpls

1259
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,960
at the very least leads to clarity in

1260
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,400
this discussion

1261
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,000
um and then writing up the ip examples

1262
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,359
that would be useful

1263
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,720
and maybe in uh if we find

1264
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,480
serious gaps there it might lead to

1265
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,400
somebody trying to figure out uh how to

1266
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,640
do an ipip data plane to fill the gaps

1267
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,319
we need to understand the gaps are first

1268
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,079
yeah we don't think there's any gaps

1269
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,359
from an ip perspective

1270
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,640
but um you know we can we can definitely

1271
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,839
um spin up a test case to make sure

1272
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,400
and the the the question i guess is do

1273
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,440
do people

1274
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,720
find you know we we we put a a few

1275
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,559
example models in we didn't want to

1276
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,480
bloat the document with it but if

1277
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,920
people really find that hey this uh

1278
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,400
i don't know what you call it um um

1279
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,000
dictionary of examples basically

1280
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,319
is really useful and we should capture

1281
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,760
it in the document that's

1282
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,559
that's good information to have too i'm

1283
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:03,119
certainly

1284
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,440
finding it very useful in particular the

1285
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,920
pleasant surprise i wasn't expecting

1286
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,760
is that it provides a solid foundation

1287
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,559
to understand how what this aggregation

1288
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,200
looks like

1289
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,359
in the iep data plane where we don't

1290
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,640
have the ability

1291
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,760
uh to add additional uh additional uh

1292
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,839
addressing info

1293
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,240
okay i see

1294
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,920
bella's in the queue yes don thank you

1295
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,839
very much for the summary so

1296
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,079
my question on the list was related to

1297
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,079
the sub network scenarios

1298
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,400
but now in your presentation you have

1299
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,920
also highlighted that

1300
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,240
this is out of scope in the current

1301
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,520
young model

1302
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,880
so where i was somewhat somewhat worried

1303
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,760
is if you are using for example a tsn

1304
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,280
sub network

1305
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,559
and that net node is a dsm aware.net

1306
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,640
node as defined in the

1307
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,160
in the drafts then you need

1308
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,559
some mapping between the that net flows

1309
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,880
and the tsn streams

1310
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,559
uh and i think this is a point where uh

1311
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:17,839
ieee specified young model and idea

1312
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,520
specified young model

1313
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,400
have to find a common connection point

1314
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,079
so that that was my major uh question

1315
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,240
on on the list regarding the sub network

1316
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,200
scenarios but

1317
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,760
as i understand now it is some further

1318
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,000
work

1319
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,520
okay a follow-on to that is

1320
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,720
other large yang models

1321
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,119
have sometimes written a section about

1322
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,799
future augmentation

1323
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,079
so clearly there's going to be

1324
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,839
definitions for tsn

1325
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,400
if you attended raw earlier today you

1326
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,680
would have heard them talking about

1327
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,720
building on

1328
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,200
uh the the base.net model so they might

1329
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,720
have some definition so it would

1330
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,960
it would be good to have a section sort

1331
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
of an informative section for the

1332
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,440
the future model designers that you know

1333
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,119
the derivative model designers to talk

1334
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,400
about how you envision

1335
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,680
augmentations for technology specifics

1336
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,040
you know where they would end up

1337
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,960
plugging into this model

1338
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,720
or whether they'd be their own model

1339
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:31,839
however you see it being done

1340
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,960
all right um well that's all i have if

1341
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,280
there's if there's no more questions

1342
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,960
um there is one more

1343
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,960
note on the ch in the chat that examples

1344
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,319
are very informative

1345
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:49,440
we should add them okay

1346
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:55,680
i also saw andy malus as you can read

1347
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,599
redraw the diagrams in s vg i don't know

1348
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,520
whether he was joking on that

1349
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,119
but i also have powerpoint exported as

1350
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,760
svg i'm pretty sure uh we have toilets

1351
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,880
oh is that is that

1352
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,599
the um oh okay you can yeah it's just

1353
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:12,160
one that

1354
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,280
um if you do it in svg it it can um

1355
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,359
map to many formats and i guess the

1356
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,119
implication there is is that the tooling

1357
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,319
likes svg

1358
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:21,839
uh but we're running out of time so

1359
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,799
trollus is in queue

1360
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,680
hello toilets and if i unmute myself it

1361
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,559
works better

1362
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,960
um so thank you very much this is this

1363
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,160
is a lot of

1364
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,400
great work and i'm always wondering how

1365
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,200
to actually validate this stuff right so

1366
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,119
beside you know people with hopefully

1367
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:43,040
insight looking at it and providing

1368
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,880
feedback are there any you know

1369
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,040
implementation or other validation plans

1370
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,880
beyond just you know manual review

1371
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,799
um so i don't have a

1372
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,000
an answer to that uh maybe others on the

1373
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,400
the the team have an answer to that uh

1374
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,040
didn't you

1375
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,799
can you talk about the validation that

1376
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:06,400
you've already done

1377
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,799
well we i mean the validation that we've

1378
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,599
done is yangling validation

1379
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:15,040
um so

1380
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,640
but but you you are still with with

1381
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,200
yangon

1382
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:24,319
validation you are basically doing a um

1383
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:27,599
you're exercising the model um

1384
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:30,559
but it's still up to someone to say that

1385
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,079
you know you've got all the pieces in

1386
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:33,280
there

1387
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,799
um right i mean

1388
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,280
so kind of uh is this stuff in the model

1389
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,000
necessary and sufficient to actually

1390
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,880
you know operate a a running.net service

1391
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,599
right any

1392
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,440
running.net service even if just a

1393
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,720
simulated

1394
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,399
emulated whatever one right

1395
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,079
yeah so i mean as far as ip and mpls

1396
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,160
we've used standard models and pieces

1397
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,400
like that so

1398
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,480
we think it hangs together but i i don't

1399
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,319
have an uh a specific

1400
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,799
implementation of it and there might be

1401
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,559
others in the group that that are

1402
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,880
participating that have been taken

1403
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,200
further

1404
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,440
a comment from andy that he's being

1405
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,880
serious about svg

1406
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,240
and that is the way that the xml v3 rfc

1407
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,839
format allows you to include

1408
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,280
uh graphics in line okay uh

1409
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,440
with that we have 30 seconds left so

1410
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,799
final words uh don

1411
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,960
i'm good okay uh janos

1412
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,760

1413
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,880
