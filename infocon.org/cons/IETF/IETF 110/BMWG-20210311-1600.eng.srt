so um in next generation firewall while

172
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,000
benchmarking

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,479
uh we had a working group last call on

174
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,919
version o5

175
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
which really generated a lot of good

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,199
comments

177
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
and um we

178
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
you know i'm going to shut my email down

179
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
now i think

180
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,870
good all right uh so then um

181
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,880
[Music]

182
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
so now we have the revised uh version

183
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,800
zero six

184
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
and um looking it over i think we're

185
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
gonna want a conformational uh working

186
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,639
group last call

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,599
after uh an editor some more looking at

188
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,720
it

189
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
we may want to resolve uh some things

190
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,639
which i'll talk about today

191
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,639
uh but then you know we're gonna give i

192
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,080
think we're gonna give folks a little

193
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,919
more time to look at this and make sure

194
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,479
that

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,400
that all the many comments the first

196
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,840
working group best call

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,479
uh precipitated have been

198
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,840
resolved so thanks uh

199
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
and and we have a main uh topic to talk

200
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
about there to the status

201
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
of that document so then uh proposals

202
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:17,759
keep coming

203
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,240
uh we're trying to make way for new work

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
here i think

205
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,919
and uh with with all the drafts we've

206
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,440
we've talked about uh just

207
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
before and we did we did adopt new work

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,719
as i mentioned the multiple loss rate

209
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,880
search which is part of our working

210
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,320
group documents now

211
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
um most but most of the proposals are

212
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,320
very familiar to us so we

213
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,479
we should probably try to make some some

214
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,360
uh

215
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,519
uh adoptions let's say

216
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,720
let's say you know ones

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
working group drafts or individual

218
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,640
drafts that are

219
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
are really receiving attention from the

220
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,080
working group

221
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
we can we can probably consider them for

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,399
as strong candidates for

223
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,320
adoption all right so on the milestones

224
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,760
we're a little bit behind on a few

225
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,080
things here uh

226
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,040
but um i think we can we can resolve uh

227
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
quite a few of these

228
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,480
uh fairly quickly and and early this

229
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,519
year

230
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
and then uh we'll be we'll be in a

231
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
position to update others uh add some

232
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,839
more

233
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,839
maybe maybe drop a few of these where we

234
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
don't see any progress and

235
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,080
that's a topic for the the chairs to

236
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,480
deal with

237
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,839
so any questions on the working group

238
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
status

239
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
i see we've got some stuff in the chat

240
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
here oh good afternoon

241
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
all right sorry bro that was probably a

242
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,920
half hour ago

243
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,360
all right let's go back up here good

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,680
all right so um i think this was shared

245
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
with the working group but

246
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,680
but just in case it wasn't i'm i'm back

247
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
showing a slide here

248
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,519
titled uh transport area and area

249
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,079
director

250
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,240
transport area director review of the uh

251
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,720
back-to-back frame benchmarking uh

252
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,279
update

253
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,560
uh draft so um

254
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,839
we we had exactly one sentence

255
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,040
in uh the draft and uh it drew upon

256
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,560
uh the guidance from rfc 2544

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,920
uh which specified a simple waiting time

258
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,800
for the device under test cues to empty

259
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,000
uh after the tran transmitted load

260
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,279
uh ceased at the at the end of a trial

261
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,720
and that time traditionally and

262
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,320
uh for for many years

263
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,839
has been sufficient at uh two seconds

264
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,560
so we we got a transport area review of

265
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,200
the

266
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
back to back frame draft which basically

267
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,600
pointed out that

268
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
uh the the buffer sizes

269
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,560
in our devices under test today

270
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,320
could be very much uh longer than

271
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
the titan longer than the buffer lengths

272
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,519
we've tested in the past

273
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
they could be one and a half seconds

274
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,839
long

275
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,320
and they could be what the transport

276
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,440
area calls

277
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,279
a buffer bloat size buffers

278
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,440
and uh anything you know anything in the

279
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
one second realm

280
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
one second two seconds whatever it

281
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
happens to be

282
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
if you're if you're um if you're sending

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
with a high enough rate to

284
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,279
fill the buffers of the device under

285
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
test then

286
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,040
uh the implication is that you likely

287
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240
have to wait

288
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,639
uh longer than two seconds and to be

289
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,360
safe

290
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
you might have to wait uh 30 seconds or

291
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,880
more

292
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,680
for all frames to exit the device under

293
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,160
test

294
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
you know i kind of found that to be a

295
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
bit shocking but um

296
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,519
this was the advice that we got and um

297
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,120
you know i have to say that that once

298
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
this discussion got rolling

299
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,240
uh our our old uh friend and chairman

300
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
emeritus

301
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,519
uh scott bradner weighed in on on the

302
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,480
topic

303
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
and helped to clarify it and and um you

304
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,560
know we all

305
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,040
basically recognized especially it took

306
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
some time for me to recognize

307
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,480
what what exact components we needed to

308
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,079
nail down in order to

309
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,079
express this clearly especially because

310
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,399
you know the in fact the buffer sizes

311
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,279
that i've been

312
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,839
uh benchmarking recently are very very

313
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,519
much smaller than anything that would

314
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,000
call

315
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
be called uh buffer we're working in the

316
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,480
microsecond range let's put it that way

317
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,160
and and that's why it's important to

318
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,720
have the correction factors that we

319
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
uh that we have here and and so forth

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
that's a

321
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
good it's been a good use of of this uh

322
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,320
of this draft

323
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,880
so here's where we ended up with with uh

324
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,839
text

325
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
um and it's a lot more than one second

326
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
second i'm sorry

327
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
it's a lot more than one sentence now as

328
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,959
as you can see

329
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,600
so in the section on the test for a

330
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
single frame size

331
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
uh each trial in the test this is where

332
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
you're trying to find the longest

333
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,760
burst of frames that will pass through

334
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,279
uh loss free

335
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,399
so each trial requires the tester to

336
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,079
send a burst of frames

337
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,920
and with the minimum inner frame gap

338
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
and we count the corresponding frames

339
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,360
forwarded by the

340
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,040
that we're looking for zero laws so

341
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,199
the duration of the trial includes three

342
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
required components and this is

343
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,920
this is the text we agreed on and iesg

344
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,000
approved

345
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,639
so the the first component is the time

346
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,240
to send the burst of frames

347
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
the second component is the time to

348
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,279
receive the transferred

349
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,680
burst of frames and and this of course

350
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
might overlap

351
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,120
uh the first component in time

352
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,880
and then a third component of time

353
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,000
at least two seconds not overlapping the

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,720
time

355
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,000
to receive the burst in into and to

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
ensure that the

357
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,959
buffers have depleted so

358
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,040
longer times must be used when

359
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
conditions warrant

360
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
such as when buffer times are greater

361
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
than two seconds

362
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,920
and uh and are measured and or when the

363
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,160
burst sending times are greater than two

364
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,279
seconds

365
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,320
so care is needed since this

366
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,399
time component directly increases the

367
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,920
trial duration

368
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,360
and many trials and tests comprise a

369
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,279
complete benchmarking study

370
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,519
so we can't really just in you know

371
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,480
increase

372
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,680
uh this waiting time uh without an

373
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,519
overall time penalty

374
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,839
and those of us who have been you know

375
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,360
testing and testing and testing and

376
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,279
waiting for results to show up

377
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
uh you know this the the waiting time

378
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,440
after a trial

379
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
has a direct impact so it's a balance to

380
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,199
strike

381
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,120
and and i think we've got some wording

382
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
here now that uh

383
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
that does that so

384
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
um and we also mentioned the upper limit

385
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,199
uh

386
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,839
for the for the time to send each burst

387
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,399
uh must

388
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,279
be configurable uh to values as high as

389
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,560
30 seconds

390
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,759
uh buffer time results reported at or

391
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,279
near the upper limit

392
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,600
are likely invalid uh we saw some of

393
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,519
that in the um

394
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,480
open platform for nfv benchmarking

395
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
testing

396
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,600
where um uh basically the at the

397
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,040
at the larger frame rates uh

398
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,240
the uh packet forwarding rate was equal

399
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,600
to the back to back

400
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
uh frame at the large for the large

401
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,839
frame sizes

402
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
and and that means you don't um you

403
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
don't accumulate a buffer

404
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,279
or a queue and uh you you basically

405
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,360
uh you basically send and send and send

406
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,959
and then you report this maximum

407
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,839
configured

408
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,600
uh time and buffer length um

409
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,240
the the the resolution for that is

410
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
something else we've attacked in this

411
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,399
draft

412
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,839
where we have the the rfc 2544

413
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,639
throughput tests take place first and

414
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:32,959
then

415
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,320
any any tests where the frame size

416
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,800
yields a uh the maximum theoretical

417
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,360
frame rate then uh you don't test that

418
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,959
for uh

419
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,759
for back to back frame benchmark and the

420
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,240
and the

421
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,800
uh attempt to infer the buffer time

422
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,399
so i've talked a lot

423
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:05,839
any any questions or comments about that

424
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
no all right well this may

425
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,599
this this may very well impact our um

426
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,799
our future drafts because we're likely

427
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,520
to get

428
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,919
you know sort of the same uh transport

429
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,119
area comment

430
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,240
uh regarding buffer bloat sizes

431
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,880
and uh and we have to be ready for it

432
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,240
and

433
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,120
that's why i share this experience maybe

434
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,880
we can head that one off at the pass in

435
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,760
the

436
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
uh in our in our future work where this

437
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,039
is relevant

438
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,439
okay

439
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,039
so that's the chairman's status and um

440
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,280
let's let's check out our agenda here

441
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,559
quickly

442
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
so our our next topic is the uh is the

443
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
evpn

444
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
draft status and uh sarah i'll give you

445
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
another opportunity here to explain uh

446
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:13,919
what happened and where we are thank you

447
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,320
sarah

448
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,840
all right

449
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,200
um could someone confirm that i'm still

450
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,760
being heard

451
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
yes you're well okay

452
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,120
okay good thank you all right

453
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,120
well then um i'll cover this this

454
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
quickly uh

455
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
as i said we had a good uh good couple

456
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
of reviews

457
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
and uh this is now in working group last

458
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,559
call i think the last day it

459
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,799
is march uh 23rd so that covers our

460
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,320
um our our responsibilities here

461
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,039
and um we'll move this along and again

462
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,600
thanks to everyone uh brian and sadine

463
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,640
who

464
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
uh helped get the draft to o7 much

465
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,640
appreciated

466
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,320
all right so then um brian

467
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,840
um i've got your uh next generation

468
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,160
firewall benchmarking draft

469
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,039
queued up here next so i'll bring up the

470
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
slides

471
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,520
and i will try to do something here with

472
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
the

473
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,080
with the screen to make them

474
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
maximally visible okay all right

475
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,240
just go to just go to the second slide

476
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,840
got it all right um so

477
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,039
uh just jumping right in uh as al

478
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,039
indicated we received um

479
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,600
a boatload of uh comments and uh

480
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,480
suggestions

481
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,760
uh our count estimates that it was like

482
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
well over 70. um a significant number of

483
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,919
them were uh

484
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,400
requests for clarification and uh

485
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,840
grammatical changes

486
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,440
if you do a diff um between uh five and

487
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,840
uh

488
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,960
six you'll you'll see uh you know what

489
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
was changed in uh

490
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,919
in this area um the rest of this is

491
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
going to be sort of going over what we

492
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,880
consider to be the

493
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,400
significant uh changes so in examination

494
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
of uh the intent of the draft

495
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,760
and uh and the additions of uh

496
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,159
the security effectiveness section to

497
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,240
include network ips we changed the

498
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,120
target

499
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,799
of the draft from next generation

500
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,640
firewalls to network

501
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,159
uh security uh devices um

502
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,799
al brought to our attention um early on

503
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,240
in the review process

504
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,360
uh we need to needed to consider whether

505
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,240
or not this

506
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,720
uh supersedes rfc

507
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,559
3511. we did some had some internal

508
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,799
discussions and reviewed it and we do

509
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,760
believe that

510
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,360
this this draft should supersede uh 3511

511
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,320
and we had uh text in the uh beginning

512
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,679
of the draft explaining

513
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,200
explaining why and uh

514
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,640
under the test bed setup of section four

515
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,880
um we uh modif modified that somewhat to

516
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,039
uh reference section three of rfc 6815

517
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,640
in order to avoid reinventing the

518
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,360
wheel and again that was a suggestion

519
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,760
from

520
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,720
one of the reviewers we clarified the

521
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,400
security definitions

522
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,720
um uh contained in section 42

523
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,679
table 3. it's pretty uh significant

524
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,120
rewrite just to

525
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,320
make it a lot clearer and uh to sort of

526
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,360
bring some sort of

527
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,440
um commonality to the language used

528
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,400
in you know to line up with other uh

529
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
definitions

530
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,799
used elsewhere then we totally we did a

531
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,760
significant rewrite of section 6.3

532
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,039
which was originally just uh the kpi

533
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,080
section

534
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,120
um we changed the name to benchmarks and

535
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
kpis and the goal was to

536
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,799
uh clarify and eliminate any of the

537
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,039
ambiguities that existed and there were

538
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,440
there were a number of them and uh we

539
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,240
used

540
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,840
rfc 2647 definitions

541
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,159
where it was um where it was applicable

542
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,600
and it um

543
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
it was applicable in a number of cases i

544
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,640
think

545
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,280
three or four of them in uh in the

546
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
section

547
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,039
so those are the terms and definitions

548
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:41,919
um

549
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,600
just to give folks a little background

550
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,039
here who might be new to this

551
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,600
those are the terms and and definitions

552
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
uh that supported

553
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,000
rfc uh 3511.

554
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,840
uh there were you know there was a time

555
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,600
when we traditionally

556
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,960
wrote our our terms uh in a terminology

557
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,919
draft

558
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,919
um you know where the definitions also

559
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,159
appeared and then the methodology was a

560
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,360
separate draft

561
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,799
and that dates all the way back to the

562
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,400
very first pair of drafts

563
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,799
that came out of the benchmarking

564
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,320
methodology working group

565
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,840
so uh it's it's really good that you're

566
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,799
you know uh getting uh some consistency

567
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,240
with those terms

568
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,200
brian since you've got a lot of good

569
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,840
items

570
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,960
on this uh particular slide here

571
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,679
uh i'd i'd like to interrupt and and

572
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,559
maybe we can

573
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,679
hold some of the discussion that we uh

574
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,799
had planned um just so that we can um

575
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,440
uh close on a few items how many by the

576
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,840
way how many slides have you got here

577
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,000
just one more after this oh all right

578
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,919
then this is uh let me take a quick look

579
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,480
at it

580
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,559
all right so there's more changes there

581
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,679
all right so we'll we'll

582
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,000
so let's handle this uh set of changes

583
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
first

584
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
all right so so does you know i forgot

585
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,320
to check this does this mean

586
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,159
that the uh that the title of the of the

587
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
document has uh changed now which is

588
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,880
that yeah it it it does

589
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,360
it um more accurately uh reflects the

590
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,240
scope of the

591
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,520
draft good good because you know i

592
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,120
i suddenly one day i suddenly

593
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,559
began to wonder um uh well what do they

594
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,640
mean by next generation you know

595
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
are we really talking about the modern

596
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,559
generation of firewalls the ones that

597
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,240
are here now and

598
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,520
and um uh and and this is a less a much

599
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,279
less ambiguous title

600
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,000
so uh thanks for thanks for going there

601
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,279
with that uh change

602
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,000
yeah that's that's good as well uh does

603
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,960
that mean that the

604
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,159
the the um the file names um should

605
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,159
change as well then going forward

606
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,400
um you think it's currently embedded in

607
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,240
files ngfw of course

608
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,919
no absolutely not let's let's um let's

609
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,400
let's

610
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,279
let's not do that in fact okay that's

611
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,080
right there are

612
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,840
there there are ways to track that

613
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,679
fairly automatically now

614
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,360
uh but um it's absolutely not necessary

615
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,480
uh get at this point yeah oh i get it

616
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,760
yep that's fine all right so then um so

617
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
so we so we've got that change and then

618
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,279
we've got another

619
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,480
uh uh topic here uh

620
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,279
the the author proposal since we brought

621
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,240
this up

622
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,440
is uh to have this draft

623
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,400
uh supersede rc 3511 which is the

624
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,679
uh you know the roughly 15 year old

625
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,880
benchmarking methodology for

626
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,919
uh firewalls um

627
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,960
so uh what we what we

628
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,440
what we need to discuss is is um whether

629
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,520
the working group agrees with that

630
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,720
and then we also have to uh sync it up

631
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,520
with

632
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,600
uh the ietf terminology where um

633
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,799
supersede is kind of in the middle

634
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,360
between

635
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,120
where we we might call update

636
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,760
um and and of course there's a you know

637
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
there's a million definitions for what

638
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,799
what constitutes an update in

639
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,880
in ietf i think there's some good ones

640
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,320
out there and they may have even tried

641
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,159
to standardize a few

642
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,520
but um but the but the obsolete uh

643
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,720
definition is is fairly clear and

644
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,760
and i think that's what you meant with

645
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
with

646
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,640
i think we lost out oh

647
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,919
yep now the interesting part is how long

648
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,600
it takes him to realize it

649
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,120
let me see if i can pull down the

650
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:06,810
materials as well

651
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,869
[Music]

652
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,919
how did you hit did you hit mute by

653
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,640
accident maybe

654
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,559
although although maybe i didn't hit it

655
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,080
and um and something else happened

656
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
but now it looks like i'm i'm i'm back

657
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,440
and the screen

658
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,640
is visible as well no no i don't see you

659
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,080
sharing

660
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,440
oh okay all right let's try that again

661
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,559
presentation view uh okay

662
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,559
yeah it looks like it completely reset

663
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,320
my um

664
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,520
my settings here

665
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,000
so let's go with uh entire screen again

666
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,760
allow and now it looks like it's going

667
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,440
all right you don't run solar winds do

668
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,360
you uh

669
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,520
no

670
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,919
yeah it looks like there was a um there

671
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,840
was a bobble here that

672
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,600
caused me to drop maybe momentarily

673
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
enough to lose everything so let's

674
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,840
continue

675
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,120
forward um i i i assume that

676
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,520
somewhere in this uh discussion of

677
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,559
supersedes

678
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,919
i i was basically trying to get the

679
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,919
answer to the question do you think

680
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,600
supersedes means to make

681
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,200
rfc 3511 rf uh

682
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
obsolete that is our

683
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,080
uh our sense of things when we reviewed

684
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,320
3511

685
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,679
and compared it with where the state of

686
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:46,159
uh the

687
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,520
uh of the technologies were today um

688
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,799
uh compared to uh what we're

689
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,960
looking to achieve with uh with this

690
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,919
draft

691
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,559
we felt that uh that the changes were

692
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,919
significant enough that it would

693
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,799
supersede 35 11.

694
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,840
okay all right so so then

695
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,320
it sounds like in in our ietf

696
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,679
terminology that would

697
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,640
we would need to update the header uh to

698
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,399
say that uh

699
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,480
that this uh sort of the status

700
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,760
obsoletes

701
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,799
uh rc3511 uh

702
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,640
that's going to have to go into the

703
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,919
abstract

704
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,960
and we'll have to edit the uh that intro

705
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,720
paragraph right at the end the last

706
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,600
sentence

707
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,200
uh to use the terminology

708
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,760
if we did we did update the uh the

709
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
introduction uh

710
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,520
paragraph uh right at the end we we are

711
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,080
now saying

712
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,240
that says um all these reasons have led

713
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,600
to the creation of a new

714
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,480
uh network security device benchmarking

715
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,880
document and this document supersedes

716
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,960
35 right so that so the key point though

717
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,600
uh brian is that we have to use the word

718
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,640
obsolete

719
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,840
or makes obsolete uh

720
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,960
okay rc 3511. and that's okay and that's

721
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,440
it

722
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,039
and that's if the working group agrees

723
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,480
on that so

724
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
um understood so uh

725
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,640
i'm gonna i mean it's a you know always

726
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,919
an unofficial ask

727
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,440
when we're in the uh um

728
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,919
we're in the live meeting like this but

729
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,240
are there are there any objections

730
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,159
to obsoleting uh

731
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,600
or making obsolete rfc 3511

732
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,200
in the context of publishing uh the uh

733
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,799
the the draft that we're discussing now

734
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,760
hi uh speaking as a participant

735
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,399
when you say network security device i

736
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,120
think that spans a pretty enormous set

737
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,640
of devices

738
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,919
um clearly next generation

739
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,840
we can arm wrestle over next generation

740
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,039
but a firewall is

741
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,519
pretty clearly in line pretty clearing

742
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,720
uh pretty clearly

743
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
transmitting and receiving but there's a

744
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
whole another set of devices that are

745
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,840
just passive

746
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,600
and so they wouldn't even be doing that

747
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,799
but they would absolutely call

748
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,120
themselves a network security device

749
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,039
so that the change in title i was

750
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
wondering if if you could say more

751
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,080
in in specifically

752
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,320
why go to such a generic term versus

753
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,679
just shoring up your

754
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,679
potential um confusion over hey next gen

755
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
versus current or modern or what have

756
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,039
you

757
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,760
well uh and it's interesting sarah i

758
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
just put up on the screen here uh

759
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,120
bala has made a comment uh in which he

760
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,600
says

761
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,799
uh no change in the title uh the title

762
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,720
is benchmarking methodology

763
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,000
uh for uh network security device

764
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,960
performance

765
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,640
was used in the previous version i

766
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,120
assume he means rc 3511

767
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,960
as well no no no i mean i mean

768
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,720
we keep constantly the previous version

769
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
i mean zero five

770
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,679
so oh okay okay all right we have the

771
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:04,000
same

772
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,159
same name but we changed the wording

773
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,559
okay if you see the introduction

774
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,279
we just thought okay this draft not only

775
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,080
for the

776
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,480
next generation firewall so also for

777
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,559
other security next generation security

778
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,240
devices is applicable to

779
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,320
benchmarking okay all right

780
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,039
so let's do this um

781
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,159
so i'll i'll re-read the current draft

782
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,320
but as it stands as a participant

783
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
it's going to take a lot to convince me

784
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,679
that one draft is going to cover

785
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,440
benchmarking the passive and the active

786
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,600
devices because i absolutely wouldn't

787
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,080
expect

788
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,279
that um open to being surprised

789
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,799
uh but highly skeptical

790
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,039
and again if you are really going after

791
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,480
uh

792
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,240
if you're really going after a firewall

793
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,080
i see it even in the abstract now it's

794
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,960
it's it's got

795
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,519
ngids and ips which is an interesting

796
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,720
term but

797
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,640
i i i i'm just saying hey as a

798
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
participant you're it's going to take a

799
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
lot to convince me that that's the

800
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,360
right approach to take um i definitely

801
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,880
wouldn't test my ideas the same way i

802
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,159
would a firewall that that's not

803
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,679
instinctively how it comes across

804
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,320
so i will re-read it with a fine finer

805
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,519
toothed comb

806
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,120
and circle back with feedback just

807
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,039
proactively giving you the hey

808
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,279
i think taking on such a generic broad

809
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,559
wide term

810
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,919
um is is is going to be

811
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,000
it feels like a tough sell so

812
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,360
fair enough um given

813
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
given that and given that you know what

814
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,600
we've developed here

815
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,880
um in in our collect in our opinion

816
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,799
goes way beyond the scope of just the

817
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,799
next generation firewall

818
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,120
um and you know we have moved all of the

819
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,039
all the security effectiveness

820
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,880
stuff regarding the x-ray stream

821
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,360
firewalls the next generations ipx

822
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,760
down to an appendix and clearly focused

823
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,640
on

824
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,519
performance testing aspects of things

825
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,159
you know

826
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,960
we we think that it would definitely

827
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,719
lend itself to

828
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,079
you know next-generation firewalls

829
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,000
next-generation ips's where that

830
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,119
firewalls

831
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,320
you know anything that any network

832
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,440
security

833
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,480
device that is handles

834
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
um you know traffic and makes a security

835
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,119
decision

836
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,159
based on that um

837
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,960
if if if you agree with that statement

838
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,199
and that that's an assumption on my part

839
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,119
um if you agree with that statement then

840
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,639
how should we

841
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,800
um change the title of the document

842
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,839
that to more fit with what your thinking

843
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,079
is

844
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,839
then hey you didn't mention ids which is

845
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,599
a really good example so pulling that i

846
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,960
think helps

847
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,240
um but

848
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,160
so can i defer to answer that i mean

849
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,920
knee jerk what i would say is

850
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,839
benchmarking firewalls or whatever we're

851
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,040
going to call on g

852
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,200
uh fw and then ips's makes lots of sense

853
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,000
um but let me re-read it again uh and

854
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,960
come back

855
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,400
with that question in the back of my

856
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
mind and i'll circle back on the list

857
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,599
uh to give you some feedback so so one

858
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,040
of one of the things we're

859
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,079
wanting to avoid is have a

860
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,079
test lab decide that they want to use

861
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,520
this draft

862
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,640
to do testing and uh they say well we

863
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
can use it in the web app firewall space

864
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
from the performance requirements aspect

865
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
of things

866
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,200
and then have a waff vendor say yeah but

867
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,960
it's not meant for wafts because in the

868
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,119
title it says such and such

869
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,520
so i mean we're trying to avoid that

870
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,960
i understand like i i would say the same

871
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,160
thing though let me um

872
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,760
re-read it again with your question in

873
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,839
mind and the objection you're trying to

874
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,720
avoid

875
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,160
and let me see if i can come back with

876
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,560
some reasonable um

877
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,000
if i'm going to say no let me see if i

878
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,359
can come back with some proposals that

879
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,640
might make sense

880
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,920
yeah thanks a lot sarah that i

881
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,240
appreciate that oh thank you very good

882
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,359
so um i so i i didn't hear any

883
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,240
objections

884
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,839
to uh making 3511 obsolete

885
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,119
but but it sounds like we've got a

886
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,440
little more discussion to to

887
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,560
undertake anyway um but in the

888
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,839
but in the next um in the next draft

889
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,720
let's try that

890
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,440
let's try the uh let's that the you know

891
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,960
that the working group looks at

892
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,000
let's uh let's try that as a obsolete

893
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,680
uh 3511 11 and and see what the

894
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,440
reactions are uh because that's

895
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
something that's definitely got to be um

896
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,680
you know uh confirmed on the mailing

897
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,760
list at the very least

898
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,040
all right so then um

899
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,079
one other one one other topic that

900
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,760
uh came to me in in my review uh brian

901
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,040
bala and carson by the way you know

902
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,400
thanks so much for

903
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,200
taking on 70 comments and and i'm sure

904
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
that was really honorous

905
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
uh toward the end of the process here

906
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,079
we're really making

907
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,560
good progress of toward clarification

908
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,200
and

909
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,079
and uh moving this up to the next step

910
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,640
um yeah bella didn't sleep much

911
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,599
no no and and and and i and i i know

912
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,240
exactly

913
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,320
where you're living bala i got i got

914
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,760
i've got the same

915
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,480
uh same situation on my hands elsewhere

916
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,200
uh so let's uh let's let's look at this

917
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,400
it's the

918
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
uh the rewrite of uh section 6.3

919
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,839
uh that's the benchmarks and and kpis

920
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,320
and and when i when i went through that

921
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,119
i

922
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,800
i fairly i fairly quickly

923
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,090
noticed that the term

924
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:57,389
[Music]

925
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,839
so here's the procedures here's the

926
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,359
tests here it is

927
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,760
so we we we still got the term

928
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,400
throughput

929
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:14,720
and um in benchmarking methodology

930
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,599
working group

931
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:18,480
we've got a pretty solid definition of

932
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,640
throughput right now

933
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,280
but it doesn't come from 2647.

934
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,000
in fact

935
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,920
what you'll quickly see here is that

936
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,160
the term the term throughput

937
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,440
it it's not defined in 2647

938
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,800
and i think if if and if you're

939
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,920
really if we're talking about um

940
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,119
uh tcp or or other uh

941
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,119
you know reliable transport layer

942
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,400
traffic

943
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,960
then i think we're talking about where

944
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,240
is it i think it's

945
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,439
it's good put yeah

946
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,000
the number of bits per unit time

947
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,760
forwarded to the correct destination

948
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,960
interface

949
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,240
uh minus any lost are transmitted so

950
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,079
well i think all of the

951
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,359
i think universally uh

952
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,800
i'm probably sticking my neck out a

953
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,640
little bit when i say universally but

954
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,800
a significant majority of the security

955
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,000
product vendors didn't

956
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,200
like us using goodput

957
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,240
ouch yeah so um

958
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,599
do you do you mean do you mean reliable

959
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,320
transport protocol throughput or or

960
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,839
specifically

961
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,560
um i mean i i wouldn't see i wouldn't

962
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,480
want to add an adjective here like

963
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,440
tcp throughput because you know pretty

964
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,960
quickly people are going to want to talk

965
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,440
about

966
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,079
uh reliable transport uh

967
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,200
throughput which is based on um udp and

968
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,960
quick

969
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,480
right and um and that was one of the

970
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,680
other things that kind of

971
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,839
was bouncing around in my mind when we

972
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,280
were talking about next generation

973
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
firewalls as well and you're just

974
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,119
throwing that terminology out

975
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,560
so um uh

976
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
you know we we need to we need to be

977
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,960
sure the vendors understand that

978
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,359
uh the benchmarking methodology working

979
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,560
group has already claimed this term

980
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,160
okay and uh certainly yeah that

981
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,079
makes sense if we need so all i was

982
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,079
always going to say is if we need to

983
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,319
only back up if we need to um

984
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,079
if we need to explain what happened here

985
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,319
uh oh this is yeah wait

986
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,800
and then this one if we if we need to

987
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,359
call this

988
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,480
good put but then but then make some

989
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,560
explanatory statement later

990
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,760
about um you know the

991
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,000
devices in the marketplace sometimes

992
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,200
call this uh

993
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,520
throughput uh but it's different from

994
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,480
the rc 2544 throughput

995
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,160
and you know on and on and and uh

996
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,520
and and and so forth then you know that

997
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,000
that might get us to a compromise but we

998
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,319
but we can't leave i don't think we we

999
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,079
can leave

1000
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,319
a bare throughput here and have it be

1001
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,759
different than 2544.

1002
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,240
so just uh raccoon just made a comment

1003
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,040
um saying that throughput is now defined

1004
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,880
in 7.1.3.4

1005
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,319
um maybe let's just scroll down to that

1006
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,400
one and see

1007
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,079
all right perhaps it's we can use the

1008
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,000
wording there and then

1009
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,760
um i'm

1010
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,280
not not uh entirely

1011
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,520
sure is there a reason we can't use the

1012
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,560
bmw g defined uh

1013
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,160
i'm i i

1014
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,720
i if we're going to be taking it and

1015
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,560
taking the input

1016
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,480
from the bmwg which i think we

1017
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,920
we would be fools not to um

1018
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,839
uh back to um our our internal working

1019
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,440
groups i just want to make sure we have

1020
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,880
a very clear

1021
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,720
um explanation as to

1022
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,400
where where the recommendation is coming

1023
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,000
from and why

1024
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
i just want to clarify why it's not

1025
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,880
possible to measure rfc 2544 for

1026
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,640
for firewall benchmarking test two

1027
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,839
reasons first

1028
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:45,839
rs22540 you explain

1029
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,839
frame for seconds frame rate not the

1030
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,440
beat per seconds

1031
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,760
for stateful firewall this is important

1032
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,920
the

1033
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,000
payload is very important not not the

1034
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,599
frame for seconds

1035
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,240
so that's why i i think rs25 for 2544 is

1036
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,880
mentioning

1037
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,359
frame for seconds but i think for the

1038
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,200
state for firewall we have to measure

1039
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,760
bit

1040
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,480
bitrate because the firewall is taking

1041
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,400
take a look taking look on the bits

1042
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,680
and packets payloads so it's important

1043
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,000
to

1044
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,760
so the bit rate than frame rate

1045
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,880
so this is one point the second point

1046
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,040
let me let's one thing the

1047
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,400
i'm going to circle back to that first

1048
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,480
one please go ahead i'm sorry the second

1049
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,440
point is the rsa2544 says okay

1050
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,520
you measure the throughput with zero

1051
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,560
packet loss

1052
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,200
right but you as you know this is layer

1053
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,440
7. there's a retransmission

1054
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,319
tcp and you of course you will see

1055
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,760
packet loss and then you have a

1056
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,960
retransmission

1057
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,880
this is slightly different than stateful

1058
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,640
stateless file or

1059
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,839
layer 3 layer 2 device testing so this

1060
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,119
is a little bit

1061
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,760
slightly different than 2544 test

1062
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,920
throughput test

1063
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,920
uh yeah i'm not arguing that um i'm

1064
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,200
and but but i will say that uh the rfc

1065
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,880
2544 throughput

1066
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,440
is used commonly also at the the packet

1067
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,319
layer

1068
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,720
uh but the results can be expressed in

1069
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,640
bits per second that's where we compare

1070
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,440
it with

1071
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,520
uh you know the maximum theoretical bit

1072
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,000
rates and frame rates and and so forth

1073
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,520
um we uh we we

1074
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,760
we just have to we just have to put the

1075
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,920
right story together here so that we

1076
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,960
don't have

1077
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,319
uh you know this overlapping uh single

1078
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:35,520
term

1079
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,040
which looks a lot like rfc

1080
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,440
2544 throughput and um

1081
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,160
you know if you're saying that that this

1082
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,800
is a

1083
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,960
uh you know kind of a layer for and

1084
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,160
above

1085
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,599
throughput a transport layer throughput

1086
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,760
then that's fine but

1087
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,880
it doesn't say that here

1088
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,480
i think the only only the problem is you

1089
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,760
see the throughput the rfc 264

1090
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,520
explaining not the throughput is

1091
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,800
explaining a

1092
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,920
bit per seconds so we just take the same

1093
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,359
definition

1094
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,079
the only the problem is if we change the

1095
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:20,960
title

1096
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,680
okay there you see bit per seconds as a

1097
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,520
kpi

1098
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,759
but in our draft you see throughput

1099
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,119
it's pretty

1100
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,760
that's the problem i'm trying to fix we

1101
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,440
can't say throughput alone here

1102
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,800
we've already got that term claimed

1103
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,280
and and it's a different definition

1104
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,319
you of course want consistency yeah and

1105
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,400
so that's why i'm pointing to

1106
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,040
uh if you're if you're thinking good put

1107
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,119
and and that's what you just explained

1108
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,240
uh bala with re-transmissions and losses

1109
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,119
that

1110
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,400
are are taken care of um you know that's

1111
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,680
fine

1112
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,920
and that's a term that was used in rfc

1113
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,520
3511 the previous

1114
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,920
firewall benchmarking rfc

1115
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,280
but that's it so i it sounds to me as

1116
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,000
though

1117
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and of course you can express good put

1118
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,960
in bits per second

1119
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,599
but but it sounds to me as though you

1120
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,480
really want to sit

1121
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,720
take a step back sit down and decide

1122
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,480
what you what you're really measuring

1123
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,839
here

1124
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,160
yes sir we will we need to talk

1125
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,079
internally the only the problem is good

1126
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,000
good put you have to eliminate all

1127
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,599
returns so yeah we are talking here

1128
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,119
stateful traffic right so

1129
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,400
mostly tcp so if you want to measure

1130
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,240
good put you need to eliminate all

1131
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,040
re-transmission retries and everything

1132
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,440
and the point is

1133
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,240
the system is complex not only the test

1134
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,480
and the device only the the test

1135
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,440
devices test equipment then we need to

1136
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,160
clarify

1137
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,240
make sure okay who is dropping packet or

1138
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
who is making free transmission

1139
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,920
and all kinds of things we need to

1140
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,400
eliminate in order to measure the good

1141
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,040
port

1142
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,440
so good put is the the traffic rate

1143
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,680
without any re-transmission

1144
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,598
uh delays and anything

1145
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,200
well it takes advantage of

1146
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,078
re-transmissions

1147
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,480
right so i think this is covered in 8238

1148
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,839
definition of application good put but

1149
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,040
i would like to think about

1150
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,200
the the majority of the readers what is

1151
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,960
the target audience

1152
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,520
so of course now somebody's calling me

1153
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,200
the target audience

1154
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,720
and the target audience is just the

1155
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,960
orderly guy

1156
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,240
or or a girl who just has an

1157
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:00,960
understanding

1158
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,359
an informal understanding of throughput

1159
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,520
so the question is isn't it possible to

1160
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,079
overload

1161
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,800
the term here for the purpose of this

1162
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,720
layer seven

1163
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,480
related document

1164
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,040
if if we if we if we put enough

1165
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,960
adjectives in front of it

1166
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,640
karsten then we've got something to talk

1167
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,880
about um

1168
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,640
okay in other words that would be an

1169
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,119
idea to say application throughput

1170
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,559
yeah and then use that term consistently

1171
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,880
throughout the document

1172
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,720
right because the other thing is i mean

1173
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,040
the term throughput has been used a lot

1174
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,760
you know but

1175
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,480
i'm i'm actually not sure where is the

1176
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,839
official

1177
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,599
definition that would be whether that

1178
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,440
would claim to be valid across

1179
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,720
all bmw ge documents

1180
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,760
it's in um well it's the definition

1181
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,559
is in two places uh actually three

1182
00:48:58,559 --> 00:48:59,839
places

1183
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,520
actually four places it's in rfc 1242

1184
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,200
1242 it is in

1185
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,880
uh 1944 uh

1186
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,480
that's the original version of of 2544

1187
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,319
and it and actually the wording is

1188
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,880
correct in

1189
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,200
1944 uh because something went wrong

1190
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,400
in the editing process uh and the

1191
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,200
definition

1192
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,480
in uh 2544 is missing some words and

1193
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,640
so the fourth and final place where the

1194
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,160
definition exists

1195
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,559
is in the errata for uh rfc 2544

1196
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,400
where i pointed out that something went

1197
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,000
wrong in the editing process and the

1198
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,280
full definition

1199
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,119
is also for rc 2544 is in the errata

1200
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,920
that for this is all for 25 uh rfc 2544

1201
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,960
throughput so

1202
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,480
yeah there's a long history here we're

1203
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,079
carrying some baggage

1204
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,440
um a lot of it you know a lot of this

1205
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,880
took place before

1206
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,240
i got very active here in in 2003

1207
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,880
uh but i but i'm responsible for

1208
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,680
noticing the

1209
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,559
mistake and and entering the errata i'll

1210
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,920
take credit for that

1211
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,280
uh nevertheless um we

1212
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,280
you know we've in in our context

1213
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,400
um and and and this is a standard as

1214
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,280
much as anything

1215
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,800
in in our in our industry this is

1216
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,040
this is the definition we use you know

1217
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,000
they're there

1218
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,119
surely there are lots of other ways to

1219
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,760
define this but within our working group

1220
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,640
we've got a good

1221
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,440
solid foundation to stand on and and if

1222
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:41,839
we

1223
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,960
if we get close to that um uh with

1224
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,760
another term

1225
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,920
let's let's clarify it with with at

1226
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,880
least one

1227
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,040
really uh useful adjective

1228
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,400
i think that would be a good way to go

1229
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,119
so uh uh i'll al carson uh uh bella

1230
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,960
brian if i can add this magic here

1231
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,280
i think this work uh first firstly

1232
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,160
thanks very much for

1233
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,760
for driving it as i said in my email

1234
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,520
excellent work and i think this is an

1235
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,119
opportunity for us to

1236
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,400
actually uh

1237
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,960
standardize on nomenclature exactly as

1238
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,400
carson you said

1239
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,119
because making it complicated for the

1240
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,400
for the for the users

1241
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,160
it's not gonna help anybody um and uh

1242
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,800
just a quick example in uh in the normal

1243
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,240
you know packet blasting

1244
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,319
tests um we use in our in our tests the

1245
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,079
rfc 2504 nomenclature but but we

1246
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,160
we quote throughput in in bits per

1247
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,960
second and also in packets per second

1248
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,160
here we're clearly dealing with a

1249
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,319
stateful traffic

1250
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,800
so we are after something related to

1251
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,200
transactions and transaction throughput

1252
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,520
and we have transactions per seconds um

1253
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,880
and we have you know connections per

1254
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,240
seconds and other metrics

1255
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,240
so um it would be good to use this it's

1256
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,520
an excellent opportunity to actually

1257
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,640
look at

1258
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,079
at uh at uh defining this

1259
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,599
uh term uh well so that there is no

1260
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,119
no ambiguity for stateful uh traffic and

1261
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:15,760
uh the

1262
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,240
the the only issue here is that

1263
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,800
independently on what functions are

1264
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,040
performed on the on the packet flows

1265
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,119
there will be quite huge dependencies

1266
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,000
on the not only the packet size but also

1267
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,200
the protocols used

1268
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,119
right whether it's tcp quick and

1269
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,400
and and and so on so

1270
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,559
there will be always a number of i think

1271
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,480
adjectives plus

1272
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,200
protocols or or some other metadata

1273
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
associated with the

1274
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,760
with the performance metric word whether

1275
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,119
it's throughput or

1276
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,599
or transaction throughput or something

1277
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:53,200
but it'll be good to have that clarified

1278
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:53,520
here

1279
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,200
and i think this is this is exactly the

1280
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,079
place uh this draft

1281
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,520
so that's great good thank you i i think

1282
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,000
that's a

1283
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,960
that's a decent summary of um what we

1284
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,839
talked about

1285
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,400
and and the next steps and anything

1286
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,240
further on this topic it's an important

1287
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:10,640
one

1288
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,599
obviously um to the working group and

1289
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,400
and

1290
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,520
and to the world at large

1291
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,160
um i would like to point to two parts of

1292
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,280
this definition

1293
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,119
which are not included in to my

1294
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,880
knowledge in any other

1295
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,359
throughput definition the first one is

1296
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,040
the word allowed

1297
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,880
so for security devices there is a

1298
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,160
difference between

1299
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,000
traffic that could be forwarded and

1300
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,359
traffic that's allowed

1301
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,440
okay maybe that's not so much a problem

1302
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,640
the other problem is

1303
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,280
the correct destination interface so in

1304
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
load balancing or any other kind of

1305
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,520
layer 7 device

1306
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,040
it's important that the traffic doesn't

1307
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,200
just arrive but it's

1308
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,040
it's actually forwarded on the correct

1309
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,200
output port

1310
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,919
egressport

1311
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,200
those are those are great points

1312
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,839
the question is you know do you would

1313
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:06,640
you suggest

1314
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,559
al or anybody to to reference

1315
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,559
a definition of throughput and then

1316
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:13,920
supplement it

1317
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,079
as we've tried here or should we

1318
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,839
just ignore the differences in the

1319
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,520
definition the definition and say

1320
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,240
we we say whether it's allowed traffic

1321
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:24,960
or not

1322
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,720
is okay whether it arrives at the

1323
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,079
correct us board or not

1324
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,280
okay or what should we do or do you find

1325
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,319
something completely different

1326
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,920
throughput which is the firewall

1327
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,680
throughput

1328
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,920
right right yes so actually

1329
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,480
we've got we've got the terms correct

1330
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,079
destination here in the old

1331
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,280
uh good uh definition so that's uh

1332
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,280
that's a that's a good start

1333
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,799
and then um you know you you you have to

1334
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:58,240
you basically have to uh decide

1335
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,799
where in the you know where in the stack

1336
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,319
uh this definition is

1337
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,640
going to exist at what layer you have to

1338
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,079
nail that down

1339
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,200
and um uh and and

1340
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,359
i i think your point about allowed

1341
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,880
permitted traffic

1342
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,440
uh this is the you know that picks up

1343
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,799
the aspect of

1344
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:19,760
um you know the firewall operation where

1345
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,000
it's

1346
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,280
going to be tossing away uh traffic

1347
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,680
potentially while you're trying to

1348
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,880
forward uh

1349
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,280
allowed traffic so those and those are

1350
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,480
the kinds of tests that people are

1351
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:31,440
interested in

1352
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,520
so i'm sorry that was i think that was

1353
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,960
masiak trying to get in here too

1354
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,319
yeah so carson just stimulated my

1355
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,680
my uh uh my my thinking uh here uh

1356
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,440
the you know clearly as expressed

1357
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,599
earlier um i think it was either balor

1358
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:46,559
or brian

1359
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:49,119
uh we're dealing here with quite complex

1360
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,240
um

1361
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,119
packet processing functions uh deployed

1362
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:53,599
on those

1363
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,200
on those devices or appliances so

1364
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,400
the um and i think i mentioned this in

1365
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:00,799
my

1366
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,160
my comments but i didn't really get to

1367
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,319
the bottom of it because i clearly run

1368
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,280
out of time

1369
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,599
so the the presence or not of cves which

1370
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,079
is

1371
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,040
very well handled in the draft so the

1372
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,920
throughput or

1373
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,839
you know we were actually measuring

1374
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,599
performance here and this performance of

1375
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,119
you know clean traffic and also

1376
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,319
performance

1377
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,880
under um under attack right with with

1378
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,599
avc's

1379
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,720
uh with cv is there so

1380
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,960
uh there will be a cve dependency and

1381
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,079
carson as you said

1382
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:32,720
um you know is is what does matter the

1383
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,160
permit throughput

1384
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,040
um and and the deny actions are are

1385
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,160
ignored

1386
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,559
um i mean they all they all matter and

1387
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,839
so

1388
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,040
so somehow um that the

1389
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,319
performance slash efficiency definition

1390
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,920
should capture that we're dealing with

1391
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,839
the security devices that are filtering

1392
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,520
the good from bad

1393
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,240
um and and the definition should capture

1394
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:56,640
that

1395
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,720
somehow this is not just you know

1396
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,319
dropping packet

1397
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:02,240
due to the capacity issue it's not the

1398
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,640
only uh

1399
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,720
action that we're measuring here we're

1400
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,359
actually measuring the response to

1401
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:14,400
the uh the the malicious traffic

1402
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,319
yeah so there's that's very good so

1403
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,640
there's there's absolutely some aspects

1404
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,119
of this definition that are unique

1405
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,640
uh that we want to retain and that we

1406
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,400
want to differentiate

1407
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,000
from the rfc 2544 throughput

1408
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,440
in our definition in in all of its forms

1409
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,799
i think that's the uh that's the summary

1410
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,680
of where we are at the moment

1411
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,599
so in order to avoid avoid us or like

1412
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,839
us meaning like the folks from the

1413
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,599
netsec open side and the folks from the

1414
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,720
bmw

1415
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,079
site going back and forth on this um i'm

1416
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,640
wondering whether it would be useful

1417
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,160
to have a a call

1418
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,559
with a small group of people so like i'm

1419
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:03,599
thinking magic

1420
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,040
and maybe someone else or a couple of

1421
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,960
others from the benchmark working group

1422
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,240
side who's interested

1423
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,079
and then some from folks from the netsec

1424
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,920
open side so we could just

1425
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,119
nail this and uh sort of get get

1426
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,440
something where we all agree and then

1427
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,480
we'll put it

1428
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,440
you know write up a a draft definition

1429
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,520
circulated amongst everybody

1430
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,000
and get everybody to bless it and then

1431
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,440
put it in the document i think

1432
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,680
that might be a more efficient way of

1433
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,760
doing it

1434
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,839
yeah i mean i don't think it i don't

1435
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,200
think we we need a

1436
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,319
interim meeting for that necessarily um

1437
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,880
as long as everybody as long as any

1438
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,720
everybody from bmwg

1439
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,920
who's interested is is uh allowed to

1440
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,200
attend

1441
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,960
oh yeah no there would be no there would

1442
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,480
be no limitation

1443
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,359
if somebody somebody wanted to attend

1444
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,880
it's great but you know as well as i do

1445
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,440
that

1446
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,920
smaller the number the more effective uh

1447
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,680
the results will be

1448
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,799
yeah yeah so but uh you know i'm i'm

1449
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,200
just trying to avoid the overhead of an

1450
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,559
of an interim meeting when we're

1451
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,079
basically going to be talking about one

1452
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,720
definition

1453
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,480
and and i think that's i think that's

1454
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,760
fairly reasonable it's

1455
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,839
you know it's really just a bunch of

1456
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:19,839
knowledgeable people getting together

1457
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:22,880
uh each each side uh of

1458
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,920
perspectives uh expressing their views

1459
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,000
and and then uh and then as you say

1460
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,359
brian nail it

1461
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,599
that's you know go away and get it right

1462
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,760
that's what we're talking about here

1463
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,119
basically yeah so

1464
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,200
so that's i think that's i think that's

1465
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,160
a good good

1466
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,599
a good way forward on on this uh

1467
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,440
does anybody have any objection to

1468
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,280
proceeding in that way to

1469
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,680
have an informal call at a reasonable

1470
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:50,799
hour where

1471
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,760
um you know where we hope anyone who has

1472
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,599
a strong interest in this topic

1473
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:57,440
and and basically there were five of us

1474
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,960
who spoke up today

1475
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,480
uh six on on all the topics of this

1476
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,440
draft

1477
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,119
uh but plenty of people who've made

1478
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,799
comments along the way and might want to

1479
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:07,520
join us

1480
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,559
so i mean it's a it's a small but very

1481
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:11,599
interested group

1482
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,760
and and i think that would keep in deep

1483
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,440
within the manageable size

1484
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,760
and then of course any you know any

1485
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,280
preliminary agreement it's going to be

1486
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,720
reported back to the group

1487
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,000
both in the context of uh like a like an

1488
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,359
email status

1489
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:28,640
and updated words to the draft and then

1490
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,960
working group review that follows so

1491
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,960
it's it's um

1492
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,200
you know nothing's going to happen here

1493
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,480
without um

1494
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,920
full access to the information

1495
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,119
just looking for the brain trust away in

1496
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,400
yeah yeah

1497
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,240
and i have to confess it will be very

1498
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,760
helpful for me to hear additional

1499
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:50,559
perspectives

1500
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,680
too and i hope everyone is open to that

1501
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,839
that opportunity

1502
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,599
robert raises him al i think robert

1503
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,880
raised his hand for

1504
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,440
oh we did okay i've got stuff covered up

1505
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,480
here uh

1506
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,520
uh go robert um yes

1507
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,440
so obviously i don't know this

1508
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,960
technology very well but i

1509
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,640
i do want to share the fact that the

1510
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,079
comments that i think a couple you're

1511
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,119
making of

1512
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,920
um this should be a different term as in

1513
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,280
at least it should have some adjective

1514
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,520
to describe the throughput is different

1515
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,559
i think that is key and although it's

1516
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:27,440
hard to speak

1517
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,079
for what the isg would do during review

1518
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,920
i suspect if you've tried to re

1519
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,760
redefine throughput in this document to

1520
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,200
have a different meaning

1521
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,319
i suspect that that would cause angst

1522
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,000
within the isg review so

1523
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,200
um it doesn't have to be a completely

1524
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
different word but at least uh

1525
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
making sure that it is quite clearly

1526
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,880
different i think would be a good thing

1527
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,079
to achieve

1528
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,839
uh having a meeting to discuss this

1529
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:50,720
going forward that sounds like a good

1530
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,119
idea

1531
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,200
a good idea to me but just to phrase

1532
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,400
that

1533
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,640
that that's that's good that sounds that

1534
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,000
sounds supportive of the

1535
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,920
general direction we're going and and

1536
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,599
also um

1537
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:04,079
you know as a reminder to everyone uh

1538
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:04,640
which is

1539
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,480
something which rob is is very familiar

1540
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,760
with uh

1541
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,119
you know the the iesg sometimes has uh

1542
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,559
uh people on the the committee that

1543
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,359
on the group um who've done a lot done a

1544
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,039
significant amount of benchmarking

1545
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,599
and and and from that experience they go

1546
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,240
oh what the hell are you guys doing here

1547
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,960
so uh you know we're our work is often

1548
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:27,359
looked

1549
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,079
on looked in on uh at the very last

1550
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:30,960
stage

1551
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,000
uh by very knowledgeable people and um

1552
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,480
uh performance measurement experts and

1553
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,119
so forth

1554
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,920
who only get to weigh in at that point

1555
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,599
and um you know we have to be ready to

1556
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:42,160
defend

1557
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,520
what we what we decide uh

1558
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,920
that only serves to help make the final

1559
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,520
result better

1560
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,280
yeah yeah that's exactly right

1561
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,039
good all right um

1562
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,319
so brian you've got uh

1563
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,760
i think that was the last one on this

1564
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,000
one you've got a few more uh

1565
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,319
topics on on this uh highlight of

1566
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:07,440
changes here

1567
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,640
so uh yeah you know good so

1568
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,240
the changes to uh the actual test cases

1569
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,920
uh 7.1 through 7.9 the

1570
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,319
basic intent and uh process was

1571
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,119
unchanged

1572
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,039
you know any anything that we changed

1573
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,680
there were for clarity's sake

1574
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,799
uh we added the ayanna considerations

1575
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,839
um text that uh wasn't

1576
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,880
wasn't in in section 8 previously

1577
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,000
and then we added the associated rfcs

1578
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,039
that we referenced

1579
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,319
to uh section 12.2

1580
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,720
informative references and then we moved

1581
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,319
um

1582
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,880
we moved uh the set uh

1583
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:53,039
classifications um that uh we previously

1584
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,319
had in section four

1585
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,680
into appendix b and and so on because it

1586
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,920
wasn't applicable across the board so

1587
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,960
it just made more sense to uh to make it

1588
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,799
um an appendix good

1589
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,720
and that's that's pretty much it i mean

1590
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,480
if you take a look at diff

1591
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,720
diff 2 you'll see all the whole work

1592
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,000
that we did so

1593
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,240
oh yeah yeah tons of tons of work there

1594
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,200
and um

1595
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,079
much appreciated so yeah and and i

1596
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:20,640
really

1597
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,960
you know speaking on behalf of um all

1598
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,960
the folks on the netsec open side that

1599
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,520
that worked on this the input that we've

1600
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,440
received and that we anticipate

1601
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,799
receiving going forward

1602
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:34,880
is great and i i think it will really

1603
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,839
really in the long term work out that

1604
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:39,599
we'll have a much more solid document

1605
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,039
that i think will survive

1606
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,839
the test of time

1607
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,200
great well i'm glad they're the netsec

1608
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,520
open community uh who has contributed so

1609
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,319
much to this

1610
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,359
is uh also uh open to the

1611
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:57,039
um the wider review here that's

1612
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,319
that's what we've been trying to get

1613
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,400
going all along and um

1614
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,480
as as far as the next steps go we've got

1615
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,839
the uh

1616
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:07,039
we've got sarah's review uh we've got

1617
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,240
um to work on on throughput

1618
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,960
uh definition with an adjective uh the

1619
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,799
something something throughput

1620
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,680
and we've uh got to get some additional

1621
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:18,160
review

1622
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,839
uh by by folks if if you um if any

1623
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,079
interest has been peaked today by uh by

1624
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:26,400
these discussions and and the topics

1625
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,440
uh because this is uh um and we're gonna

1626
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,400
nail down that

1627
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,680

right now

1643
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,799
should i put should i post um yeah kind

1644
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:09,280
of

1645
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,200
hate the idea of saying this but should

1646
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,280
i um should i post

1647
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:18,160
um to the bwg mailing list um an invite

1648
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,240
to the meeting or is that just asking

1649
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,720
for yeah yeah no i think that's i think

1650
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,839
that's fine i i

1651
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:27,039
i i think that that

1652
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,960
we should be open as possible and i

1653
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,559
don't think we're gonna get uh

1654
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,400
you know a tremendous overage that would

1655
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,920
um mess up our conference

1656
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,599
now you're right you're absolutely right

1657
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,280
being open and transparent as possible

1658
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,920
is the right way to do it

1659
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,520
uh and so um let's let's have those

1660
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,839
let's have those uh steps that i've

1661
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,039
mentioned um

1662
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:54,400
and we'll uh before the next draft is

1663
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,599
published

1664
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,400
and then uh when the next draft is

1665
01:06:58,400 --> 01:06:59,280
published

1666
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,400
then we'll do a working group last call

1667
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,880
which will hopefully finish it up hey

1668
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,680
sarah how long do you think it'll um

1669
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:12,799
take you to go through the the 50 odd

1670
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:14,240
pages

1671
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,359
i think it's a day per page brian so

1672
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,400
uh can you give me a couple no no

1673
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,599
um can i have uh i will do it as soon as

1674
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,599

1675
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:27,280
in all honesty i was gonna have somebody

1676
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,640
on my qa team here

1677
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,799
at work take a look as well because it's

1678
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,240
something great

1679
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,480
so um you know if you can a week

1680

1681
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,039
do my very best to get my review in this

1682
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:40,079

1684
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,720

01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,680
masiak uh in the queue we've we've done

1689
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,520
i've done a bad job of

1690
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,640
managing the mic line here today but

1691
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,640
uh every i think everyone's been heard

1692
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,200
that wanted to be heard go ahead masiak

1693
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,280

1694
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:06,799
my hand earlier and i was brought again

1695
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,799
so apologies for that now i'm

1696
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,400
following the discipline in my client

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,559
and i was waiting patiently thank you al

1698
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,760
um i have um uh i actually have

1699
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,640
uh one or two uh generic comments if

1700
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,080
this is a good time because we're gonna

1701
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,120
leave this uh this

1702
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,399
this draft now correct yeah i think if

1703
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,920
you can if you can just do that in five

1704
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,399
minutes

1705
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:29,279
uh that will be great uh okay so i will

1706
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,719
not be uh yeah i am

1707
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,839
uh sometimes taking time but i'll keep

1708
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:34,799
it short so

1709
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,000
the um uh one question

1710
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
i have is and i'm not sure i asked it in

1711
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,679
the in my review

1712
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:44,960
uh this is about uh security devices

1713
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,319
appliances but

1714
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,640
is the aim here also to address the

1715
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,600
virtualized

1716
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,960
or or cloud-based security offerings

1717
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,560
we are starting to look at that yes

1718
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,479
so do you think um so it is the target

1719
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:04,198
for the draft directly or well

1720
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:07,759
tangentially um i i'm not

1721
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,960
um i'm we're going into looking at this

1722
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:11,839
with uh

1723
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:14,799
with uh an expectation that things might

1724
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:16,000
have to change

1725
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,238
um that may lead to a requirement to

1726
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:19,198
have uh

1727
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,479
to have a new draft but um or our new

1728
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:25,759
a new rfc but um we haven't reached that

1729
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:26,238
point yet

1730
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:28,000
when i said we're just starting to think

1731
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,439
about it uh

1732
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:32,560
i do mean just okay

1733
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,198
so because if it does then uh this draft

1734
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:35,679
should be

1735
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,520
acting as a foundation all right at

1736
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,799
least that's my

1737
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,640
that's my thing it's something to build

1738
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,238
on there is a lot of new

1739
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:44,960
network as a service this marketing

1740
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,319
sassy things

1741
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,960
uh secure access secure edge and it

1742
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,479
network security generally became

1743
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,319
a much bigger thing than before due to

1744
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,480
covet and number of people

1745
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,000
um uh living online so uh work life and

1746
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:58,800
so on so

1747
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,040
okay so thanks very much because there's

1748
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,800
a direct impact there on sizing

1749
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,880
as the current sizing and i think i

1750
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,920
raised that

1751
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:08,320
is is clearly focusing on on physical

1752
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,840
appliances but maybe that's something to

1753
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,960
keep in mind

1754
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,960
the other one um is the comment i

1755
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,719
made and i guess i i still need to

1756
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,159
finish the

1757
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,719
the checking uh because uh and uh

1758
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:22,000
because you actually did

1759
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,440
uh um address uh most of most most of my

1760
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:26,800
comments so thank you very much for that

1761
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,600
i

1762
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,640
but there are a few uh loose ends which

1763
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,360
i guess my questions or points were not

1764
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:33,840
very

1765
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,600
uh specific or specific enough

1766
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,239
and that is the the features that are

1767
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,560
recommended to be configured

1768
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,280
so um i guess i'm going to revisit this

1769
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:45,920
point

1770
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,440
and uh and clarify further on

1771
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,360
what is the recommendation recommended

1772
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,719
versus optional and

1773
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,640
and and the use of the word you know

1774
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,000
should consistently

1775
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,360
be enabled um because ips is always

1776
01:10:59,360 --> 01:10:59,760
there

1777
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,199
and um and if people take that and this

1778
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:04,719
is the baseline that ips

1779
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,400
is always there that exclude cases where

1780
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,320
ips is not there

1781
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,760
so so so the purpose the purpose of our

1782
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,320
recommendations when it comes to

1783
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,880
the features being considered was not

1784
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,280
necessarily to test

1785
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,880
stringently the security the

1786
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,960
effectiveness of these features

1787
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,239
the the goal was to ensure that the

1788
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:29,760
features were enabled

1789
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,840
that we verified that they are acting

1790
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,440
and running in a manner that we would

1791
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,960
expect

1792
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,760
we being the testers would expect and

1793
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,159
then

1794
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,480
um leave them on during during the

1795
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,239
performance testing

1796
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:46,000
and um so you know we're we're not

1797
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,880
we were not looking to make this um a

1798
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:49,920
document that

1799
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,120
uh was an exhaustive um

1800
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:57,199
security efficacy test

1801
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,280
okay

1802
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:04,719
okay so i guess i'm going to revisit and

1803
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:06,640
reread that

1804
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,800
because that's not the uh and i guess i

1805
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:11,360
included this in my in my comments uh

1806
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,560
um and and if there is any scope for

1807
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:16,159
for mentioning that you know some of

1808
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,480
those features or any of those features

1809
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,520
could be uh tested in in isolation in

1810
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,440
terms of measuring their efficiency but

1811
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,719
let me think about that and i'll come

1812
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,040
back to you with uh with comments and i

1813
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,560
understand that

1814
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,120
uh there is time for uh completing the

1815
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,400
review because i actually

1816
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,239
only skimmed through section seven one

1817
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:35,679
which was good but i would like to spend

1818
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,120
a bit more time on that

1819
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,840
so so i understand that there is a time

1820
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,040
for that before the next revision or

1821
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,000
or is that not the case

1822
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,840
um

1823
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,800
we welcome we welcome comments and um

1824
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:55,840
suggestions

1825
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:58,880
um some things we as

1826
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,159
as evidenced by how we responded to your

1827
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:04,000
previous comments there will be some

1828
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,400
that we think make a lot of sense and

1829
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,080
that we will change

1830
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,480
um but with respect to the test cases

1831
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,760
seven one through seven

1832
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,880
nine um you know it's

1833
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,679
it's going to be a a reasonably high bar

1834
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:18,880
that we'll need to

1835
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,920
um discuss with you in order to

1836
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,080
uh to make changes in in that area if

1837
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,520
it's going to affect

1838
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,679
the tests themselves the execution of

1839
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:28,719
the tests i

1840
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,800
i don't expect i don't expect that

1841
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,000
because the content

1842
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,880
is already my you know the best thing

1843
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,760
i've ever seen

1844
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,440
uh written down so uh but um

1845
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,440
okay all right but i get a point uh

1846
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,280
brian so um

1847
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,440
we'll i will do my best to turn

1848
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,560
throughout this as

1849
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,560
soon as possible oh great thank you

1850
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,600
great thanks a lot magic

1851
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:54,800
right okay

1852
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,040
so we we've we've got our next steps

1853
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,239
we've got a couple of additional

1854
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:59,040
comments

1855
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,080
and um uh

1856
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,239
assuming all that's uh been captured in

1857
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,280
the notes we'll get it out to the

1858
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,719
mailing list very shortly

1859
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,159
um brian bala karsten uh

1860
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:12,960
thank you so much for your efforts again

1861
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,120
like you said thank you

1862
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,560
and we'll we'll now move on to the next

1863
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,280
topic if that's okay actually um the

1864
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,239
next topic

1865
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:25,199
is um

1866
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,960
is uh the multi oh

1867
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,440
gosh multi multi-loss ratio uh search

1868
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,440
and i want to make what do i want to do

1869
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,760
here i'll make this bigger

1870
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,320
and and i saw so um maciac and

1871
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,120
uh veraco uh which one is it is it you

1872
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,280
masiak who's going to present this

1873
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,880
or voraco oh oh of rocco's here yeah

1874
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,159
it's you racco um i i

1875
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:57,840
i i need to beg uh a two minute health

1876
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,760
break here if you want you can start

1877
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,679
um start slowly uh but i will be right

1878
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,080
back okay

1879
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:08,560
okay i think we can wait two minutes

1880
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,000
yeah yeah that's what i thought

1881
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:25,840
so two minute health break everybody

1882
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,840
hmm

1883
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,360
all right okay i'm i'm

1884
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:44,080
back and it's uh if i guess if you start

1885
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:46,159
slowly uh viretco you will

1886
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,000
pick up anyone who anyone else who

1887
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,199
needed a health break

1888
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:53,040
thank you for waiting okay so

1889
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,640
hello i'm rocco black i'm presenting

1890
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,480
an update on this draft mlr search means

1891
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,840
multiple loss ratio search and

1892
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,159
now i see that it is not mentioned

1893
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,840
anywhere in this presentation so

1894
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,880
hopefully next meeting it will be

1895
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,920
somewhere there the draft status is the

1896
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,960
important thing and

1897
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,679
first of all the draft was adapted that

1898
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:20,400
means that

1899
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,920
now it has different file name with a

1900
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,640
different

1901
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,120
version number but otherwise the

1902
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,239
contents have

1903
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,960
not changed in any meaningful way my

1904
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:31,440
plan

1905
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,360
was to prepare some changes for this

1906
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:34,560
meeting but i have

1907
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,199
run out of time so there are some

1908
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,560
changes but they are

1909
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,040
not yet turned into the next version of

1910
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,159
the draft

1911
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,520
they will be soon but not just today

1912
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,480
so this presentation i will be spending

1913
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:48,800
some

1914
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,400
time describing what the changes are and

1915
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,679
why i think they are needed

1916
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,800
and of course we welcome more

1917
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,920
reviews i think we can jump

1918
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,120
to the slide number seven the slides in

1919
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,159
between are just

1920
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:09,199
recycling the older presentations useful

1921
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:10,719
for people who are not there

1922
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,120
or are not familiar we can go back if

1923
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:13,920
there are some

1924
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,960
specific questions but this is the

1925
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,239
important thing so

1926
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,960
here i am describing a situation that i

1927
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:23,920
have encountered

1928
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,640
where the old logic is not very

1929
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,800
efficient

1930
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,920
this leads to the search taking

1931
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,520
longer to to give a final

1932
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,480
result and there is one number

1933
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,400
highlighted in red

1934
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,159
these three lines and third line from

1935
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,600
the bottom

1936
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,280
this is too low because

1937
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,320
there was a measurement done at 11

1938
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,600
which when it is considered it will be

1939
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,640
clear that we

1940
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,800
the algorithm does not need to measure

1941
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,719
this law but the previous logic

1942
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,600
was short-sighted and didn't see this

1943
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,239
implication

1944
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:04,480
so it was doing more measurements that

1945
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,480
were necessary

1946
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,080
so this is like

1947
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:14,000
uh this is a fake result i do not have a

1948
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,480
real round with real numbers uh to show

1949
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,520
this

1950
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,719
behavior but at least the numbers are

1951
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:23,760
easier easier to follow so

1952
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,760
sure you can go to the next slide

1953
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,679
where i describe the improvements

1954
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,600
initially my idea was to just

1955
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,040
make the draft

1956
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,400
obviously be able to support

1957
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,640
multiple multiple loss

1958
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,000
ratio goals because the currently

1959
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,199
it focuses on just two goals one goal is

1960
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:56,400
exactly zero loss which leads to ndr no

1961
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,840
drop rate and the other one is some zero

1962
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,960
small ratio which leads to pdr partial

1963
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,199
drop rate uh it is obvious

1964
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:09,120
for me at least that the previous logic

1965
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,239
can be

1966
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,600
generalized to support any number of

1967
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,000
ratios but it wasn't not clear from the

1968
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:16,800
previous text

1969
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,600
how it should be generalized but then i

1970
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:20,480
encountered

1971
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,920
this one inefficiency so

1972
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,199
i endeavored to fix this inefficiency

1973
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:31,360
while doing the change from fixed to

1974
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,400
configure the number of loss ratio

1975
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,679
goals and

1976
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:41,280
the main change is that

1977
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,800
contrary to the previous version i mean

1978
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,400
currently published version there is no

1979
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,199
coupling between which measurement

1980
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:51,920
belongs to

1981
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,360
which ratio because in the external

1982
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:55,760
search

1983
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,840
this can change we have seen that

1984
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,159
previously

1985
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,400
measurement result that looks unrelated

1986
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,000
turned out to be related

1987
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,280
so the main change is that

1988
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,560
now there is

1989
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,880
quality quantum database that holds all

1990
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,080
the results

1991
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:18,159
at least for the particular

1992
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,480
measurement duration and the

1993
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,679
the fact which of those results

1994
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:30,800
are acting as upper bound or lower bound

1995
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:35,040
for a particular ratio is computed

1996
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,520
in the runtime after each new result so

1997
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,840
this way even old and

1998
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,960
it's basically we

1999
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:49,040
avoid the previous situation even

2000
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,239
measurements that

2001
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,960
when they were done looked unrelated now

2002
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,440
they

2003
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:56,320
can become related based on this

2004
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,679
computation during ground type

2005
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:02,159
there are some technicalities for

2006
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,239
example

2007
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,320
i am now introducing effective loss

2008
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,080
ratio this is to

2009
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,360
avoid false decisions when

2010
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,920
measurement at higher rate leads to

2011
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:14,400
lower

2012
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,760
loss ratio because the intention

2013
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,719
is still to be conservative in the

2014
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:21,199
search

2015
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:25,839
so if this so-called

2016
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,639
ratio loss inversion happens we do not

2017
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:29,199
trust

2018
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,480
those lower loss ratios and we assume

2019
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,718
they are the same as the

2020
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,600
next smaller

2021
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,760
rate and this is the example

2022
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,360
yeah i think i have there is a link

2023
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,239
for the code so that people can check

2024
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:50,800
how

2025
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,400
exactly the current logic looks like uh

2026
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,800
i still do not have a good enough

2027
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:57,920
english description

2028
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,040
uh how exactly does it look like

2029
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,239
mainly related to what happens when you

2030
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:04,639
start

2031
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:07,840
new phase and you do not have all the

2032
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,880
bounds at the current duration how do

2033
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,280
you

2034
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,040
use the results from the previous

2035
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,760
duration that is

2036
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,320
not yet put into the words correctly

2037
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,199
this is the

2038
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,600
thing that i have already implemented in

2039
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,159
the code so it is there i just need to

2040
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:26,719
describe it in english so the next

2041
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:28,800
version is ready

2042
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:33,520
okay so this next slide shows

2043
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,080
what happens with the new logic and you

2044
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:36,719
can see

2045
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,760
there is green number 11 this is what

2046
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,239
the new logic does it realizes that

2047
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:47,199
previously unrelated measurement now

2048
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:48,719
works as a valid bound

2049
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:51,760
so the search

2050
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,360
ends more quickly and by the way it

2051
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,159
gives a different result that is because

2052
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,600
the

2053
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,520
the duty is not behaving deterministic

2054
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,560
in a deterministic way but there is no

2055
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,000
easy way

2056
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,520
to deal with it with this framework

2057
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,520
i believe this is a good solution to

2058
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,280
have equally

2059
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,560
valid result even if it is different

2060
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,719
when the this result comes sooner

2061
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,600
so i think this is the important

2062
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,960
change yeah yeah

2063
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,040
it'll it'll be it'll be interesting to

2064
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,719
see how how you um

2065
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,520
how you handled the device as you put it

2066
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,040
the device under test

2067
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,400
uh be performing in a non-uh

2068
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,719
deterministic way with respect to

2069
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:48,159
increasing load

2070
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:51,360
i mean this is this is the problem uh

2071
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,960
you know we recognized uh between

2072
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,000
um physical devices where we're

2073
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,480
pretty much able to get rid of the uh

2074
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,239
transient problems

2075
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:06,080
um and and then the uh

2076
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,239
you know our virtualized versions of the

2077
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:09,600
same devices

2078
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:12,400
where where transients come around and

2079
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:13,120
they

2080
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,600
they are a necessary part of operation

2081
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,239
but they

2082
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:19,840
they bother our uh our our longer term

2083
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:20,800
searching

2084
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,960
um and and kind of give us a clue that

2085
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,080
the resource limitation answer is is

2086
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,960
below a certain load level uh when in

2087
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,880
fact uh no that was just a transient

2088
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:31,840
that happened

2089
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,880
and uh the resource limitation is

2090
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,679
actually above

2091
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,880
here somewhere uh we've

2092
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,400
you know we've attacked that problem a

2093
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,159
couple of different ways now i think and

2094
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,920
it'll be interesting to see what your

2095
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:46,719
solution is here thanks

2096
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,960
yeah so for this particular algorithm

2097
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,719
uh my goal is to

2098
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,280
optimize the search logic so the

2099
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:57,920
algorithm

2100
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,960
never finds any consistencies and thinks

2101
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,000
uh

2102
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,560
everything is good of course this does

2103
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,440
not happen because

2104
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,120
the algorithm starts with shorter

2105
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,639
durations and then need to remeasure

2106
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,239
with longer durations

2107
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:13,440
so here you can see the pdr after

2108
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,120
five measurement five second

2109
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,360
measurements uh was between 15 and 16

2110
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,080
and

2111
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,120
then in 30 seconds it was forced to

2112
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:25,440
concede it is lower so this will always

2113
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:28,639
well this can always happens and

2114
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,600
sometimes this happens reliably for

2115
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,719
example if

2116
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,440
there is some interrupt that is periodic

2117
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,839
in time

2118
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,639
right it may be impossible for the 30

2119
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:41,840
second measurement to not

2120
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,440
encounter this interrupt and the

2121
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,199
previously good result which was lucky

2122
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:52,239
now can never be achieved after

2123
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:56,080
any repetitions and so on so this

2124
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,560
algorithm is prepared for this the

2125
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,760
improvement is

2126
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,760
that things

2127
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,360
only get more stable within one

2128
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,320
specific phase so uh when we switch from

2129
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:11,199
five seconds to

2130
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,840
30 seconds things can break but they

2131
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,639
will

2132
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,199
not break as badly as previously because

2133
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:18,159
previously

2134
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:21,360
the search for pdr has broken

2135
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,080
the previously stabilized search for ndr

2136
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,440
which is

2137
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,840
the inefficiency we want to avoid so

2138
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:28,719
with this new

2139
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:32,239
logic we will avoid it but the algorithm

2140
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:35,280
still needs to be prepared

2141
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,280
for the fact that duty changes behavior

2142
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,480
just because we are using

2143
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:42,800
longer trial durations right

2144
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,360
right okay

2145
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:51,120
and yeah there are some

2146
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,679
future improvements basically i

2147
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:54,239
envisioned

2148
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:57,760
that after some months i will

2149
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,440
do another go at the algorithm to

2150
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:05,199
do some more improvements

2151
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:08,239
one of them is basically

2152
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:10,719
introduce back the improvement that i

2153
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:12,480
had in the code previously but

2154
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,840
now i have removed it to make the code

2155
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,639
more simple of course i will need to

2156
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:19,920
test it whether it is still

2157
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,040
desirable but i i have a feeling that it

2158
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,440
will be

2159
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:27,360
desirable that is basically

2160
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,280
earlier phases can use larger

2161
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,400
interval width so the next phase always

2162
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,040
start

2163
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,080
bisecting the previous interval

2164
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,440
because this will never hurt and it will

2165
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:43,840
save one by section in the previous

2166
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,040
phase so it

2167
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:48,400
always saves

2168
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,400
time so i think it will be back

2169
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,080
and there are more

2170
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:01,199
possible improvements one is

2171
01:29:01,199 --> 01:29:05,360
to make configurable external search

2172
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:08,480
in my example when there was a

2173
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,880
failure and the previous liquid bound is

2174
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,400
no longer valid

2175
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,960
the algorithm was doubling the interval

2176
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:15,600
search

2177
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,280
but in practice uh this is a not the

2178
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,560
optimal way to do

2179
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,360
we for example decided that quadrupling

2180
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,800
the interval with

2181
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,679
gives better results because usually

2182
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:30,159
when

2183
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,880
you find out that the old bound no

2184
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,440
longer

2185
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,719
holds the new bounds are not

2186
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:40,719
adjacent there are several

2187
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,000
expansions away so

2188
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,679
by increasing the interval length

2189
01:29:47,679 --> 01:29:50,960
more aggressively we can spend we can

2190
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,440
save some time on average

2191
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:56,560
so this will probably also get back

2192
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,719
and finally there is uneven splits

2193
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,440
this is some information theory applied

2194
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:04,320
to this

2195
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,679
if the current interval width is not

2196
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,280
a power of two we can

2197
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,400
spend some time by not

2198
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,880
splitting evenly but trying to get

2199
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:17,920
closer in

2200
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,239
to the power of two of the resulting

2201
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,920
intervals for example

2202
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,400
one to two split is the logical thing to

2203
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,120
do if you

2204
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,159
find yourself to be in three times

2205
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:31,679
your interval goal so

2206
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:35,120
this will be another improvement

2207
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,320
on average so i think it will be worth

2208
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:44,320
documenting in this in this next version

2209
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,080
so i agree so

2210
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:51,199
i just need to first

2211
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:54,400
finish documenting the changes i have

2212
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:54,960
made

2213
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,520
for this meeting and then after some

2214
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,040
time implement the

2215
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:00,880
rest of the improvements and document

2216
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,320
them so expect

2217
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,480
at least two more draft versions

2218
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,360
well well that's that's great i i think

2219
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,880
you're headed down the right path

2220
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,520
for uh several of these uh veraco and

2221
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,159
maciac

2222
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:17,679
and uh you know just in my my opinion as

2223
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:19,520
a as a participant this is getting

2224
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,400
better

2225
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,440
i i you know i i even encountered a case

2226
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,440
like the one you described with the

2227
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:26,880
you know the binary search with loss

2228
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,800
verification algorithm you're a little

2229
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,159
bit aggressive on

2230
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:33,760
moving the limits around and um uh

2231
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,080
how to fix one of those and and you know

2232
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,360
it only it only really

2233
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,520
it only really showed up because of uh

2234
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,120
you know one kind of corner case of

2235
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:41,920
testing so

2236
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,120
uh but but it's good to get these things

2237
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,960
uh

2238
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,679
fixed before we uh send them out in the

2239
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:50,080
world

2240
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,880
so that's good uh any any comments on

2241
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:53,440
the uh

2242
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,840
on the draft or and or the future plans

2243
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,840
here

2244
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,120
all right um can we get some volunteers

2245
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:07,760
to uh

2246
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,040
to review this as uh when when

2247
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,920
vrodko and masiak make a new draft

2248
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,400
available

2249
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:29,840
okay well um we'll continue to push for

2250
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,639
uh for reviewers on the mailing list and

2251
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,639
um

2252
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,400
and and thank you for your time and your

2253
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,320
your preparation today uh

2254
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,080
racco and massey much appreciated

2255
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,440
yeah thank you and and congratulations

2256
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,080
on your

2257
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,600
this is your first version of the

2258
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,280
working group draft so

2259
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,120
uh you know now now is when the working

2260
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:52,400
group really has to start paying

2261
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,199
attention

2262
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,880
uh that's that's with my working group

2263
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,440
chairs hat on

2264
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:01,599
yeah congratulations uh good call adal

2265
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,280
all right so um

2266
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,199
oh marcia yes just uh evratco in case

2267
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:10,800
you haven't seen the carson asked the

2268
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:12,159
question on the

2269
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:15,440
on the chat whether there is any a plan

2270
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,360
or an observation of mlr search used in

2271
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,520
other contexts then fdio which is where

2272
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,040
the code

2273
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:22,639
is being developed and are there any

2274
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:24,960
other implementations on the horizon

2275
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,679
um radco do you want to take that or do

2276
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:30,400
you want me to talk

2277
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:34,400
well uh there is one version of a mlr

2278
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:34,880
search

2279
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,320
library in python available on pi pi but

2280
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,600
it is an older version that's what we

2281
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,800
are currently

2282
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,000
using in ccit basically

2283
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,199
in fdio we do not have a good process

2284
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:52,560
to publish different versions as quickly

2285
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:52,960
as

2286
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:55,280
we are able to produce them so we

2287
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:58,159
definitely want to improve on that

2288
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:00,719
and other than that i am not aware of

2289
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,840
anybody else trying to

2290
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,159
this algorithm i think everybody

2291
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:11,440
that i know of is using this

2292
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:14,719
python library yeah

2293
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:18,560
and in terms uh of

2294
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,040
in terms of who is using those i know

2295
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:21,600
that the

2296
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,960
nfv bench guys um uh were

2297
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:27,040
using it at some point i don't know what

2298
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,400
is the current situation

2299
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,960
um i mean interacting with alec

2300
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,000
hawthorne so

2301
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,400
i'll you may you may know better the

2302
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,760
situation there

2303
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,040
and um but in the context of fdio we do

2304
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:39,520
have

2305
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,199
uh podesta fdio uh carson

2306
01:34:43,199 --> 01:34:45,760
answering questions and we have members

2307
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,239
of

2308
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:49,119
linux foundation networking where fdio

2309
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:50,000
sits

2310
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,560
um together with openv and so on and we

2311
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:53,440
have

2312
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,800
the um we have

2313
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,239
the intel and arm

2314
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:03,360
as at least two

2315
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:07,119
parties that are using the mlr search

2316
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:11,280
but that is done in with system code

2317
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,920
and we're currently testing vbp and dpdk

2318
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,600
in fdio

2319
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,639
uh the other guys are testing uh

2320
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:22,080
you know whatever they they

2321
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,960
they develop or or verify i i don't have

2322
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,440
a full visibility

2323
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,520
the main domain in case it is not clear

2324
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,679
for for folks and i don't know to a

2325
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,560
degree we describe it in a in the draft

2326
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,080
intro the main goal here is to really

2327
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:42,159
uh reduce the amount of time it takes to

2328
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:43,360
discover the rates

2329
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:47,040
um and and the target uh environment or

2330
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:50,159
or deployment uh scenario is

2331
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,080
automated test execution for for

2332
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:54,080
benchmarking uh run by

2333
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:56,960
as part of the ci cicd system to verify

2334
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,400
the performance of you know physical

2335
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,199
appliances or or virtual appliances

2336
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,840
um and apply this algorithm not only to

2337
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,440
packets per seconds or beat per second

2338
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:06,560
throughput but

2339
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,000
we also have applied it now to

2340
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,880
connections per seconds and

2341
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,320
and and unstateful uh

2342
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,600
throughput let's put it this way so we

2343
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,480
believe it is

2344
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:22,639
quite universally applicable as a

2345
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:24,239
as alternative to a straightforward

2346
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,239
binary search and with addition of the

2347
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:27,760
multi-rate support

2348
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,960
one can now define um uh not only

2349
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,280
zero frame loss and some non-zero plr a

2350
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:34,800
packet loss ratio

2351
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:39,840
but uh but but more rates if one desires

2352
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:44,480
so hopefully this answers thanks

2353
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,520
good thank you um

2354
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,199
when it comes to nfv bench i think

2355
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:50,639
that's uh in its

2356
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,639
sunset mode of operation that's that's

2357
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:53,679
my quick feedback

2358
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:58,000
there from uh uh the parent project

2359
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,080
uh what we now call what we now call

2360
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,119
aniket

2361
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:04,159
uh open platform for nfv has become

2362
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:08,800
uh a an egyptian goddess of the nile

2363
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,239
and okay so um yeah yeah it is kind of

2364
01:37:12,239 --> 01:37:12,880
nice

2365
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,400
so um we will uh we'll

2366
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,080
we'll look forward to the um to the

2367
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,719
changes and the updated uh drafts of

2368
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,760
maciac and veraco and thanks very much

2369
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,320
for your

2370
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,560
uh discussion today thank you

2371
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,600
all right so on to the next and that is

2372
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,600
um vladimir

2373
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,440
and uh he wants to tell us a little bit

2374
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,440
about his work at the hackathon and

2375
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:41,280
and um you know maybe some other topics

2376
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,760
too uh

2377
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,080
looking for yep he's still here vladimir

2378
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,119
still here

2379
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:50,560
so uh

2380
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:53,360
can can you be heard vladimir you can't

2381
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,679
hear me

2382
01:37:57,700 --> 01:37:59,199
[Music]

2383
01:37:59,199 --> 01:38:03,839
speak speak a little louder

2384
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:17,839
very faintly or very low level

2385
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,119
can you hear me now much better thank

2386
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,159
you

2387
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:26,639
okay i uh he only has a chance to

2388
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,520
test the microphone with meat ankles so

2389
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,760
i change the microphone now

2390
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,119
yeah it's a short

2391
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:38,559
sequence of slides so

2392
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,480
you can go to the next one this

2393
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,080
this uh briefly describes the

2394
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:46,320
uh

2395
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,119
[Music]

2396
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:52,719
the goal for the project obviously

2397
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:58,000
it has the the drafts and then

2398
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,840
are four repositories with uh

2399
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,280
white the the test code for the the test

2400
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,159
case

2401
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:09,520
implemented in python uh there is a

2402
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,880
net conf a young specific code which

2403
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:15,920
implements everything related to young

2404
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:18,400
and net conf

2405
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,760
passes the configuration and

2406
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,960
it calls the command line tool

2407
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,480
and this command line 2 can be

2408
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,560
implemented for any type of

2409
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,679
tester that already exists

2410
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,480
and there we have like a reference

2411
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,360
implementation

2412
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,840
in hardware which is done in very walk

2413
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:38,400
and

2414
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:42,159
even unicorn box and

2415
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:45,760
pcb which connects like uh off-the-shelf

2416
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:46,880
fpga board

2417
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,119
so that we can synthesize that so we can

2418
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,639
actually

2419
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:54,560
measure how good other test generators

2420
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,840
are implementing this draft

2421
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:01,280
if they implement it

2422
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,360
so this this is the first slide and if

2423
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,360
you go to the next one

2424
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:09,040
okay do you hear me well or should i

2425
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:09,440
speak

2426
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:12,080
you wilder i can i can hear you just

2427
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:12,480
fine

2428
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,719
uh vladimir you're you're much better

2429
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:16,000
once you change microphones

2430
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,119
or something okay good

2431
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:22,400
so this should be fairly simple even for

2432
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,360
people without

2433
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,639
interest in testing we have even like

2434
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:30,320
tags for the interfaces and the device

2435
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,920
so we have a tester and we have the same

2436
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,560
device

2437
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,880
implementing the device under test just

2438
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,040
different sd cards

2439
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:42,239
and this this was the setup for

2440
01:40:42,239 --> 01:40:45,360
the hackathon so

2441
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,320
if you go to the next slide

2442
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,719
this is the last slide and this is a

2443
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,159
detailed

2444
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,960
description of the implementation so we

2445
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,080
we have a software implementation which

2446
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,440
you can run on any linux

2447
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:06,880
hardware which is going through the

2448
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,840
the socket api and the kernel and the

2449
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,800
dma

2450
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,320
comes down to the mac so it is

2451
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,440
not as deterministic as the other one

2452
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,280
which is the hardware

2453
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,199
very walk implementation which is just

2454
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:22,639
configured to

2455
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:27,040
register interface and

2456
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,920
both devices have the same command line

2457
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,040
to interface so

2458
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:34,159
actually it's very simple to select

2459
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:35,520
if you want to use the software

2460
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:36,719
implementation or the hardware

2461
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,480
implementation

2462
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:42,719
and the netcons codes like the young

2463
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:45,199
core implementation just calls command

2464
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:46,639
line tools

2465
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:48,880
so if you have if you are a manufacturer

2466
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,320
of test equipment

2467
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,560
you just need to make a command line too

2468
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,320
you don't need to know anything about

2469
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,520
netcon for young and

2470
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,760
it's implemented in a transactional way

2471
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,520
like you have uh

2472
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,080
command line two that starts the traffic

2473
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,840
generator

2474
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,639
for a certain interface and then if you

2475
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:09,520
make a change

2476
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:13,520
then it stops it and starts it again

2477
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,560
when you do a commit in net confirms

2478
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,679
so i'm trying to separate the net

2479
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,239
complexity from what people actually

2480
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:22,880
doing

2481
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,880
traffic generators and otherwise just

2482
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,719
need to know

2483
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:29,119
this is important if this draft is going

2484
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:32,159
to be a success i think

2485
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:35,600
so this underscored

2486
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,719
text this has links to the repositories

2487
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,920
and everything is open source so if

2488
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,760
there is anyone interested in how we do

2489
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:44,400
it

2490
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,879
it's more than welcome to check it out

2491
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:54,239
very good yeah and

2492
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:57,360
i think important point with this

2493
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:01,199
next step with the draft is to to find

2494
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:02,639
actually

2495
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:05,119
uh serious organizations which are

2496
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:06,239
interested in it

2497
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:10,000
i'm not seeing much of a point

2498
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,920
of pushing the draft before such a party

2499
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,480
exists

2500
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,960
i can continue working on it you are

2501
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:17,840
more than

2502
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,600
helpful bringing focus to the world so

2503
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,040
anyone knows that it exists

2504
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,040
so we can just continue doing that on

2505
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:29,840
the next hack

2506
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:38,960
well we've um i'm sorry go ahead um

2507
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,560
i'm pretty much finished

2508
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,320
with the presentation that the last

2509
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,760
slide just shows the

2510
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,520
the amount of work done during the

2511
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:49,440
hackathon

2512
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,800
if you go down it was one yes it's a

2513
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,119
very minimal amount of work compared to

2514
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:55,600
the

2515
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:59,600
the entire project so this is just

2516
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:03,280
implementing the latest changes

2517
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:07,360
and it is yeah we granted also public

2518
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,960
access to the netconf note

2519
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,320
so there are some existing validation

2520
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,760
tools that can say

2521
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:16,320
if the implementation is okay or not

2522
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:19,440
this really doesn't have much

2523
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,920
significance for the the standardization

2524
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:24,239
work

2525
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,400
with the model like this small like we

2526
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,159
test our implementation of it

2527
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:30,639
but other people can have their

2528
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:31,520
obviously own

2529
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,440
implementations and this is not that

2530
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,199
significant for the workload this was

2531
01:44:35,199 --> 01:44:36,400
more significant for the

2532
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,360
the hackathon presentation so this

2533
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,360
presentation we didn't have a chance to

2534
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,320
present

2535
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,639
during the hackathon so it's not a

2536
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:46,239
duplicated

2537
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:50,000
effort anyone interested can check the

2538
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,199
the presentation down here

2539
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:56,560
very good all right

2540
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,840
well um i noticed

2541
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:05,119
uh i'm just gonna you know jump in with

2542
01:45:05,119 --> 01:45:07,440
my participants uh comments uh

2543
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:10,639
vladimir i i wanted to check on on

2544
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:11,760
something that i thought i

2545
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,520
saw in the uh

2546
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,560
in the benchmarking page for this so let

2547
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,199
me

2548
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,719
let me look a little bit here

2549
01:45:23,330 --> 01:45:26,409
[Music]

2550
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:31,040
um

2551
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,960
i'm basically trying to bring up the uh

2552
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,480
the data tracker for this

2553
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,760
where is it related draft so it would be

2554
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,760
down at the bottom right

2555
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,199
oh yeah so um

2556
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:47,840
there's uh there's some yang validation

2557
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,159
returned warnings or errors

2558
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:54,159
on um on the data tracker page that uh

2559
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,679
that includes this

2560
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:59,199
this draft so that's um

2561
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:00,719
that's something to take a look at it

2562
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:04,400
looks like it's only one warning though

2563
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,840
let's see

2564
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:27,520
um

2565
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,199
uh oh i am i'm certain this is a bug

2566
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:34,480
in the young lint tool that is one of

2567
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,080
the validation tools

2568
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,320
but we can take it on the mailing list i

2569
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,239
will double check and i will

2570
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:44,000
reply but i i double checked it

2571
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,159
when i submit the draft so i will triple

2572
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,600
check it

2573
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,800
yeah that's good thank you um

2574
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,280
i mean it looks it looks to me here as

2575
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,400
though there's

2576
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:57,600
um really something trivial

2577
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,840
it wasn't even worth um pursuing

2578
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,679
with everybody else's time but i saw

2579
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:08,480
this i did see this red uh

2580
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,639
yang indication before and i wanted to

2581
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,159
check that uh

2582
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,520
if there was something we needed to do

2583
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,760
and something you knew about we could

2584
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:18,320
um make that as a comment here today i

2585
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:19,040
think it

2586
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,719
just just to bring it to your attention

2587
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:22,800
it's probably something that will turn

2588
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,480
uh something quick you can do that can

2589
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,280
turn that that indication green

2590
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,800
very quickly okay so then let's

2591
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,480
go back to the slides and does uh does

2592
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,800
anybody have any comments on on the work

2593
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:39,840
i mean just just as a background we we

2594
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:42,239
uh we did see some pretty good comments

2595
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,080
from tom petch

2596
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,960
and um uh i think some other reviewers

2597
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,840
plan to take a look at this

2598
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,080
um and and and frankly this is one of

2599
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:52,960
the more

2600
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,040
this is one of the more active uh

2601
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,679
proposals in the working group now

2602
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,320
so um you know we might consider we

2603
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:00,800
might

2604
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,480
consider adopting this work and uh

2605
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,600
pushing the draft through

2606
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,840
you know our normal process if if that's

2607
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,880
what folks want to do

2608
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:18,800
oh i i'm open for getting some

2609
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:22,080
co-opters and someone who can

2610
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,360
help me with the work and i'm open to

2611
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:28,560
to accepting anyone who who the group

2612
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:29,119
can

2613
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:32,320
nominate to join me in this i i think

2614
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,719
there is very

2615
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:37,440
good opportunity to cooperate with the

2616
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,320
ml search

2617
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:41,600
draft because as i see it the the ml

2618
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,360
search is

2619
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:46,960
okay command line too in my view

2620
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,760
that performs the search while i am

2621
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:50,719
implementing

2622
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:54,320
a draft specifying the parameters for

2623
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,080
another command line two

2624
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:59,040
which is the the trial so that the

2625
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,280
search algorithm is calling

2626
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:04,480
iteratively the trail and that's what we

2627
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:04,960
have

2628
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,360
standardized in the draft so these are

2629
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,320
two drops which

2630
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,960
are they they should be able to work

2631
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,639
together

2632
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:15,360
so i can make a review of the the search

2633
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,360
algorithm draft and propose

2634
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,639
interface i i looked into the python

2635
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:21,199
codes

2636
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:25,040
and in the

2637
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:28,159
fdio repository they have and i think

2638
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:30,480
it's easy to make it a command line too

2639
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,719
and it it's much easier for a reviewer

2640
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:34,239
to look in a command line too

2641
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:38,000
than a gigantic evaluate

2642
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,520
framework in written in

2643
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:45,679
objective python so

2644
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:47,599
we can collaborate with that then and

2645
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:49,119
then we can get

2646
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:51,679
some idea of how things can work out

2647
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:54,880
with both drafts i think

2648
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:59,199
okay any uh any response to that

2649
01:50:02,080 --> 01:50:04,800
i will respond uh i i was raising head

2650
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,199
but

2651
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:07,760
you are not looking uh oh sorry you can

2652
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,280
tell what i'm looking at and it wasn't

2653
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,320
that i'm i apologize baracka

2654
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,320
i was just hoping he will switch back to

2655
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,239
see nevermind

2656
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:19,520
from my point of view mr

2657
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:22,840
search uses a

2658
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:25,920
plug-able piece of code it is called

2659
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:26,639
measurer

2660
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:29,440
which is doing measurements basically it

2661
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,960
gets

2662
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:33,520
all the traffic definition and duration

2663
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:35,280
and rate and

2664
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:39,119
expects a result and i can

2665
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:42,400
envision this

2666
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:44,880
i'm not sure about the end but

2667
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,480
definitely the

2668
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,920
cli tool be part of that measurer

2669
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,440
there will be some layer connecting it

2670
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,280
together but

2671
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:58,480
yeah definitely the mlr search has some

2672
01:50:58,480 --> 01:50:59,440
requirements

2673
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:02,239
which are subsets of what this draft

2674
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,400
seems to be describing so

2675
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,599
it should work and

2676
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:11,679
yes in fdio we are trying to improve our

2677
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:14,000
our code to make it more modular

2678
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,760
basically we already have some command

2679
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,119
line utility with

2680
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:21,840
ad hoc arguments uh so it will be

2681
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:25,040
we are planning to to make it more

2682
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,520
let's say systematic so i will

2683
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,159
definitely

2684
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:31,520
look uh more deeply into this draft and

2685
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:34,960
uh either change the fdi code to

2686
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,320
follow it more closely or ask questions

2687
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,280
comments on the mailing list when i see

2688
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:41,920
something that

2689
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,280
does not really fit i'm not sure if i

2690
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:45,760
will be

2691
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:48,000
doing as much work as to be called

2692
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,280
co-author but

2693
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:51,360
you can definitely count on me to do

2694
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:54,559
