10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,439
we have

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,840

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,839

okay i'm not able to scroll for some

14
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
reason

15
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,079
let me stop sharing and i'll come back

16
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,839
in a sec

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
all right let's hope this works this

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
time

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,599
all right so here's the note well for

20
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,720
the meeting

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,400
that you guys are familiar with

22
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
as far as the meat echo is concerned i

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,040
hope

24
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
you guys are here so you must have seen

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,599
the link

26
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,920
you should be able to see the chat

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
window

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,879
that you can actually detach and keep it

29
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,760
as a separate tab

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,400
and the hum windows i think next to the

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,840
chat

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,599
um or if you remove it's now right next

33
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,640
to the

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
list of um attendees

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
and that's where if any polls are

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,640
conducted you will see any messages

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,239
the virtual blue sheet

38
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,319
you don't have to do anything the meat

39
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,120
echo will record your presence

40
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,040
uh and the queue and of course screen

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
management echo

42
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,200
that's just a quick thing i did post a

43
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
link to the

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,200
suggesting people uh signed into a

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
virtual blue sheet at the bottom of the

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,599
code md page

47
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,440
so maybe that was miscommunication but

48
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,920
okay not a bad idea still

49
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,839
if you want to put your name down

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,519
to cue make sure that you use the

51
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,239
microphone

52
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,760
icon with the hand symbol to indicate

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
that you want um that you want to speak

54
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,400
and then of course when it's your turn

55
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,080
to speak

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,120
you can use the microphone icon with the

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,560
play symbol

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,360
actually there is no play symbol it's

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,239
just a microphone icon now

60
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,040
so there's a hand raised to get into the

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,519
queue

62
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,360
and of course the microphone to speak

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,000
um jabber um we'll see in the next slide

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,358
there is also a note

65
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,880
taking pad so would love to

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,320
have everyone contribute to that page um

67
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
we use that to compile our minutes at

68
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,680
the end of the meeting

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
and my screen is stuck again

70
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:57,520
let me give you one second

71
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
okay

72
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
for jabber setup here are the

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,600
instructions um

74
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
you can find the answers to all your

75
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,440
questions

76
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,479
um whatever you post on jabber

77
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
will of course get cross posted to the

78
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
meet echo chat window

79
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,120
which is what we will be monitoring

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
and of course the logs will be available

81
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
after the meeting

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
at the link provided

83
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,520
so here's the status of the workgroup

84
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
items

85
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
the yank push notification capabilities

86
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,520
past the second working of last call

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
and kentuck has provided the shepherd's

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,720
review

89
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
of the document and i believe recently

90
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,520
the authors have

91
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,799
provided an update

92
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,160
trust anchors and key stores a set of

93
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,960
drafts

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,400
that are i believe still in working

95
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,039
group last call

96
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,800
um they went through

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,319
the two of them went through sector

98
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,280
review and

99
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,960
i believe currently we are waiting on

100
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,080
young doctors

101
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,479
response

102
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
for crypto types which is the third

103
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
draft in that suite of transaction for

104
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
working group last call

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
is waiting on a sector review at this

106
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,360
time

107
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
and just like trust anchor and keystore

108
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,720
we're still

109
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
waiting on young doctor's response

110
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,000
to um

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,479
to the comments we have that the author

112
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
has provided

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,400
the client server suite address which is

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,840
the remaining set of drafts

115
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
will start working group last call after

116
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,039
idf110

117
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,800
the https notification is

118
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,000
in working of glass calls still

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
[Music]

120
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,479
and then yang push notification messages

121
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,080
yes it has expired and the last time we

122
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,800
said

123
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
we would probably um wait for https

124
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,440
native

125
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,319
to go through before resurrecting this

126
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,240
rap

127
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
at this point i believe that two can be

128
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,680
um

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
are not linked anymore and the push

130
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
notification messages

131
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,440
can the authors can go ahead and provide

132
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,919
an update

133
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,160
the udp native tract is work in progress

134
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,039
and so is the distributed node of draft

135
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,960
and finally the sctp csr draft

136
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,400
is in working with glasgow

137
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,840
any comments or questions

138
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,280
so i do notice that binbot has said that

139
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,360
the yank push notification capabilities

140
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,080
he will address the last the comments

141
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,560
that

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,199
can provide it which is good

143
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,199
all right if there are no other comments

144
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,199
um here's what we

145
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,200
um actually the agenda is slightly

146
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,320
modified from what

147
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,719
it's here we are

148
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,479
going to get an update on the

149
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,800
udp or unite set of traps

150
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,480
before this and

151
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,440
then kent will come on to present his

152
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,959
client server suite of drafts

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
and the csr

154
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,320
as a tp bootstrapping draft i'll be

155
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
followed by me

156
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,360
on the http based transport for

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
configured subscription

158
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,080
and as i said tom thank to us

159
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,279
and then our peers are going to present

160
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,480
the united states address up front

161
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,920
on the non-chartered suite set of

162
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,519
droughts we have

163
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,160
penguin talking about telemetric data

164
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,240
export capabilities

165
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,440
and followed by chin

166
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,200
okay i think i have the agenda

167
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
wrong here so let me just read off uh

168
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,880
what's actually

169
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,320
in them so we have

170
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
telemetry data export capability

171
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,360
followed by adaptive subscription

172
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,720
which will be followed by with system

173
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,279
capabilities

174
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
and then finally i'll come back to talk

175
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,560
a little bit about

176
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,959
netcount next and rest count next

177
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,839
and that's as far as the agenda is

178
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,240
concerned

179
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,399
all right um that let me stop

180
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,240
sharing and

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,720
i believe tomas is supposed to present

182
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,200
my hash between your two shares um it

183
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,160
could i just say

184
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,360
a thing we did receive a sorry this is

185
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
kent

186
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,200
um we did receive a liaison request

187
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
from the oif technical committee

188
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
they are um

189
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,320
they uh noticed this is the 220

190
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,680
transport sdn

191
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,000
api interoperability demonstration white

192
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
paper

193
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
and they're having a virtual meeting

194
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,959
scheduled in two days

195
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
no i'm sorry not two days may the 10th

196
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
not march the 10th and actually i see

197
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
i would share this screen but there's a

198
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
number of oaf

199
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,399
individuals on the participant list as

200
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,240
well as some names that we

201
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
are familiar with anise uh sheikh

202
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,640
and rob shakir from open config i don't

203
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
know if they're on the call if they want

204
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,839
to say anything about it

205
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
let me see if they're on the call

206
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,200
i don't see either on the call so anyway

207
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
i just want to let the group know about

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
the

209
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
layers on request

210
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,959
all right to pass i know

211
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
okay

212
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,000
okay i love everybody can you

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
see my screen

214
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,320
yet but i can see your video and

215
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,959
hear your voice okay perfect then

216
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,399
i will start uh i would like to give a

217
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,279
brief presentation what we did last week

218
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
in the the virtual hackathon

219
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,079
with the bmp young push in this

220
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,240
presentation i will just focus on

221
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,320
the young push part in case you want to

222
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,600
see also

223
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
what we did on the bmp on the bgp

224
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,920
monitoring protocol part

225
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,360
then please follow up the link

226
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
the presentation so

227
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,839
regarding yang push our focus was mainly

228
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
on the two drafts udp no different

229
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
distributed motif

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
we have been working for quite a while

231
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,279
in the

232
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,680
in an open source project where we are

233
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
working on

234
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,600
the collection library and also on a

235
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
mockup publisher

236
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
and with this hack within this hackathon

237
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,279
we were finalizing the work there

238
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,040
and integrating into the pmacct

239
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,120
open source uh object data collection

240
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,360
yes this was in regards to what i was

241
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,959
going to be proceeding

242
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,399
just to let you know

243
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
performance i must just quickly i think

244
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,760
my hash is still trying to bring up your

245
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,560
slides

246
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,200
so just give them a second for that yeah

247
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,920
give me once

248
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,440
can you see the slides now

249
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,680
uh you know maybe maybe i should let him

250
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,360
present it till i figure out what's

251
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,800
happening at my end

252
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,839
sure okay

253
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,120
ah i see

254
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,920
okay

255
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,360
so then let me go back

256
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
can you see the screen now yes

257
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,760
good thank you okay sorry about that

258
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,000
uh so as i said on the functionality

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
part we were working on to the

260
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,959
integration into a pmact

261
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,959
for the collection library and also for

262
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,120
the mockup publisher

263
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,959
and for the performance part we were

264
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,160
looking into

265
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,360
testing the efficiency after all

266
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,800
for us important is uh scaling that we

267
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,600
can get

268
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,000
as much as fast as possible the matrix

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
from the from the network

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,440
and also see how it performs in terms of

271
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
values packet sizes

272
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
so that's the software we used within

273
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,519
this network environment and

274
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,680
the collector uh and also the

275
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,199
the democrat um software both are

276
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,079
implemented in

277
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,839
c uh segmentation is supported

278
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,839
and it has been integrated into a pmacct

279
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,959
this is basically uh in this hackathon

280
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,360
the first time we were able to produce

281
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,839
a matrix into apache kafka

282
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,440
and uh in regards to the performance

283
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,120
test sector which we did is

284
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
uh we were basically uh set one

285
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,639
dedicated core on this linux machine for

286
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,320
the for the collector we did

287
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,600
in 10 test runs with 500 000

288
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,399
messages east each and we were body

289
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,800
varying basically the the message sizes

290
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,560
between 200 bytes

291
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,120
1500 and jumbo frames

292
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,199
and depending on the the packet size

293
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,759
we we achieved different throughput

294
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,000
throughput which is a much higher with

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,720
the

296
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,279
current young push provides the young

297
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,360
push implementations

298
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
so we are quite pleased with the results

299
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,360
which we achieved

300
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,040
well that's for the

301
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,680
hackathon so far any questions

302
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,199
i see uh chiffon lou has his hand up

303
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
sure

304
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,959
um chiffon are you able to request a

305
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,518
microphone

306
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,399
okay i don't see that anymore uh in the

307
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,279
chat window

308
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,759
um slm is request is asking about the

309
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,800
blue sheet

310
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,040
uh apparently meet echo will

311
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,880
automatically log your

312
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
attendance in the call so you don't need

313
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,400
to actually sign the blue sheet

314
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,240
and i'm going to remove shifang from the

315
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
queue thomas please

316
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,079
proceed or i guess you're done any other

317
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,799
questions for

318
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,720
thomas oh that's

319
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,000
a swap from my side otherwise if you

320
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,400
have

321
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,839
questions in regards of the the

322
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,079
implementations

323
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,720
please feel free to contact me

324
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,960
thomas i have one question for you you

325
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,160
said that performance

326
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,880
was much better was that in terms of a

327
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
latency or throughput or both

328
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
and also can you give any relative

329
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,919
numbers uh

330
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,160
as to what the proprietary

331
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,240
implementations are achieving

332
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,559
i can say that uh we haven't been

333
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,520
testing on

334
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
on latency so we were focusing this time

335
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,080
only on throughput

336
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,600
and uh it's hard to to compare it to

337
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,480
existing

338
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,600
uh implementation with grpc

339
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
but what we've seen is uh we are by

340
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,640
factors

341
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
well beyond 10 20 times higher

342
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,360
and then grpc but

343
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,080
one of our next goals basically

344
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,960
throughout the year

345
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,919
is now to add a basic also https notif

346
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,600
and then uh compare https notified udp

347
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,039
notif

348
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,120
to see what are the performance

349
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,918
difference in them

350
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
i would hazard a guess that it's

351
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,400
actually uh worse than grpc

352
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,160
even okay you know because it's neither

353
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,200
uh binary nor it's also requiring an

354
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,000
acknowledgement per notification so i

355
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
mean even though it can be pipelined

356
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,799
but uh just my expectation right

357
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,440
uh and also maybe you need to state that

358
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,720
the encoding is a

359
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,160
chase and so uh it will obviously change

360
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
when you're switching from json to uh

361
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,559
simple encoding

362
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,840
yes and uh also the actually the hp node

363
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
of draft uh

364
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,799
it's the encoding is media type um

365
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,200
defined so currently the draft defines

366
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
json and xml but it

367
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
is possible i think what you're just

368
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,960
alluding to for a c board to be encoded

369
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
as well

370
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,520
okay okay

371
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
all right well thank you thomas i know

372
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,799
you need to move to another meeting so

373
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,760
thank you

374
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,480
yeah thanks a lot

375
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,080
and my hush i think i'm up next so

376
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,520
are you going to be able to present my

377
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
slides yeah let me

378
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,280
try using the browser this time

379
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,010
and

380
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,200
[Music]

381
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,880
okay looks good

382
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,320
okay thank you um so continuing

383
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,960
with these uh client server suite of

384
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
drafts

385
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,760
a quick update uh since 109

386
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,960
the three lowest level drafts have been

387
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,159
updated twice

388
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,159
sorry once the updates were primarily

389
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,039
around

390
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,840
the various sector reviews that had come

391
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,799
in

392
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,320
and in particular

393
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,039
we updated the security considerations

394
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,480
section to

395
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,919
uh detail or specify more information

396
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,240
about the unconstrained public key usage

397
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,039
in unconstrained private key usage

398
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,240
essentially what we

399
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
mean by unconstrained here is uh

400
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,919
typically certificates

401
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,919
x59 certificates have a notion of key

402
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,679
usage so you can say if it's signing

403
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,240
only

404
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
or encryption only or so currently the

405
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
keys that are in the key store are

406
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,200
unconstrained there's no

407
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,240
attribute connect associated with them

408
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,799
at least when in a raw form when the

409
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,600
keys are

410
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,799
in an alternate form then such

411
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,679
attributes can be associated with them

412
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:02,159
and

413
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,240
the other form being the the one

414
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,360
asymmetric key

415
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,440
and the one symmetric key those other

416
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,640
asn.1

417
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,760
formats that are possible

418
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,240
also we updated the encryption strategy

419
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
the one that was there so this is how a

420
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,159
key can encrypt another key

421
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,760
and the strategy that was previously

422
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,919
specified was not

423
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,039
to implementable it nicely uh jurgen

424
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,320
pointed it out in his uh

425
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,480
yang doctor review which was sort of

426
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,360
beyond the

427
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,120
the scope of what a young doctor would

428
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,559
be expected to do but nonetheless

429
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,280
appreciated

430
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,559
that he discovered um a gap and

431
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
then i conferred with uh russ housley

432
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
who is a security expert

433
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,520
and uh over the course of a couple weeks

434
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,400
uh

435
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,039
managed to uh come up the solution that

436
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,240
actually i shouldn't say is difficult

437
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,720
but

438
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
it was really just an issue of logistics

439
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,320
and us coordinating the time to

440
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,760
talk about it but the current solution

441
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
is definitely implementable

442
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
um also we added a password grouping

443
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,120
example

444
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
to the cryptotypes usage example it

445
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,880
wasn't there before so now that

446
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
example in the draft of the crypto text

447
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
draft is complete

448
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,440
so each of the possible groupings that

449
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,559
are defined in the graph

450
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,240
of the draft are now having a

451
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,360
representation in that example

452
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,679
and we added an encrypting password

453
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,600
section to the security uh consideration

454
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,320
section so that

455
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,799
whole section was missing before and of

456
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,240
course the young doctor other young

457
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
doctor reviews

458
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,480
comments were addressed for both trust

459
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,000
tankers and key stored the

460
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,440
same kind of update into their

461
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
security considerations with regards to

462
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,720
the unconstrained

463
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,919
public slash private key usage and

464
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,960
also other comments that were affected

465
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
by the yang doctor review

466
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,039
next slide please

467
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,679
okay and then effective really for the

468
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,159
remainder of the drafts that all of them

469
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,880
there is a sort of collateral damage or

470
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,440
you know

471
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
that they all had comments they were all

472
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
modified in ways that were

473
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,159
uh addressing comments raised by the

474
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,919
young doctor reviews

475
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,840
um in the uh crypto type trust store and

476
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,360
keystore drafts but special to just the

477
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,799
http client server draft there was also

478
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,000
there was a there was a note that was

479
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,039
dangling in one of in the yang module

480
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,760
and that got removed because we

481
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,039
discussed it as a

482
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,159
working group in the 108 session

483
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,159
and resolved that issue so that note got

484
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,760
removed

485
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,640
next slide please

486
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,960
and the last slide okay so um

487
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,000
we i should say the chairs uh

488
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,440
requested early sector reviews for these

489
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
three lower level drafts

490
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,559
crypto tribes trust anchors and keystore

491
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,880
so far we've only actually received the

492
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
sector reviews for the

493
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,440
latter two we never actually received a

494
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
sector review for crypto types

495
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,200
itself so we're kind of wondering if

496
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,320
this is an issue

497
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,360
um you know um and

498
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,320
so potentially it's not an issue and the

499
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,279
reason why is because in order to review

500
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,840
the trust or the keystore drafts it and

501
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,279
requires or entails

502
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,919
understanding the cryptotypes drafts so

503
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:36,400
those

504
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,600
uh the cryptochip's draft was sort of um

505
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,279
implicitly reviewed uh in in part

506
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,159
and also because uh the cryptotypes

507
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:46,799
draft

508
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,440
as i just mentioned russ housley worked

509
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,039
with me uh closely

510
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,320
um he used to be a.d of the security

511
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,120
area

512
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,159
um and um you know so

513
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,880
he was deep in the weeds with me on the

514
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
cryptid types draft

515
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,360
so i think that it's pretty solid from

516
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,799
his perspective

517
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,520
and then lastly uh recall that the only

518
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,320
reason we do

519
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,880
early sector reviews is to hope you know

520
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,840
to sort of hedge our bets so that'll um

521
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,080
more uh likely get through the isg

522
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,240
last call review when when uh when the

523
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,400
you know it's published to the isg

524
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,880
and of course they will at that time do

525
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,279
a sector or not it's not even sector

526
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
at that time they will do a security

527
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,320
review

528
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,640
so i think the fact that the crypto type

529
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,080
strap did not actually

530
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,880
uh obtain an early sector review is not

531
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,480
a blocker of any sort

532
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,240
and we we should proceed um with

533
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,880
that any comments on that before moving

534
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,159
to the next

535
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,480
item

536
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,760
okay well then oh sorry go ahead and

537
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,240
don't need to

538
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,080
rob i see that yeah okay here you okay

539
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,400
good go ahead um so just got a question

540
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
on this i think what you're proposing

541
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,960
makes sense to me

542
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,279
um the only question is if any issues

543
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,520
came up with crypto types

544
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,120
during isg review or a sector review

545
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,240
before that would that

546
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,840
have any impact on the other drafts

547
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,200
absolutely possible but mind you that

548
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,960
at least from a working group strategy

549
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,799
well the next bullet point is

550
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
we plan to move the remainder of the

551
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
drafts into working group last call

552
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,919
and uh i we the chairs think that it

553
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,279
would make sense for the

554
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,880
you as a.d to sort of hold off

555
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,679
publishing the group of drafts to isg

556
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,520
until they've all been collected

557
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
and then published them together so uh

558
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,840
if we were to publish

559
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,799
the um crypto type draft it would really

560
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,240
just be in your queue

561
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,000
and if necessary we could pull it out

562
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,640
and and uh work on it somewhere

563
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,559
okay that was sounds fine yeah makes

564
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,919
sense okay thanks

565
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,559
great and then i'm sort of completing

566
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,000
that second bullet point as

567
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
just stated uh we and also in the agenda

568
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,559
slide maha stated

569
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,400
we do plan to initiate the working group

570
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
last call on the remaining drafts

571
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,919
um my hash if it's easy for you to do

572
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,960
um maybe the the slide that shows i

573
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,480
guess is the title slide the first slide

574
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,159
that has all the list of drafts but

575
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,480
there is a question of if we do all the

576
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
drafts

577
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
in one go so there's a total of six

578
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,039
drafts or we break them up into two

579
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,200
chunks or three chunks perhaps but

580
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,640
if we were to do two chunks you could

581
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,159
imagine tcp ssh tls and http

582
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,600
all being together um and then and then

583
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,520
as a second tranche then that come from

584
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,919
rest conf drafts

585
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:45,279
the um or or do them all together

586
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,399
and in one go and so the what i'll say

587
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,200
is that

588
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,080
the first four drafts are like each

589
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,960
other

590
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
in the sense that um they're all kind of

591
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
transport oriented and they

592
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,640
provide um groupings

593
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,799
that are ultimately used by the net

594
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,240
conflict rest count drafts

595
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,679
and of course the nekop and rest

596
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:06,799
counterapps are the ones that are

597
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,520
providing the

598
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,559
the final um not only just groupings but

599
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,320
containers that that we're using to

600
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,039
configure

601
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,399
that confirmed clients and servers so

602
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,480
really there is an open question to the

603
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,919
working group what would you prefer

604
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,039
in terms of running these in two or

605
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,879
three tranches or altogether

606
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,279
yeah from my perspective i think it

607
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,399
makes sense uh to break it up into

608
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,520
um the four drafts before sending net

609
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
confidence confident to last call

610
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,520
but i'm more than happy to hear what the

611
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,480
work group thinks

612
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
all right go ahead rob so just so

613
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,760
as an individual i i also agree with

614
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,120
what mahesh is saying i think it would

615
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,559
make sense to try and

616
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,919
focus on those four drafts first the

617
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,600
uh tcp ssh tls and http uh but still

618
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,120
allow comments to go into the other

619
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
draft if that came up in that discussion

620
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,320
so maybe try those four

621
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
first and if if it looks like the other

622
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,399
two are required

623
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,080
uh then maybe bring them in later but

624
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
try to do in two steps might get better

625
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,360
reviews i think

626
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,960
that's just yep

627
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
and also just add to that uh those four

628
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,279
drafts are relatively smaller

629
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,120
um than uh that not come from restaurant

630
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,000
crafts

631
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,919
and and and but the netcome from

632
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,600
restaurant crafts share are highly

633
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,960
similar

634
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,559
so anyway okay good let's do that as

635
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
that will be our plan and um so we'll

636
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
plan uh the chairs will plan to kick off

637
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,240
the first four drafts

638
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,640
a workgroup bus call after this

639
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,799
itf110 and with that i think it

640
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,640
concludes my presentation are there any

641
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,520
other open questions or comments and

642
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
if you could quit screen share i'll

643
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,720
start the next uh

644
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,159
next presentation

645
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:23,840
okay soldiers thank you

646
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,279
okay

647
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,559
all right there it is all right so i'll

648
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,600
talk about

649
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,679
the update to the https based transport

650
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,039
for your gang notifications

651
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,480
next slide please so we did a couple of

652
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,200
updates

653
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,840
coming up to zero eight uh to try to

654
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,559
address

655
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,799
the working group last call comments

656
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,760
that we received

657
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
so we did get a lot of comments so thank

658
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,120
everyone um i'll talk a little bit about

659
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,399
the resource urls um that had a few

660
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,000
questions

661
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,480
and same thing with discovery of re

662
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
receiver resources

663
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,159
um and then conclude by

664
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,399
providing some clarification around uh

665
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,679
receiver popular

666
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,200
publisher interaction uh followed by any

667
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
changes

668
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,279
uh not any but the changes that we have

669
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:31,760
made

670
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,440
in the ini consideration section

671
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,000
next slide

672
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,640
all right so as far as the resource url

673
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,760
is concerned

674
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,840
there were a couple of questions on what

675
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,120
was the path

676
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,480
that we were referring to so path is

677
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,519
this configured resource

678
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,760
that is that the publisher needs to know

679
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
upfront

680
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,960
and i give an example here in this case

681
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,080
if the configured

682
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,440
path is some path then with respect to

683
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,399
that

684
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,360
there will be two resources that are

685
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,720
exposed

686
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,320
to the publisher by the receiver

687
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,200
one is the capabilities resource and

688
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,880
which

689
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,159
publisher can do a get request on so its

690
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:24,799
path

691
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,519
in that case would look like a get slash

692
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,240
some path

693
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,919
slash capabilities where

694
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,000
the receiver is able to publish its set

695
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,559
of capabilities

696
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,960
and then the second resource url that is

697
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,039
exposed on that same path

698
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,360
is the ruling notification resource

699
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,720
which is where

700
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,919
a publisher would post

701
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,760
the notifications that it wants to

702
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,840
next slide

703
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,760
so um in order to discover the

704
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,799
receiver capabilities as i mentioned um

705
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,080
of course the publisher would issue a um

706
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,919
get request and if

707
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,200
the receiver has say requested

708
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,360
sorry if the publisher has requested a

709
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
both xml and json

710
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,399
and the receiver supports xml then you

711
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,200
will get the response on the left

712
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,080
if the receiver only supports json it'll

713
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,200
send back a json response on the right

714
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,559
that you see on the right side of the

715
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,720
screen

716
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,320
the um response is very similar

717
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
basically it's publishing a set of

718
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,240
capabilities

719
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,600
and say if it supports all the

720
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,679
capabilities that we talk about in the

721
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,039
draft

722
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,080
then what it should get back those three

723
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,080
capabilities that you see and then

724
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,919
coding for json

725
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,440
and encoding for xml and then encoding

726
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,679
sorry um and the rfc is 8639 39

727
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,560
enabled capability so those three

728
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,800
capabilities would be published

729
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,240
by the receiver

730
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,280
next slide please

731
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,960
so let's talk a little bit about those

732
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,719
receiver capabilities what they

733
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,000
are um so we did introduce a new

734
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,399
capability the rfc 8639 capability

735
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,960
which essentially indicates support for

736
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,679
rfc 8639 state machines

737
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,960
so anything that falls under what

738
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,399
that rfc describes is what would be

739
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,599
supported

740
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,280
by the receiver

741
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,079
if it advertises the xml capability it's

742
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,679
basically indicating support for

743
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,719
notifications in xml format

744
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,240
and if it advertises json

745
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,880
then of course it's saying that i am

746
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,839
capable of

747
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,640
um receiving notifications in json

748
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,119
um the point to note here is that

749
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,160
um and this is this change where

750
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,839
we were talking about notification

751
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,079
messages

752
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,960
now can go ahead and add support for

753
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,280
something like bundle messages

754
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,800
by essentially advertising there

755
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,640
that particular capability in their own

756
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,640
draft

757
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,200
uh in the same ini consideration section

758
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,720
that i'll talk a little bit about

759
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,880
later and by advertising

760
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,680
now the receiver can support

761
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,598
or show support for bundle messages

762
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,520
next slide please

763
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,920
so um you would notice that

764
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,760
with the latest version of the draft we

765
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,960
have trimmed down

766
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,800
um the diagrams and focus really

767
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,800
on um this

768
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,520
very simple interaction of how

769
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,359
notifications

770
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,720
are sent it's a one-way

771
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,640
message as described in 79.50

772
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,839
however http of course by default

773
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,880
requires

774
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
uh a response so hence this document

775
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,560
has defined a 204 no content response

776
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
that http would send back

777
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,640
every time a notification is sent

778
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
uh however other responses are also

779
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,920
possible as

780
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,839
is the case with if there's an

781
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,920
authentication failure

782
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,599
or when not and not authorized

783
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,440
so the question i think to the work

784
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,960
group really is

785
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,320
do they prefer to see as

786
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,599
trying to define the remaining http

787
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,280
responses that should be accepted or not

788
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,880
accepted

789
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,880
or should be sent or not sent by the

790
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,920
receiver

791
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,960
in response to a notification we have

792
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,160
currently left it

793
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
to that we we only

794
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
define what is needed which is the 204

795
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,280
so that's an open question if anyone has

796
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,400
any comments feel free to go ahead and

797
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,480
um comment either here or

798
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,520
on the mailing list

799
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,520
okay i see that as a contributor

800
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,960
um what what other codes would you

801
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,520
think about defining so are there some

802
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,880
standard ones you'd expect

803
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,800
to find or

804
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,160
yes so we um both kent and i

805
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,599
have looked at it we don't believe that

806
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,880
any others need to be documented

807
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,400
per se in our draft

808
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,040
um and i don't know again i don't think

809
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,920
so there's any

810
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,040
else that we expect by default from

811
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,320
um right yeah so rob said

812
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,400
what would we think to define so to be

813
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,960
clear we're not going to define anything

814
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,240
it's only a matter of what other

815
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,880
codes might be used you know because

816
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,359
http is an existing standard

817
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,480
and any of the existing possible http

818
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,119
responses

819
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,760
could be returned um such as on screen

820
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,640
you see

821
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,680
401 not authorized um

822
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
you know there's also others like

823
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,520
resource not available or

824
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,320
you know there's i don't know that it's

825
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,119
possible

826
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,480
it seems to me that a um publisher

827
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,839
an hp s note of publisher would have to

828
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,160
be

829
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,200
effectively a an http client i mean it

830
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,320
is an hp client

831
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,680
and it would have to be capable of

832
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,520
handling the various kinds of

833
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,720
hp responses that would come back

834
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,760
of course the expectation is none of

835
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
those other responses would come back

836
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,640
but they might and we can't prevent it i

837
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,480
don't think in this draft

838
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,119
so we're just sort of uh it's not i

839
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,280
think what mahesh's point is

840
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,320
is um to what extent should this draft

841
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,079
go to um making that statement

842
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,800
and perhaps even further trying to

843
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,839
indicate

844
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,480
under like every possible response or

845
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,280
issues no

846
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,640
known hp response code uh what it might

847
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,040
mean

848
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,680
or how it could be i mean if there's any

849
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,040
semantic

850
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,640
you know behavioral uh

851
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,200
uh impact above and beyond what http

852
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
defines i don't think so but

853
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
i think that's what match is leading up

854
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,879
to

855
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,320
so so i think my question is what

856
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,480
what's what's the publisher expected to

857
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,599
do if they

858
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,520
get different codes are they expected to

859
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
write different handing for those or

860
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,800
they meant to handle them all the same

861
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,119
way

862
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,760
well i would imagine that the the

863
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,319
handling would be done by the http

864
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,839
client itself

865
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,119
and um

866
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
that i think the the response would

867
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,280
really be at that level from a uh

868
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,400
implementation for this particular draft

869
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
perspective i don't think so there's

870
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,520
anything that the draft is going

871
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,240
is guiding towards in terms of response

872
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,599
it's whatever needs to

873
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,640
be declined well maybe uh

874
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
to rob okay so if you look at hpe status

875
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,680
codes they're

876
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,000
grouped into categories so there's the

877
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,960
one um

878
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,440
xx the two to x three x x four x six

879
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,400
five x axis

880
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,119
so four x x is client errors and five x

881
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:57,599
axis

882
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,640
server side errors so client error you

883
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,040
know

884
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,200
like 401 not authorized i mean you

885
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,960
that's something a client would you know

886
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
i think pretty much on the onus of the

887
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,640
client or shall we say the

888
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,839
publisher to handle any and all possible

889
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,440
client um errors from a server error

890
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,480
perspective

891
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,319
um you know for instance maybe the back

892
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,160
end database that the server is writing

893
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,040
into

894
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,920
uh is full and it can it can't uh

895
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,480
persist

896
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,920
the log or for something like that i

897
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,160
don't know um and for some reason or

898
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,119
another it it

899
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,200
returns a five um xx type error to

900
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,040
the client effectively saying i'm not

901
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
able to process this request

902
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,280
um what would the client do in that uh

903
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,800
in order to the publisher do in that

904
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,680
that instance and

905
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
and maybe what you're suggesting is does

906
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,880
that entail

907
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,160
uh buffering on the client uh you know

908
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
until as and when it's able to deliver

909
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,680
that message or something like that is

910
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,480
that where

911
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,000
you're thinking the draft should go into

912
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,440
that level of detail and um

913
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,280
uh no not necessarily i think my

914
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,960
question is more is if there is some

915
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,720
defined behavior that

916
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,280
that client's expected to take uh or

917
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,800
publish i want confusing three around

918
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,359
this is

919
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:11,839
um then that's worth specifying if it's

920
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,400
if it's

921
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,680
if they handle it all the same way

922
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,240
regardless or if that's what has been

923
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,440
specified elsewhere then i don't think

924
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,200
it needs to be restated here

925
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,280
so i guess it's worth specifying if some

926
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,359
action needs to be taken otherwise

927
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,680
not

928
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,960
okay

929
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,920
well i think um i mean as an author i

930
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,200
think it makes sense

931
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,319
for us to um

932
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,880
state that for any of the servers client

933
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,040
server errors the 5x category

934
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,599
of errors this draft is not itself

935
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,640
defining

936
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,040
the need for any buffering to occur

937
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:58,400
okay that sounds reasonable

938
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,119
all right um next slide

939
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,280
all right i think i believe the next

940
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,760
slide which

941
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,640
can scroll into yes is the ionic

942
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,800
consideration section

943
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,160
so we did

944
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,920
modify the anna consideration section um

945
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,440
we

946
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,720
of course have the registry to register

947
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,119
the

948
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,400
yang model but now a new

949
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,480
registry has been added to define the

950
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,000
capability you are in

951
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,400
that we talked about a couple of slides

952
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,599
ago

953
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,400
and it of course has been initialized

954
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,839
with the three warrants

955
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,160
the three capabilities that we talked

956
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,480
about a couple of slides ago

957
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,200
so that's the change as far as the ionic

958
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,160
consideration

959
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,520
section is concerned um

960
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,839
we do have some outstanding comments and

961
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,200
that we will

962
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,280
meet the authors kent and i will respond

963
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,480
to

964
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,599
after this meeting to address any the

965
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,160
remaining

966
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,800
last call comments but at that point i

967
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,359
believe

968
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,400
um we would have addressed any and all

969
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,800
remaining comments

970
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,760
um so that's as far as the status of

971
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,160
this

972
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,680
draft is concerned any other comments

973
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,480
or questions

974
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,319
all right if not then

975
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,480
we can get to the next item

976
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,520
sure and the hash as a contributor i

977
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,800
just noticed that um

978
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,079
the encoding sorry the urn for the uh

979
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,200
8639 encoding i'm sorry

980
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,359
supported that we the urn actually used

981
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,960
the word encoding into it it's not

982
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,400
actually an encoding so

983
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,960
we should change the title of that urine

984
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,599
yeah

985
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,040
okay all right so let's bring up the

986
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,839
next

987
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,800
presentation

988
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,800
and just do like that

989
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:19,839
all right

990
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,040
okay here we go

991
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,400
all right looks good

992
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,359
okay okay

993
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,480
come here me yep we hear you yes

994
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,280
but i can't see this okay okay i see the

995
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,640
slice

996
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,359
uh okay hello uh this is pony from china

997
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,560
mobile and

998
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,200
i'd like to introduce the draft of

999
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,319
telemetry edit

1000
00:45:50,319 --> 00:46:01,839
export capability excise please

1001
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,119
oh okay so i can't see the slide change

1002
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,040
maybe network

1003
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,079
has some problem so is it a

1004
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,520
slice too it's on the recap slide

1005
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,240
but you're right i think there's a delay

1006
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,160
okay

1007
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,480
let's have a recap first and the

1008
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,359
motivation

1009
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:24,079
is that the notification capability mode

1010
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,520
defined in the

1011
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,599
net curve notification capabilities

1012
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:28,560
allow

1013
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,800
a client to discover a set of

1014
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,000
capabilities

1015
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,880
such as transport independent session

1016
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,680
level supported by the server

1017
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,240
but some transport specific parameters

1018
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,200
are lacked

1019
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,000
such as transport protocol encoding

1020
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,560
format and the encryption

1021
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,160
so the goal of data export quality is to

1022
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,640
augment system capabilities mode and

1023
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,200
provide

1024
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,640
additional data export attributes for

1025
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,280
transport dependent capability

1026
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,119
negotiation

1027
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:10,800
next slide please

1028
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,319
um okay uh this draft was second

1029
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,640
presented in the last meeting and a few

1030
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,480
issues were discussed

1031
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,040
and first is to support multiple

1032
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,680
transport

1033
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,400
protocols advertisement from the server

1034
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,319
to the client

1035
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,680
a second is whether to insert a hint

1036
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,400
into error response described in the rfc

1037
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,960
a639 which will be introduced later

1038
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,240
and the latest version is

1039
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,040
running three and changes compared to

1040
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,400
the prime

1041
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,079
years versions uh um first we change

1042
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:48,559
data

1043
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,200
export capabilities into list type to

1044
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,640
support

1045
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,599
multiple transport protocol encoding on

1046
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,839
the server

1047
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,280
and second is adding usage example of

1048
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,400
interaction with odp-based transport for

1049
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,920
configured subscript subscription

1050
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,800
which can be formed in the appendix in

1051
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,680
the draft

1052
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,280
and third we add thomas as a contributor

1053
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,359
and first we update motivation in the

1054
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,839
introduction to clarify why this work is

1055
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,200
needed

1056
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,359
it is because i'm guaranteed of

1057
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:26,400
inserting hands

1058
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,960
into error response so this document

1059
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,599
defines a corresponding solution that is

1060
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,119
built on top credibility of the

1061
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,920
existing draft netcom notification

1062
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,960
capabilities

1063
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,760
and finally we add the support udp and

1064
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,599
http notification

1065
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,240
as two optional transport in the yum

1066
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,720
data model next slide please

1067
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,480
so here are two issues that need to be

1068
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,520
clarified

1069
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,480
and first is multiple transport protocol

1070
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,760
support

1071
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,920
we got the question that in some cases

1072
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,960
the server may

1073
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,160
support multiple transport protocols so

1074
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,160
how does the server advertise

1075
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,760
multiple transport protocol supported to

1076
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,119
the

1077
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,800
we give client example both udp and http

1078
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,079
notification are supported by the server

1079
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,440
so we propose that change data export

1080
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,160
capabilities

1081
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:30,880
from container

1082
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,720
and type to the uh this time to support

1083
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,760
multiple transpo transport protocols

1084
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,400
and with this transport protocol

1085
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,240
capability advertisement

1086
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,640
the client know which transport protocol

1087
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,760
is need

1088
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,839
to specify in the established

1089
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,920
subscription rpc or

1090
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,920
modify a subsequent subscription of rpc

1091
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,839
next time please

1092
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,319
okay

1093
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,839
because another issue is uh inserting

1094
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:14,720
came

1095
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,720
into error response um as described in

1096
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,599
section 3.1 of the existing rc

1097
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,319
uh simple negotiation for example

1098
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,559
inserting hands into error response to a

1099
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,640
field office request

1100
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,400
between subscribers and publishers for

1101
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
subscription parameters increase the

1102
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,359
likelihood of success for

1103
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,480
a subsequent rpc request but not

1104
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,680
guaranteed

1105
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,800
which may cause unexpected failure or

1106
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,720
additional message exchange between the

1107
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,520
client and server

1108
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,119
so introduce telemetry transport

1109
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,680
capability advertisement increase

1110
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,119
likelihood of success

1111
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,760
of the first episode request and reduce

1112
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,079
the number of subscription message

1113
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,160
to be exchanged between them

1114
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,440
and but at the cost of uh

1115
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,480
introducing advertisement message before

1116
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,760
the netcup or last cup session is

1117
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,839
established so next time please

1118
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,119
so we will address any comments

1119
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,880
receiving in the meeting and

1120
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,079
can we request call adoption on this

1121
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:51,839
document and any comments

1122
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,920
go ahead tim hi yes so this is tim

1123
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
carrey i do have a question

1124
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,800
um regarding uh just uh just if

1125
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,400
if everything was taken care of i saw

1126
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,880
that you did uh

1127
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
look at the multiple uh transports and

1128
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,079
coding

1129
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,400
uh situation where you were where you

1130
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,440
had one before

1131
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,640
that was brought up by i believe rob uh

1132
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,960
on the last meeting but there was also

1133
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,400
some outstanding issues

1134
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,559
with respect to uh the uh

1135
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,119
adoption of this thing uh and uh

1136
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,720
discussions that were happening through

1137
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,760
uh the online email were those

1138
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,599
issues resolved uh regarding

1139
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,520
specifically the complexity and if

1140
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,160
weather was really needed and some of

1141
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:36,559
the

1142
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,119
unnecessary subscription exchange were i

1143
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:39,760
didn't see

1144
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,559
anything in there that was uh resolved

1145
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,760
or not

1146
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,800
could you comment on that hi uh

1147
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,440
tim this is the chin can you hear me yes

1148
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,359
okay yeah let me clarify a little bit

1149
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,800
actually we

1150
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,119
discussed two issues for second issue

1151
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,079
actually you

1152
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,200
mentioned by uh this brought up by the

1153
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,040
robot we have already addressed to

1154
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,319
support a multiple

1155
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,480
transfer protocol and encoding for for

1156
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,520
the first issue

1157
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,559
actually we uh also you know discuss you

1158
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,119
know

1159
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,040
uh the existing solutions that that'll

1160
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,920
be proposing

1161
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,599
obviously actually it is actually

1162
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,720
inserted error

1163
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:24,160
response into uh into the response

1164
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,640
message actually we

1165
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,440
maybe we can go back a little bit uh the

1166
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:29,839
first

1167
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,000
issue actually we we can take a look at

1168
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,240
that

1169
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,760
yeah so we will verify this uh uh

1170
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,319
oh not on this one the second second the

1171
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:43,119
issue two

1172
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,839
sorry yeah

1173
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,920
so if this solution is inserted kindly

1174
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,119
into the error message

1175
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,559
error response actually but but you know

1176
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,760
we think you know it may cause uh

1177
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,359
some out you know it actually

1178
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,160
may not guarantee to be successful for

1179
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:04,640
the

1180
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,000
second second around the rpc request so

1181
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,640
if we can introduce this uh capability

1182
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,599
advertisement

1183
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,160
so for the first rpc actually we

1184
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,160
increase the likelihood of success

1185
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,200
but uh we verify for for this actually

1186
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,880
you you have some cost that you you need

1187
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,960
to

1188
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,839
also need to succeed this advertisement

1189
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,119
message but

1190
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,599
we this message actually based on the

1191
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,280
young person notification

1192
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,599
that has already been standards in uh bb

1193
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,480
discussed in

1194
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,400
the nether culver actually this is a

1195
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,559
course that we should you know

1196
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,520
uh satisfy but we also have benefit you

1197
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,000
know

1198
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,760
uh increases the the likelihood of

1199
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,760
success for the first ibc

1200
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,119
uh request so this is something we

1201
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,520
discuss and also you know clarify in the

1202
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,160
introduction

1203
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,960
section and motivate for the motivation

1204
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,359
so

1205
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,200
we we simply addressed that this issue

1206
00:54:59,200 --> 00:54:59,839
also we

1207
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,119
post the the the draft for

1208
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,119
on the list and for for working good

1209
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:06,400
review and

1210
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,280
i haven't seen any uh objection yeah

1211
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,920
but did you answer your question yeah

1212
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,319
yeah

1213
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:15,839
so i just wanted to make sure but did

1214
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,400
you directly go back to i think it was

1215
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,000
andy that had these objections

1216
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,520
before did you go back and verify the

1217
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,920
um the solution with with andy who had

1218
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,119
the direct

1219
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,799
uh question or concern

1220
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:34,000
uh we we haven't given feedback

1221
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,040
on the list publicly for this

1222
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,280
but we we did we didn't you know posted

1223
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,880
this update and

1224
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,799
mentioned which addressed this issue on

1225
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,920
the list yeah

1226
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,200
thank you thank you

1227
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,760
so tim what i think uh vhs can do is i

1228
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,760
we can ask andy specifically if his

1229
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,559
issues have been addressed or not

1230
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,960
yeah that's all i'm just i'm i just had

1231
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,200
that documented from last time was that

1232
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,680
um there was some concerns still and i

1233
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,040
just wanted to make sure that

1234
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,920
um you know that the people's direct

1235
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,599
concerns were validated

1236
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,119
with the people that made those concerns

1237
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,160
okay thank you yeah

1238
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,760
so jin i had a question um so

1239
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,799
for the first issue that you talk about

1240
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,000
where you want to support so

1241
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,599
what is the scenario in which

1242
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,839
a publisher might want to choose between

1243
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,160
different transport mechanisms at the

1244
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:44,880
time

1245
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,680
i learned the capabilities and then

1246
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,799
choose

1247
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,920
generally wouldn't the publisher already

1248
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,839
know which kind of transport

1249
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,720
it wants to use

1250
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,480
yeah this is something we also you know

1251
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,640
discussed about your your job to

1252
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,319
actually be notified we think

1253
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:10,000
you know uh you you you can discover the

1254
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,240
receiver capability for us actually the

1255
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,599
server also can

1256
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,760
otherwise advertise their capabilities

1257
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,799
so

1258
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,520
so these compute advertisement can be

1259
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,040
leveraged by the

1260
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:25,359
uh by the young push

1261
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,040
subscription for example you you

1262
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,559
establish subscription you need to

1263
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:29,040
decide

1264
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,119
what kind of encoding you should choose

1265
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,480
or what kind of transport you

1266
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,280
you want to select and you can leverage

1267
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:35,920
this

1268
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,160
uh computer advertisement from the

1269
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:38,960
server

1270
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,599
yeah that's our scenario okay

1271
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,760
this is kent as a contributor jen you

1272
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,799
just mentioned

1273
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,680
established description i know that that

1274
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,000
is

1275
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,480
a notification a yang notification

1276
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,000
statement defined in

1277
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,119
yang push i think um

1278
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,760
but uh when using for instance that the

1279
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,920
https notif draft

1280
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,920
um these are one-way messages

1281
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,400
uh it's a one-way flow of messages

1282
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,680
there's no response

1283
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,839
uh you i know we were talking earlier

1284
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,720
about um http status codes and

1285
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,280
you know four x-axis and five x-type

1286
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,480
responses but

1287
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,599
there's actually no um application level

1288
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,400
response

1289
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,359
like uh containing a payload that the

1290
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,119
receiver could communicate anything to

1291
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:32,000
the publisher

1292
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,319
is that in any way a concern or an issue

1293
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,599
with regards to this work

1294
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,880
yeah i think both work has such a

1295
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,319
limitation actually is a one-way message

1296
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,119
actually but

1297
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,559
you know i i think we talked with thomas

1298
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,240
because they have a udp

1299
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,720
native actually they really want to you

1300
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:53,440
know uh

1301
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,440
bet on sending water server support for

1302
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,160
the encoding so they can leverage these

1303
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,640
uh several advertisements for the

1304
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,280
encoding

1305
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,559
uh so i i think another concern

1306
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,799
so for my side actually the the

1307
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,640
i'm not sure we really want to define

1308
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,839
you know uh

1309
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,319
two-way message to address this i i

1310
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,119
think

1311
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,599
uh just like you know young pushy

1312
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,640
notification this

1313
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,040
is just a one-way message this is a

1314
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,480
foundation we can leverage it

1315
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,640
i know thomas isn't on the call anymore

1316
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:30,960
but

1317
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,319
it it does seem that the udp notif and

1318
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,280
and for that matter

1319
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,200
any other future um no transport notif

1320
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,240
uh that we might define um

1321
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,720
that they would want i think follow the

1322
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,359
pattern

1323
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:48,400
that the https draft is using

1324
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,040
whereby there's a something like a get

1325
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,559
capabilities

1326
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,680
which for the case of a udp notif would

1327
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,839
would have to be probably a tcp oriented

1328
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:02,480
request um perhaps

1329
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,960
i mean that could be discussed but uh

1330
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,599
but then

1331
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,200
the actual flow of notifications begins

1332
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,119
using udp um and uh but so i mean that

1333
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:14,000
that kind of makes

1334
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,760
sense and something i would expect to be

1335
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,079
defined inside the udp node of draft as

1336
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,839
being part of that work

1337
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,040
is it um then the

1338
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,440
is would that then be an overlap with

1339
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,160
what you're

1340
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,680
describing here no actually we didn't

1341
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,200
discuss with thomas uh

1342
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,400
you know about this actually the

1343
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,440
we actually you know uh

1344
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,040
so so for you different native actually

1345
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,880
they can leverage uh

1346
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,480
the mechanism defined in this draft to

1347
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,920
uh do the you know uh uh server

1348
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,200
capability discovery actually uh i

1349
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,400
i think there's no overlap and either uh

1350
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,440
you did or reference this draft or or

1351
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,720
this java reference

1352
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,520
udpnotif i'm okay with this

1353
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,559
then does that then beg the question of

1354
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:09,040
if the

1355
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,720
hvs notif should not define the

1356
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,839
get capabilities resource and

1357
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,520
instead point to this draft

1358
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,839
yeah that's one option actually i i

1359
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,680
think

1360
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,319
yeah i haven't thought about this issue

1361
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,440
actually i i think

1362
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,480
we we can talk about this how how do you

1363
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,280
leverage this

1364
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,720
server capability i think your your

1365
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,680
your uh maximum in actually native

1366
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,559
actually

1367
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,920
they provide the receiver discovery

1368
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,920
and uh so this is something we

1369
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,920
uh i haven't i haven't seen single thing

1370
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,040
about this issue

1371
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,160
maybe yeah

1372
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,078
i will take a look look at this yeah

1373
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,119
okay well as you know we're near the

1374
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:03,039
working group last call on that draft

1375
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,079
and uh but i mean as a contributor

1376
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,280
i think that um it makes sense for each

1377
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,920
node of transport to define its own

1378
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,359
mechanism for how um it would discover

1379
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,680
the capabilities of the receiver but i

1380
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,280
don't know if

1381
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,400
okay i'll just leave with that

1382
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:30,000
yeah any other comments

1383
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,039
i mean anybody

1384
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,079
okay tim but but

1385
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,039
just to follow up on kent question right

1386
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,799
so if you don't do that kent then

1387
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,160
what's the value of this draft if if if

1388
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,040
the other drafts would define their own

1389
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,280
[Music]

1390
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,319
uh mechanisms

1391
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,319
did i miss something here kent no well i

1392
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,599
mean that is the question

1393
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,480
and why i asked him but the response was

1394
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:00,960
not

1395
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,000
um solid and so i

1396
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,680
would it makes me question if you know

1397
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,839
uh it seems like we want to go all one

1398
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,359
way or all the other way

1399
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,680
right um and uh but and but my intuition

1400
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,440
is that that would prob

1401
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,839
that that it makes it like for instance

1402
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:22,799
with the hp

1403
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,839
s sorry yeah the hps notif

1404
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,599
the mechanism that's used to get the

1405
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:28,960
capabilities

1406
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,559
is https and it's you know it's

1407
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,640
kind of baked into that protocol if you

1408
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,280
were to do for instance a grpc

1409
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:40,720
um notice you would probably use a grpc

1410
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,680
request

1411
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,520
if you're using you know you know so for

1412
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,039
each transport could be

1413
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,920
a transport uh oriented way about going

1414
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:48,480
about

1415
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,520
uh you know learning the the

1416
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,640
capabilities

1417
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,039
so so my intuition is that we'd probably

1418
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:55,920
want

1419
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,880
maybe to have allow each transport to

1420
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,680
have its own

1421
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,680
to define its own mechanism for doing

1422
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,960
that

1423
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,000
um but uh

1424
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,920
so that's that's the quandary i guess

1425
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,119
where i'm at right now

1426
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,319
and to that i'll add that what if

1427
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,160
a particular new draft transport trap

1428
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,960
comes along and wants to define a new

1429
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,240
capability

1430
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,520
does and do we then review rev

1431
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,839
this particular draft to add that new

1432
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:29,279
capability at that point

1433
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,480
uh yeah i i think for our job there

1434
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,400
right now we support a udv node event

1435
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,880
hdb node before there's new

1436
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,480
uh transporter we can you know add it

1437
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,599
actually in as a one option

1438
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,160
no problem

1439
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,119
as chair i see that benoit's posted

1440
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,000
something to the chat

1441
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,839
window but then well i don't actually

1442
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,760
understand exactly what you're

1443
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,839
what you're saying do you think he could

1444
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:09,839
um speak to mike

1445
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,680
um i mean oh okay go ahead

1446
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,839
i don't hear benoit

1447
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,599
maybe he's on mute locally robert i see

1448
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,039
that you're also cute did he want to say

1449
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,359
something

1450
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,359
yeah yes as a contributor i think this

1451
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,640
is an interesting question

1452
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,760
more generally about how we manage

1453
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,119
capabilities of servers

1454
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,200
and how those are reported and exported

1455
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,319
i think that

1456
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,680
at the moment it seems like there's

1457
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,440
different approaches to that problem and

1458
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,799
certainly i think it's probably worth

1459
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,720
having some further discussion

1460
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,880
to find uh one way to do this

1461
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,760
um i have concern you know as you see

1462
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,960
you've got your draft to work with last

1463
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,079
call at the moment

1464
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:04,960
that's defining one mechanism um but if

1465
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,559
we decide to do a different way then

1466
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,480
that that's a potential issue but i

1467
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,720
i does feel to me that we should come up

1468
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,240
with a common solution to this

1469
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,960
rather than um doing it differently for

1470
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:19,839
different sorts of capabilities

1471
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,359
one thing i'll note is in rfc

1472
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:32,799
8639 in the uh configure descriptions

1473
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,319
yang module

1474
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:37,200
for each subscriber uh sorry for each

1475
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,480
description

1476
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,359
there's a leaf called encoding which is

1477
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,799
an identity ref

1478
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,640
and defined values are xml and json

1479
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,720
the description statement for that leaf

1480
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,680
says

1481
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,400
that oh and i should note that that leaf

1482
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,920
is under a when

1483
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,839
statement and so who whichever draft is

1484
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:59,359
defining the identity

1485
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:01,470
can choose as to whether or not

1486
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:03,280
[Music]

1487
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,280
sorry whenever a draft is defining a

1488
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,079
transport such as https notice

1489
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,839
it can choose as to whether or not that

1490
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,280
leaf

1491
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,559
is configurable if it's even visible the

1492
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,400
when statement will disable the the

1493
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,039
presence of that that that leaf of the

1494
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,960
encoding leaf is not there

1495
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,319
so this was discussed uh some

1496
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,640
by the authors and you know it seemed

1497
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,440
that

1498
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,720
the static configuring or statically

1499
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,680
configuring

1500
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:35,280
the encoding xml versus json was less

1501
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,480
desirable

1502
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,760
than a dynamically learned response that

1503
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,039
you know you could

1504
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,000
obtain the from the public sorry the

1505
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,200
receiver

1506
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,480
what encodings it supports that way and

1507
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:48,799
then

1508
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:51,920
have a more dynamic response so

1509
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,680
the hps notice draft

1510
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,240
does not when it when it goes to define

1511
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,160
that identity it does not do it in a way

1512
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,359
that enables the when

1513
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:04,039
statement and and hence the

1514
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:05,280
configurability

1515
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,920
of that encoding leaf is not possible

1516
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,680
when using the hps notif

1517
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,039
transport and um

1518
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,720
and but then further on i mean so we

1519
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,080
could suss

1520
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,238
the details out of that but also note

1521
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,679
that the

1522
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,319
there's a there's other capabilities

1523
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,679
above and beyond

1524
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,759
those of just encoding like if the

1525
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,759
encoding is json versus xml

1526
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,679
there's also for instance we as defined

1527
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,198
in our draft already

1528
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,560
the um if you support the 8639 state

1529
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,679
machine

1530
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,560
potentially there could be also if you

1531
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,000
support bundled messages

1532
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,719
headers and things like that so there's

1533
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,359
a multiplicity of kinds of capabilities

1534
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:45,920
or

1535
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,960
beyond the scope of encodings so i'm not

1536
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,238
really taking away from what you've just

1537
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:50,560
said

1538
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,640
robert i'm just adding more context to

1539
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,158
it

1540
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:57,359
go ahead uh uh yes exa

1541
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,198
exactly and i think as you s that's the

1542
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,799
key point to me is that in terms of

1543
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,000
capabilities

1544
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,920
we have one base capabilities draft and

1545
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,279
we have another one adding

1546
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,839
some extra color to that but there's a

1547
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:08,479
whole

1548
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,040
scope of capabilities that device has in

1549
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,080
terms of

1550
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,759
uh configuration and what it's doing

1551
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:15,359
things like that and i wonder whether we

1552
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,960
need to have a more holistic view

1553
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,640
of all those capabilities and work out

1554
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,158
what the best way of expressing those is

1555
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,080
in yang

1556
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:23,920
i just worry that we will take a

1557
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,520
piecemeal approach here

1558
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,040
we've got some base capabilities we've

1559
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,120
got some that are extending it for

1560
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,158
uh telemetry we've got the um

1561
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,000
notice drafts and things that are doing

1562
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,198
their own capabilities

1563
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:36,560
i'm wondering whether we should have a

1564
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,319
look at trying to

1565
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,198
work out what the uh solution to the

1566
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:42,238
entire space is

1567
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,759
rather than solving each bit

1568
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:49,839
independently is what i was thinking of

1569
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,080
okay so um kent actually me when i

1570
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,480
look at the bino's comment what he's

1571
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,280
saying is that

1572
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,880
uh he he actually agrees with you that

1573
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,320
it makes sense to

1574
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,840
have discover capability so the

1575
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,560
approach that say the http is not a

1576
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,600
draft

1577
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,280
has taken um and i think binocular

1578
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,840
speak for himself so i'll let him do it

1579
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:17,520
but that's my interpretation

1580
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,880
go ahead right so it's exactly my view

1581
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,360
right so uh okay we're defining netconf

1582
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,840
and roscom for notifications right

1583
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,679
but trying to get and this i want to

1584
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,080
react to what you said the last sentence

1585
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,920
can't you know maybe three or five

1586
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,320
minutes ago telling it's important to

1587
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,400
have discovery capabilities

1588
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,159
right and it's important for a telemetry

1589
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,960
for transport and a draft that rob

1590
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,400
mentioned to you for

1591
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,000
object as well so i don't want to

1592
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,400
position myself one holistic view or not

1593
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,080
but i'm just stressing

1594
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,080
whenever we want to solve the next step

1595
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,760
of network management is intended

1596
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:56,800
assurance

1597
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,280
need to rely on those capabilities and

1598
01:10:59,280 --> 01:10:59,840
maybe

1599
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,480
make sense to a holistic view but i'm

1600
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,080
just saying that we're going to see more

1601
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,360
and more of those

1602
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,000
capabilities discovery i guess

1603
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,199
so as a contributor i i think i

1604
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,600
understand or that um

1605
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,360
dynamic discovery is preferred over

1606
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,520
static discovery is what i think

1607
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,600
you're saying but the mechanism for

1608
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,120
dynamic discovery

1609
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:26,320
uh holistic versus per node of transport

1610
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,520
that's something that we should probably

1611
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,400
look at more deeply

1612
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:37,760
is that correct benoit that's correct

1613
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,840
thank you

1614
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,080
okay so with that i think we've

1615
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,760
completed um

1616
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,040
this drafts presentation unless there's

1617
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,400
any other comments i'm gonna

1618
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,839
start bringing up the next

1619
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,519
hello can you hear me

1620
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,719
hello yeah

1621
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:22,719
okay um could you please open the slides

1622
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,719
yeah so kent is trying to bring up the

1623
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,239
slides

1624
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:37,839
okay thank you

1625
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,400
hello everyone this is chufama and i'm

1626
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,600
here to

1627
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,719
present our draft adaptive subscription

1628
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,560
to young notification

1629
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,840
that's right please

1630
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,400
to give a recap here young push

1631
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,360
has defined the two subscription modes

1632
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,239
periodic

1633
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,440
and unchanged subscription however

1634
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,000
in some cases there is a need for a

1635
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,960
service

1636
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,040
to configure both collectors and the

1637
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,800
publishers with multiple

1638
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,440
period intervals and automatically

1639
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,000
switch

1640
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,800
to different different period intervals

1641
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,960
according to resource usage

1642
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,679
for example thinking about a wireless

1643
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:23,840
network performance case

1644
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,400
when the wireless signal stress falls

1645
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:26,880
below

1646
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,280
or configure the low water mark the

1647
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,679
subscribe data can be streamed

1648
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,199
at a higher rate however the while when

1649
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:37,600
the wireless synchronous stress across

1650
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,480
is a

1651
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,600
configured high water mark

1652
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,640
the subscribe data can be streamed at a

1653
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,159
lower rate

1654
01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:50,880
for the the first case we think that

1655
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,520
we would like the data to be streamed at

1656
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,760
a higher rate so that we can

1657
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,560
get enough telemetry data to detect and

1658
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,880
diagnose the network problem

1659
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,320
but in the second case we

1660
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,719
would like the telemetry data to be

1661
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:08,480
streamed at a lower rate

1662
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,280
so that so as to save network resources

1663
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:11,600
like

1664
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,560
bandwidth therefore we propose a new

1665
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,320
subscription mode

1666
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,040
and we also define a young data model

1667
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:19,360
and

1668
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,320
associated mechanism to enable

1669
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,360
subscribers

1670
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,000
adaptive subscription and a live

1671
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,320
publisher to automatically adjust the

1672
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,199
volume of telemetry traffic

1673
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,159
last slide please

1674
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:40,080
regarding document status this is our

1675
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,800
third time

1676
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,719
to present to present this work

1677
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,640
and in the itf 109 meeting we clarify

1678
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,800
the relation between this work

1679
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,159
and eca and and

1680
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,800
a common understanding has been reached

1681
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,239
but still we have

1682
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:02,000
two issues addressed during the itf

1683
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,520
round9 meeting

1684
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,640
is there any alternative solution and

1685
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,040
how client initiated a modified

1686
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,239
subscription

1687
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:13,440
is different from this work regarding

1688
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,159
the second issue many thanks to thomas

1689
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:16,719
for

1690
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,400
arranging the meeting after the itf one

1691
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:20,880
night

1692
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,520
so that we can reach an agreement with

1693
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,840
the proposed change

1694
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,719
the recent progress we have met is

1695
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,600
reflected on the latest update variant

1696
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,640
3.

1697
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,840
we clarify the difference

1698
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,400
differences between low priority

1699
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,400
telemetry data

1700
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,880
dropping and collection red reach

1701
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,760
switching in the introduction session

1702
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,040
and update the abstract and

1703
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,360
introduction session to focus on

1704
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,000
collection with switching in the

1705
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,320
server without interaction with the

1706
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,840
remote client

1707
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,199
and other editorial changes next slide

1708
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,840
please

1709
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,080
our main idea here is that when the data

1710
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,360
collection rate

1711
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,560
is too high it becomes more likely that

1712
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,600
a burst of stream data may temporarily

1713
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,120
overwhelm a receiver

1714
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:24,480
and consume expensive network results

1715
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,960
but when the rate at which we can

1716
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:27,520
collect

1717
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,640
a stream of data is set too low

1718
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,120
these telemetry data are not sufficient

1719
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,159
to detect and

1720
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:37,280
diagnose problems and verify

1721
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,320
correct network behavior

1722
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,199
an alternative a solution is to

1723
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,320
prioritize a telemetry data collection

1724
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,120
and get loyal priority telemetric data

1725
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,280
dropped

1726
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,920
it use uses fixed telemetry data

1727
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,880
collection rate

1728
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,679
or fixed update interval however it is

1729
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:58,000
not

1730
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,040
sufficient to detect and diagnose the

1731
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,120
problems and verifying correct

1732
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,400
network behavior and another

1733
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:10,159
alternative is to use client initiative

1734
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,000
to establish subscription

1735
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,199
or modify subscription rpc

1736
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:18,320
we think that it has slow response to

1737
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,840
the network condition

1738
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,159
change the current established

1739
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,080
subscription rpc

1740
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,480
does not support update interval

1741
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,320
switching

1742
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,679
so you have to do the augment establish

1743
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,360
subscription rpc

1744
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,000
to allow the client switch to switch the

1745
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,560
update

1746
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,480
interval so in a nutshell we think that

1747
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,280
this issue has been resolved in the

1748
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:45,120
current region

1749
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,000
next slide please

1750
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,960
the key values of adaptive subscription

1751
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,080
is that it addresses performance

1752
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,719
bottleneck on the device when facing

1753
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,239
massive data collection

1754
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,520
and process and it also automatically

1755
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,880
adjusts the

1756
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,520
volume of telemetry traffic sent from

1757
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,560
publisher to the receiver and

1758
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,520
it gradually reduced the amount of data

1759
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,000
to be exported

1760
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,880
the authors believe that this draft has

1761
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,840
been

1762
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,440
ready to move forward so i would like

1763
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,559
here to request the adoption call and in

1764
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,040
comments

1765
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,920
hi this is kent as a contributor i'm

1766
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,080
wondering about your previous issue

1767
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,840
and since i'm driving the slides i'll

1768
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,760
just scroll back up to it

1769
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:53,600
um you mentioned that

1770
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,400
the alternative solution point number

1771
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,000
the second bullet point

1772
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,120
is to use client initiated established

1773
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,760
description to modify subscription rpcs

1774
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,280
so in the case of the https notif

1775
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,480
or the udp note of drafts both of which

1776
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,760
are effectively

1777
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,280
one way are you then envisioning

1778
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,000
the receiver having a secondary

1779
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,719
connection

1780
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,560
to the server i'm sorry to the publisher

1781
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,679
um so that it can then send these rpcs

1782
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,159
messages

1783
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,440
uh yes the

1784
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,960
if if it is in the two-way

1785
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,159
subscription then you can the client can

1786
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,239
use the modify subscription but

1787
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:46,000
in the udp or itp subscription case

1788
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,840
and the client may use the established

1789
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,400
subscription

1790
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,760
but it needs to change the uh augmented

1791
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,480
the ipc

1792
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,239
to allow this client to switch the

1793
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:59,040
update interval

1794
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,719
right okay yeah just saying that looks

1795
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,320
slightly different sorry just one second

1796
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:02,800
again

1797
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,159
i'm just saying that uh we're repeating

1798
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:07,199
back um when it's a dynamics description

1799
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,880
uh that's uh when you know um the the

1800
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,520
receiver is already a rest conference

1801
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,520
client and it's connecting and then

1802
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,600
respectively over the existing

1803
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,560
netcomfort

1804
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,320
connection and starts to receive the

1805
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,600
flow of

1806
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,679
notifications then of course it makes

1807
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,360
sense to send these

1808
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:28,080
establishes modify subscription messages

1809
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,199
over that

1810
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,000
but when it's a configured description

1811
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,320
so

1812
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,040
the flow of logs or notifications are

1813
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:35,760
occurring

1814
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,000
out the back end there need to be a

1815
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,120
secondary

1816
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,719
netconf restaurant connection on the top

1817
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,040
side in order to affect the changes

1818
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:46,080
that's my understanding uh yeah

1819
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,480
uh okay ken you are correct actually i

1820
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:49,920
just want to clarify for

1821
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,159
dynamic uh subscription actually we're

1822
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,920
not supposed to have a second

1823
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,800
connection we still use the existing uh

1824
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,880
connection actually but you can you

1825
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,920
use the modified subscription to to

1826
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,840
change some of the parameters still

1827
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,520
maintain the same connection but for

1828
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:15,840
configure separation i agree with you

1829
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,520
so sorry i'm just thinking about this so

1830
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,159
some of

1831
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:25,679
um the the publisher is aware of some of

1832
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:26,159
the con

1833
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,800
issues of congestion with related to for

1834
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,239
instance if the tcp

1835
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:33,360
right buffer is overflowing that's an

1836
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,239
indication of a problem

1837
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,080
potentially also the receiver could

1838
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,520
become aware of

1839
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,080
some issues if their sequence numbers

1840
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:42,719
and they can

1841
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,600
see that messages are dropping which

1842
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,760
would probably be an issue more on the

1843
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:51,199
uh for udp um

1844
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:53,520
because other transports are tcp based

1845
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,040
and so

1846
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,719
the if anything were to drop the the

1847
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,679
publisher would be aware of it

1848
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,000
um but then that then suggests that the

1849
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,760
receiver has some backend

1850
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,840
um ability to communicate with the

1851
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,760
orchestrator in order to send

1852
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,520
the messages they sell the modified

1853
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,800
subscription

1854
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,199
uh message down to the publisher to

1855
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,440
modify that subscription

1856
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,560
i'm just thinking about the round

1857
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,159
tripping of it i'm thinking out loud

1858
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:21,120
just making sure it makes sense

1859
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,360
is that uh what you're envisioning as

1860
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,719
well

1861
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,960
yeah i uh each configured subscription

1862
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,400
there'd have to be a way

1863
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,560
for the receiver to communicate back to

1864
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,120
the publisher

1865
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,120
yeah so so right right now for for

1866
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,560
server actually because

1867
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,320
it automatically switches the data

1868
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,400
connection rate it will you know

1869
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,080
uh send a notification actually we

1870
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,440
define the notification to

1871
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,639
to to inform the receiver about the data

1872
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:49,520
connection rate

1873
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,120
change actually this is what we

1874
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,400
we have in in the current draft if you

1875
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,719
think do you think uh additional capital

1876
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,760
that needed it

1877
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,159
not necessarily i just want to make sure

1878
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:07,839
my understanding is correct

1879
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,920
yeah your understanding is correct i

1880
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,520
i think we if

1881
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,560
there's any issue for for the mechanism

1882
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,239
with proposal

1883
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:22,880
we can definitely we can address that

1884
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,600
but

1885
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,639
right now i i didn't see a um some some

1886
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:27,040
issue

1887
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,800
on this okay

1888
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,280
i see that you have uh you're gonna make

1889
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,400
a comment can i open up the next slides

1890
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,800
um yeah you can go actually i just had

1891
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,080
one uh

1892
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,120
uh question with a chair hat on the

1893
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,080
author

1894
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,000
suggested that they were having

1895
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,120
conversations

1896
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:51,199
with um thomas on this trend

1897
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,920
um and that's great that you have that

1898
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:54,800
interaction

1899
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:57,280
um but i would recommend that the

1900
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,719
authors

1901
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:02,400
post their questions and and or whatever

1902
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:05,440
discussions they're having to the

1903
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,360
mailing list also so that other

1904
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,600
participants can pitch in and

1905
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,679
help contribute that i think it'll help

1906
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,880
you guys in the end so it'll be good to

1907
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,920
be able to

1908
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,159
have that discussion on the mailing list

1909
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:24,000
that's that's just my recommendation

1910
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,920
yeah that makes sense actually we can

1911
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,600
make a summary and send thank you that

1912
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:28,080
is

1913
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,639
we already you know discussed with uh

1914
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,800
thomas about this and uh

1915
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,159
probably some some of the uh you know

1916
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,520
uh conclusion actually we we we we can

1917
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,480
make a summary

1918
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:45,440
yeah and uh share on honest

1919
01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:59,839
thank you

1920
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,199
okay then i'd like to discuss

1921
01:25:05,199 --> 01:25:09,199
another draft with system capability for

1922
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:10,400
netcast

1923
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,839
let's slide please

1924
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:26,880
let's talk about

1925
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,199
chiffon i'm sorry i just killed your

1926
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,480
audio can you

1927
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,519
reconnect your audio

1928
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:41,840
i said national phones but uh jim on

1929
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:52,639
uh no she's coming back okay she's back

1930
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,920
sorry about that okay

1931
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,120
let's continue let's talk about the

1932
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,239
motivation and

1933
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:05,679
go as we all know rfc 6243 has defined

1934
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:06,320
the

1935
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,120
default data handling behavior and it

1936
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:09,760
includes

1937
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,480
data retrieval and create or delete

1938
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,760
operation

1939
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,080
however when talking about system

1940
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,440
configuration

1941
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,480
before mda is introduced different

1942
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,199
vendors have different solutions system

1943
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:24,239
configuration

1944
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:26,960
data can be located anywhere in the

1945
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,000
device

1946
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,480
and there is no standard behavior for

1947
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:32,560
system data handling

1948
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,440
after fba it introduced system

1949
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,400
configuration

1950
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,520
is defined in the mdi draft as a

1951
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,800
configuration

1952
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,080
that is supplied by the device itself

1953
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,880
and it should be present in operational

1954
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,320
data store

1955
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,120
but the issue is that when the client

1956
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,920
references the system configuration

1957
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,480
uh all the system configuration is in

1958
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,960
the when or master statement

1959
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,679
an error will be reported because of the

1960
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:02,239
reference

1961
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:06,560
that object does not exist so

1962
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,040
weak reference may be a choice but it

1963
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,639
has its limitation

1964
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:13,120
otherwise you have to retrieve that

1965
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:13,679
reference

1966
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:16,800
system configuration from operational

1967
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,920
and put it into running data store but

1968
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:22,800
when system configuration gets updated

1969
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,280
there is no standard mechanism to

1970
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,679
synchronize the data into running

1971
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,159
and the client cannot detect the update

1972
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:31,600
automatically

1973
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:34,639
so that's the motivation of this work

1974
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:37,760
our goal here is to resolve this issue

1975
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,840
and to define a standard system

1976
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,040
configuration that

1977
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:47,840
handling behavior next slide please

1978
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,080
so here is our solution overview we

1979
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,600
introduced a new data store named system

1980
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,480
it is read only and it does not have to

1981
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:01,199
persist across reboots

1982
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,760
at each boot time the device generates

1983
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:05,040
system configuration

1984
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,920
in system data store we also define two

1985
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,440
basic modes report all

1986
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,440
and explicit running is automatically

1987
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:14,239
synced up

1988
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:17,280
with system in the report or basic mode

1989
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,840
for example system configuration is

1990
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,320
automatically loaded into running

1991
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,719
when the device is powered on all the

1992
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:27,199
physical results is present

1993
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:30,000
on the contrary a server using explicit

1994
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,960
basic mode

1995
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,199
will not update running with system

1996
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:34,639
automatically

1997
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,840
in addition two data handling behaviors

1998
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:43,840
is defined next slide please

1999
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:49,280
so here gives the life cycle of the

2000
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,120
system configuration

2001
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,239
and a synchronization between system and

2002
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,600
running data store can be reflected here

2003
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,239
first diagram you'll stress the

2004
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:02,560
initialization during reboot

2005
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,120
when the device boots it generates

2006
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,719
system configuration

2007
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,679
in system then it loads the saved

2008
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:10,480
startup

2009
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,080
into running and at the top at the time

2010
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:14,480
of

2011
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,880
loading startup some special

2012
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,480
functionality may be

2013
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,440
enabled so conditional system

2014
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,719
configuration

2015
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,000
may be created in system lastly the

2016
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:26,639
device

2017
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,360
loads system into running in the report

2018
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,280
or basic mode

2019
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,159
and in the second diagram when you

2020
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:36,400
insert a physical resource

2021
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,520
the corresponding system configuration

2022
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:42,800
will be created in system and

2023
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,520
loaded into running data store

2024
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,800
automatically with

2025
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,920
in the report of basic mode in the last

2026
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,480
one

2027
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,199
when you remove a physical resource

2028
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:55,360
corresponding system configuration will

2029
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:56,080
be

2030
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,360
removed from system automatically

2031
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,639
and it does not affect running so next

2032
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:07,840
slide please

2033
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:13,520
here gives an interface data retrieval

2034
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:15,199
usage example

2035
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:17,679
all the configuration data snippets

2036
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:18,560
including

2037
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,440
system configuration are shown in the

2038
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:22,800
left

2039
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,159
and three types of channel response

2040
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,600
xml responses to the get operation with

2041
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,080
different

2042
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:33,199
with system parameters are shown

2043
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,159
in this example the server's basic mode

2044
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:36,960
is report

2045
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,880
of as the name of with system parameters

2046
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,080
suggests

2047
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,639
report all means reporting all the data

2048
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:45,360
nodes

2049
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,760
including data nodes and in data nodes

2050
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,360
considered to be

2051
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,639
system configuration and explicit

2052
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:56,639
means reporting the data set or modified

2053
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,159
explicitly by the client even with the

2054
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:01,040
same value

2055
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:04,320
as a server set and a

2056
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,440
trim parameter means reporting the data

2057
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,800
considered to be

2058
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,639
not consistent with the system

2059
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,239
configuration data

2060
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:17,839
set by the server so next start please

2061
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,639
okay regarding create and delete

2062
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:32,400
operation behavior

2063
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,040
in the report or basic mode the server

2064
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,440
will

2065
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,560
update running with system automatically

2066
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,679
so for a data node that is loaded from

2067
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:42,239
system

2068
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,159
automatically a valid create operation

2069
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:49,520
must fail with a data exist error tag

2070
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,000
and a valid delete operation must

2071
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,360
succeed

2072
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,320
on the other hand in the explicit basic

2073
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,120
mode

2074
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,000
ending system configuration up any

2075
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:01,440
system update

2076
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,560
will not be loaded into running

2077
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:07,679
so for a system configuration data node

2078
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,760
that is not explicitly set by the client

2079
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,080
a

2080
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,199
create operation must succeed and

2081
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:18,560
a delete operation must fail a valid

2082
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,560
delete operation attribute

2083
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,920
for a data node explicitly set by the

2084
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,040
client must succeed

2085
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:30,400
okay next slide please

2086
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,880
one of the open issues in drafting

2087
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:42,400
net contrast angles that was previously

2088
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,760
discussed on the list

2089
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:46,880
is that for some build interest anchors

2090
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:50,239
they must be firstly copied into running

2091
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,560
in order form being referenced

2092
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,040
and is the operation down automatically

2093
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,639
or explicitly

2094
01:32:56,639 --> 01:32:59,600
i think that exactly indicates the key

2095
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:00,480
values of

2096
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,679
our draft since we have avoid

2097
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:04,800
synchronizing

2098
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,400
into running manually when reference the

2099
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,159
system configuration

2100
01:33:10,159 --> 01:33:12,639
but you can still put it into running

2101
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:15,520
manually in the explicit basic mode

2102
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,480
in addition we propose a standard system

2103
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:19,600
configuration

2104
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,430
that hand only behavior so

2105
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:23,600
[Music]

2106
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,320
we would like here to collect some

2107
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,199
feedback

2108
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:30,320
is this problem worthy of discussion

2109
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:33,360
and is our proposal reasonable enough

2110
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,159
and in comments and suggestions would be

2111
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:37,760
much appreciated

2112
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,639
and of course contributions and causes

2113
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:42,080
overcome

2114
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,600
okay that's all thank you

2115
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:51,839
and in comments

2116
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:03,199
go ahead rob um

2117
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:05,760
so so i think this is an interesting

2118
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,600
idea so thank you for presenting this

2119
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,560
i think we need to be very careful that

2120
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,560
what you're proposing here doesn't break

2121
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,360
some of the axioms i should this is all

2122
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:16,639
as a contributor

2123
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,600
break some of the axioms that the nmda

2124
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,440
architecture is trying to define

2125
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:24,000
which is really trying to allow the

2126
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,840
running data store the contents of it to

2127
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,719
be controlled

2128
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,679
by the clients the operators and not be

2129
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,280
modified

2130
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,960
by the device so that was the aim of

2131
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:34,320
that architecture

2132
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,800
and sort of quality to that is the

2133
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,760
desire to allow that configuration to be

2134
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,800
validated off the device if possible so

2135
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,719
the aim there is to have all of the

2136
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:46,159
configuration that you need

2137
01:34:46,159 --> 01:34:48,320
to get the the system running uh

2138
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,679
available in one go

2139
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:51,679
but i do acknowledge that in some cases

2140
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:53,280
you have the system created

2141
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,960
configuration coming to the system

2142
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,280
it's in operation you don't see this so

2143
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,560
i think the idea of of having a system

2144
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,880
data store is interesting it's worth

2145
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,000
exploring

2146
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,400
and having that feed into operational

2147
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,000
makes sense to me

2148
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,040
um i that the ability of it updating

2149
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,560
running automatically seems

2150
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,159
dubious to me i'm not sure that's a good

2151
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:18,800
idea and i didn't really understand

2152
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,719
how that ties in with the two different

2153
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:22,159
basic modes if that was your with

2154
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:23,920
defaults handling or not

2155
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,960
i think that that is probably not the

2156
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,719
right approach

2157
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,280
but you could have manual rpcs in my

2158
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:32,480
mind that copied

2159
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,440
configuration from system into running

2160
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,440
that's driven by an operator to do that

2161
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:38,800
and say okay i want you to move this

2162
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:39,920
over this time

2163
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,760
but i think we need to be very careful

2164
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,600
not to change

2165
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,320
um the fundamental axioms of how the

2166
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,159
nmda architecture is working otherwise i

2167
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:52,080
think it will devalue that architecture

2168
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:55,760
okay thank you for the comment i think

2169
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,199
we our intent here is trying to maximize

2170
01:35:59,199 --> 01:35:59,840
the

2171
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,960
convenience of the client because the

2172
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,560
client retrieves the system

2173
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,880
configuration from operational

2174
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,440
and then put it into running into

2175
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,639
running manually

2176
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,440
the operation is could be complicated

2177
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,119
with low efficiency

2178
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:18,239
and when the system configuration got

2179
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,360
updated

2180
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,440
the client cannot detect it

2181
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,960
automatically

2182
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,480
but the same updates should be reflected

2183
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,600
into rounding

2184
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,239
so we think that it's unreasonable that

2185
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:30,960
the

2186
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,440
system generates a configuration

2187
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,280
automatically but the client needs to

2188
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,600
reconfigure it

2189
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,800
regarding the two two basic modes

2190
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,600
the report or basic mode will update

2191
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,880
running with the system configuration

2192
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,199
in the system data store automatically

2193
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:50,480
that

2194
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,520
resolve our issue but we still reserve

2195
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:54,000
the

2196
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,920
explicit basic mode is to be compatible

2197
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,719
with the

2198
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:01,920
existing mechanism um because i think

2199
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,679
for some implementations

2200
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,719
they maybe cannot afford to change a

2201
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:07,199
large

2202
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:10,320
logical code so that they can support

2203
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,519
explicitly only

2204
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:21,840
i let the large comments

2205
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:34,480
go ahead blush

2206
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:37,199
do you hear me

2207
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,960
yes we hear you okay so three comments

2208
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,320
one is that we already have a

2209
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,280
rfc uh about a factory default

2210
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,320
configuration

2211
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,440
which seems to

2212
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,360
somehow that that should be included at

2213
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:57,360
least in initialization

2214
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:02,159
uh use case the other comment is that

2215
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:05,679
i don't find this uh

2216
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:10,000
mick are using the report or an explicit

2217
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,320
mode and these terminology from

2218
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:16,320
with defaults intuitive in this case

2219
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,280
i think that that was all really for

2220
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,520
more for reporting something than

2221
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:25,040
than for actually configuring anything i

2222
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:25,840
would probably

2223
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,520
use a different terminology

2224
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:32,239
and the third is that although it's not

2225
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:33,199
popular

2226
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:36,080
in our circles but other standard

2227
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,199
organizations for example 3gpp

2228
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:43,760
do use systems that automatically

2229
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,000
configure parts of the running

2230
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,480
configuration

2231
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,719
it has its problems definitely but they

2232
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:53,040
do use that

2233
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:58,960
thank you

2234
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,960
okay hi uh this is ching actually to

2235
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,440
answer the question raised by the uh

2236
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,040
robert williams actually he suggested

2237
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,800
maybe use ibc but

2238
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,280
uh you know for kalani initiated this

2239
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,400
rpc how

2240
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,000
the client detects the system

2241
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,679
configuration changes so this is the

2242
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:17,280
challenges so that's why

2243
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,280
we haven't think about how to use this

2244
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,040
rpg to address this issue

2245
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:27,840
yeah thank you

2246
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,080
just to reply on on the rpc a client

2247
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,800
could see that the system configurations

2248
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,880
changed if it was a data store

2249
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:42,080
if it was registered for a notification

2250
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,679
of changes to that data store so it

2251
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,040
could use a standard subscription for

2252
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:48,159
that if necessary

2253
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:55,839
okay yeah i got it thank you

2254
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:10,320
go ahead time if that's the case then

2255
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,719
you know what what does what is the

2256
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,639
value of system i mean

2257
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,800
because you can do the same thing on

2258
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,639
operational right

2259
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,639
and you get changes off of operational

2260
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:22,800
and particular items that you want to

2261
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,800
potentially modify into running

2262
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:30,000
so i'm kind of missing what system would

2263
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,480
provide

2264
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:38,400
uh in the report or basic mode you

2265
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:41,440
you don't have to retrieve the

2266
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,480
data from operational and then you

2267
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,559
write them into running manually

2268
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,840
yes but i was saying that if you were if

2269
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,360
you were

2270
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,480
took the approach that you weren't doing

2271
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,719
a writable

2272
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,480
a writable running type of approach you

2273
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,159
were doing you know the

2274
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,719
approach that you're um similar to the

2275
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,800
approach that you're doing now

2276
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:09,840
and and but you were um the the other

2277
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,840
method was to say

2278
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,840
if i use rpcs and i use subscriptions

2279
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,040
why wouldn't i just use the

2280
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,960
subscriptions on operational

2281
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,880
right and then the client would use the

2282
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,040
rpcs to write into running

2283
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:25,520
you wouldn't need a system data store

2284
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:26,639
that's what

2285
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:28,560
that's what i was just trying to figure

2286
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,840
out if that was true

2287
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:40,560
just to reply to tim i think one

2288
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:44,000
difference would be that the system data

2289
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:44,880
would show you

2290
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:47,520
purely the system configuration whereas

2291
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,320
what is in operational it is possible

2292
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,119
that some of those system values might

2293
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:55,040
be overwritten with

2294
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,679
explicit configuration or other values

2295
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,920
that come elsewhere so

2296
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:01,760
what use operation wouldn't necessarily

2297
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,760
have all that system configuration

2298
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:05,920
an example would be an interface that's

2299
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:07,679
created automatically because it exists

2300
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,480
a physical interface on the device

2301
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,560
that would live in system but if you

2302
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:14,000
were using that interface you'd have

2303
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,560
explicit configuration as well uh to

2304
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:17,440
configure the properties of that

2305
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,639
interface so what you'd see in

2306
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:19,760
operational

2307
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,320
would be labeled as um configuration

2308
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,080
coming from intended rather than

2309
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,239
system so there would be a difference

2310
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,000
between what you would get

2311
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,080
whether that would actually matter i

2312
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,239
don't know as it may be that that is not

2313
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:33,440
important given that

2314
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:36,159
you've already configured those uh those

2315
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:37,520
properties it may be the fact that you

2316
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,040
don't see them in operational

2317
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,560
doesn't matter so but in operational

2318
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,320
don't we already have something that

2319
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,400
talks about the origin or the source of

2320
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,960
the the information

2321
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:50,880
absolutely but i think it only returns a

2322
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,880
single value

2323
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,679
and i can't remember if it tells if it

2324
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,280
gives a precedence to the different

2325
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,600
orderings but i'd always imagine that if

2326
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,400
you had

2327
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,719
an interface that comes from both

2328
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,320
explicit configuration

2329
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,960
and system that what you report is the

2330
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,360
explicit configuration it seems to be

2331
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:13,280
of higher importance whereas

2332
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,440
i i get it wrong i'm just a plus we're

2333
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,320
getting a plus

2334
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:21,040
proliferation of data stores right it

2335
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:22,560
just

2336
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,880
just seems to me that when we when we

2337
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,119
add data stores things get

2338
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:30,320
more complex a lot more complex quickly

2339
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,199
maybe sorry i think there is no

2340
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:35,920
precedence in the operational

2341
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,719
that implementation issue which is the

2342
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:39,440
precedence

2343
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:42,560
operation just shows whichever has won

2344
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,080
in the origin parameter

2345
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,920
right right so you still have the

2346
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,040
problem of

2347
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,560
you know what is what does the two

2348
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,639
values mean right you know one one and

2349
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,639
running the other and operational

2350
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,320
and how did it get into operational

2351
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,840
right

2352
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:10,880
kent has a contributor um responding to

2353
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:11,679
tim

2354
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,920
i think that same issue is uh was in

2355
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,280
discussed slash envisioned in the nmda

2356
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,560
work with dynamic data stores

2357
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,679
um at least you know there we defined we

2358
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:27,360
said that if

2359
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,000
if the configure value you know came

2360
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,679
from the dynamic data store then

2361
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,600
i think the origin value would specify

2362
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,280
that but it didn't

2363
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,320
ever you know if there was a

2364
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,040
multiplicity of dynamic data stores

2365
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,600
um while the collection of them were

2366
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,560
envisioned to be

2367
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,040
processed after uh intended

2368
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,600
how they would be processed um amongst

2369
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:50,880
each you know the ordering

2370
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,520
amongst themselves was never defined and

2371
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,639
sort of left

2372
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,280
um as future work and it seems to me

2373
01:44:57,280 --> 01:44:58,400
that this system

2374
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,480
data store would have to be viewed in

2375
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,839
that way as well

2376
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:18,959
any other comments

2377
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,159
so the on the last as chair as on the

2378
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:29,600
last three

2379
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,560
presentations there's been a request to

2380
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,280
discuss

2381
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:37,119
the adopting of the drafts

2382
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:40,239
and i think that they require more

2383
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,840
discussion on the list

2384
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:45,760
but the chairs will discuss that

2385
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,719
and propose to the authors a course of

2386
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:51,040
action

2387
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,960
and with that i will sorry jen did you

2388
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,360
want to say something

2389
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:00,400
yeah uh we will actually you know uh

2390
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:03,040
address the issue raised on the list

2391
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:03,760
actually

2392
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:06,400
for two to draft and we collaborate a

2393
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,080
little bit on the list and you can meet

2394
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:11,199
with it yeah yeah it would be best if we

2395
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:12,960
could have a discussion on the list for

2396
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,000
each of these drafts

2397
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,679
and sort of uh break have that

2398
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:17,840
discussion um

2399
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,080
come to a head before we initiate any

2400
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:20,960
sort of adoption

2401
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,280
thank you okay and that'll start to

2402
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,080
bring up the slides

2403
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:27,840
the last presentation just a second

2404
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,920
so while kent is trying to bring up the

2405
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:37,119
slides

2406
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:39,920
so we wanted to take the remaining time

2407
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,320
we

2408
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,800
had initially anticipated this finishing

2409
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:43,760
a little earlier

2410
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,040
the rest of the presentation but anyway

2411
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:50,320
uh with the remaining 15 minutes

2412
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,159
um the topic really is about

2413
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:57,600
um what we want to do next with

2414
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,800
rescant and x resconf

2415
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:08,400
so um next slide please

2416
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,520
so this is a question is open forum feel

2417
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,280
free to jump on the queue

2418
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,760
and if you want to suggest something

2419
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:20,000
i don't have an ordered uh sequence of

2420
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,679
things that i want to go through

2421
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:24,000
but there are some fundamental questions

2422
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,080
that we probably want to try to get an

2423
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:29,040
answer to first is

2424
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:32,080
does the workgroup feel that

2425
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:34,840
the protocols have been mature have been

2426
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,000
implemented

2427
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,679
and maybe needs uh either minor tweaking

2428
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:42,800
or maybe a major revision

2429
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:46,560
and if so um is it

2430
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,639
do you want to target both net comp and

2431
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:50,080
rescum protocols

2432
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:55,360
for revision and as

2433
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,760
maybe the question of deciding whether

2434
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:00,080
it is a minor tweak to the protocol or

2435
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:00,800
major

2436
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,800
would be decided based on the issues

2437
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,719
that we decide to address

2438
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:07,280
so that obviously brings up the question

2439
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:09,040
of what issues

2440
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:11,360
that we do want to address if we do want

2441
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,639
to wrap the protocols

2442
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:18,239
there is a list of issues uh

2443
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:24,320
maybe next slide we can just flash it

2444
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,679
um so all these issues by the way

2445
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:30,800
are on github um so

2446
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,600
anyone can go in there either add to an

2447
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:34,639
existing

2448
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:38,560
issue or add a new one if they feel

2449
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,840
the existing that doesn't address their

2450
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,119
issue

2451
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:46,639
and similarly there is a rescant

2452
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:51,040
next set of issues on the last slide

2453
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:54,239
um so back to the

2454
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:57,280
question to the working group

2455
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:00,639
um oh there's a corrected url i guess

2456
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:04,719
uh it's not um

2457
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:08,560
next is netconf anyway

2458
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,920
so um the question back to the working

2459
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,840
group and i

2460
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,840
is do does the working group feel that

2461
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,280
these protocols are ripe for a revision

2462
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:24,960
and i'll pause this to see if anyone has

2463
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,840
any comments

2464
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:42,560
hi match as a contributor and also as

2465
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,000
presenter i'm just going to

2466
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,599
move to the next slide so people can at

2467
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:47,440
least see that slide while we're having

2468
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,719
this conversation

2469
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:51,119
um there are some rest conf next issues

2470
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:52,000
as well

2471
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,480
um but so as a contributor

2472
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:58,560
i'm aware of the fact that netmod

2473
01:49:58,560 --> 01:49:59,679
working group

2474
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:02,800
also has a yang next um

2475
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,800
tracker and um with a desire i think

2476
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:08,159
there's over a hundred issues that are

2477
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:09,360
being tracked there over

2478
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,360
you know for the past three or four

2479
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,400
years now

2480
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,599
um it's probably getting ready for some

2481
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,840
work to be initiated

2482
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,880
um and uh you know so

2483
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,360
to what extent if you know with these

2484
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,320
protocols

2485
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:27,599
should they any update to them

2486
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:30,800
to be deferred until um that

2487
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,040
effort and that mod has resolved or at

2488
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,800
least has kicked off so we

2489
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:36,320
there's more visibility into what it

2490
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:39,679
looks like

2491
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:44,239
yes i mean there would be i guess

2492
01:50:44,239 --> 01:50:47,520
some follower from um whatever yang next

2493
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,199
decides to address

2494
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:52,719
when they decide to address yang next um

2495
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:55,199
i think that is at least one item maybe

2496
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:56,800
in the rest count

2497
01:50:56,800 --> 01:50:59,760
not in the restaurant in the next next

2498
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,360
set of issues

2499
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,760
that has to do with um i think if you

2500
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,840
bring up that slide

2501
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:12,480
has to do with uh cleanup of the

2502
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:13,760
specification

2503
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:17,599
relative to yang xml

2504
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:20,639
so we do allude to what we do know

2505
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,679
um as it takes us in um

2506
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:26,480
the young rfc uh but we don't know of

2507
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:30,239
course what will yank next might bring

2508
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:34,560
um

2509
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,840
but i think there is a lot a

2510
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:40,480
larger issue which probably has to do

2511
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:40,880
with

2512
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,080
quick uh as a transport so and

2513
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:47,199
rob wanted to particularly highlight

2514
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:49,360
that so i'll let him speak to

2515
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:51,840
the question of what impact quick might

2516
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,760
have on both the protocols

2517
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,280
rob yes i was hoping um

2518
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:59,199
to hear more input from other

2519
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,639
participants in the working group i'll

2520
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:00,960
just

2521
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:02,800
let you know my thoughts as a

2522
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:04,159
participant so

2523
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:06,639
uh first of all quick that's pretty much

2524
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:07,199
it's through

2525
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:10,400
the isg now um and it's

2526
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:11,599
i think it's probably on its way to the

2527
01:52:11,599 --> 01:52:13,199
rfc editor that it's quite got through

2528
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:14,239
there yet

2529
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:17,599
um but but quick is uh the new version

2530
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,239
of tcp in essence along with tls

2531
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:22,239
and it does have some features that may

2532
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:23,360
be of interest

2533
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,760
to us for net confidence particularly to

2534
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:26,960
do with

2535
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,400
um telemetry the fact that it allows

2536
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,119
um sessions to be set up more easily and

2537
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:34,480
it allows

2538
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:37,199
separate streams to be carried uh within

2539
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:39,199
the same protocol session so

2540
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:40,800
i think it's certainly worth thinking

2541
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,040
about quick whether that is useful for

2542
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,000
netconf

2543
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,280
and correspondingly http 3 which is the

2544
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:48,159
same as

2545
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:52,320
http 2 but over quick for resconf

2546
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:55,440
um in my mind the question is to whether

2547
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:57,520
we should concentrate on one protocol

2548
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,880
or the other i think that they both have

2549
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:04,159
different goals that they are serving um

2550
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:05,920
and hence i think it makes sense to try

2551
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:08,000
and work on both of them over time

2552
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,440
i don't know whether this is the right

2553
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,360
time or not but i do think

2554
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,440
that it's potentially worth looking at

2555
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:15,199
to see if it's now time to

2556
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:18,159
to to consider revolt um evolving these

2557
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:20,719
protocols

2558
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:24,639
but i came for feedback from others if

2559
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,840
possible

2560
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:41,839
quite dinner

2561
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,119
so we not able to hear you

2562
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:50,400
okay this is better now yes okay very

2563
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:50,960
good

2564
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,840
thanks so there are plenty of features

2565
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:55,119
right and i see them

2566
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:58,000
on the two links that you shared right

2567
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
uh i see jaylen encoding support and

2568
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:00,719
netcam

2569
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:02,159
great there are plenty of things you

2570
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:03,520
could be doing but what would be

2571
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:05,520
interesting is to understand

2572
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:08,000
what are if all these features are

2573
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:08,800
coming from

2574
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,840
real operators right and if that be the

2575
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,560
case

2576
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,239
then it means that we know what we work

2577
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,320
on because these are paint point in

2578
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,159
developing or new features that they

2579
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,480
want

2580
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,679
this is what i would be interested to

2581
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:23,360
understand i know it's a tough task

2582
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,360
right but uh

2583
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:29,840
operators feedback first no agree

2584
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:31,760
and if there are any operators in this

2585
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,520
meeting right now i would love to get

2586
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,840
their input

2587
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:50,159
right as a contributor this counts um i

2588
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:51,440
was thinking the same thing

2589
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,239
like if i i mean at least as i'm aware i

2590
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:54,719
don't

2591
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:57,440
know any pain points that are being

2592
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,960
expressed by operators

2593
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,000
um exactly you know i mean

2594
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,440
we have a certain number of drafts that

2595
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,080
we've um are in flight

2596
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:08,159
right some that are um chartered and

2597
01:55:08,159 --> 01:55:10,639
some that are not yet chartered

2598
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:13,199
for instance the list pagination work uh

2599
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:15,040
something that's been discussed and it's

2600
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,280
been highlighted as a pain point of

2601
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:18,560
sorts

2602
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:20,639
but for that draft and and others that

2603
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,480
are in in progress

2604
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:26,880
they are in uh updating existing netconf

2605
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,000
rocs as opposed to um

2606
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,280
replacing them uh with business

2607
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,599
and uh so i would hope that maybe you

2608
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:36,320
know we could

2609
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,800
continue doing that um you know and i

2610
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,880
don't know if that's possible with quick

2611
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,560
uh if that would necessitate a biz

2612
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,840
of the rfcs or if it's possible to do um

2613
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,440
as an update but

2614
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,400
i guess the the point i'm making is if

2615
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,599
there were you know

2616
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,000
very specific pain points as benoit

2617
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,360
points out we could

2618
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,760
possibly address them as updates to

2619
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:03,440
existing rfcs as opposed to creating new

2620
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:05,919
rc's

2621
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:13,520
that's great okay just respond to your

2622
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,760
question kent on quick i certainly there

2623
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:16,639
is a

2624
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:19,199
a draft in the quick working group for

2625
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:19,920
doing

2626
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,800
netconf over quick but i presume that

2627
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,599
that is

2628
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:26,159
merely doing exactly what it does today

2629
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:27,599
but with just quickest underlying

2630
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:28,159
transport

2631
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:30,960
as in i'm not sure you potentially are

2632
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:31,840
making

2633
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:35,280
it would allow netconf or telemetry to

2634
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:36,159
be making use

2635
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:37,920
of the new capabilities of quick or it's

2636
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,679
just a standard this use this is the

2637
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:40,960
transport

2638
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:43,679
so um so that what you're proposing is

2639
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:44,320
these

2640
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,159
point updates maybe that's possible i

2641
01:56:46,159 --> 01:56:48,320
don't know it's worth investigating

2642
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,560
i do wonder whether there's when it gets

2643
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,480
to a large enough set of them

2644
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,320
um whether you need to do something

2645
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,480
that's a bigger change and again the

2646
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:58,159
other one i think on there is things

2647
01:56:58,159 --> 01:57:01,040
like the binary encoding i think that

2648
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:02,320
mahesh had a go at

2649
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,440
doing that but it looked like it was

2650
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,360
getting a bit tricky i guess to do that

2651
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:05,679
as an

2652
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:08,159
update um so i don't know if it will

2653
01:57:08,159 --> 01:57:10,000
just stop some of this work happening

2654
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,080
i completely agree with benoit that

2655
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,000
getting feedback from the operators

2656
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,760
as to what they need is important

2657
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:24,560
as well

2658
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,719
and one um i see time in the queue but

2659
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:28,239
quickly responding to rob

2660
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:29,840
uh one thing that occurs to me is that

2661
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:31,280
you know if you're going over quick

2662
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,760
that might necessitate um allocating a

2663
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:35,440
new port

2664
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:38,159
currently um you know rescon servers and

2665
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:39,280
netcom servers have

2666
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:42,000
dedicated ports so perhaps a different

2667
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,960
port would need to be used

2668
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:53,839
go ahead time

2669
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:59,040
and did you have a comment

2670
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:03,760
i was speaking to mute so for a couple

2671
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:04,639
other standing

2672
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:06,080
standards bodies that we're currently

2673
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:08,080
working with and having discussions with

2674
01:58:08,080 --> 01:58:09,599
operators as well

2675
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:13,199
on on certain features we constantly

2676
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:17,040
or we come up against

2677
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:20,320
questions about the utilization

2678
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:23,599
of yang with um uh with grpc

2679
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:26,000
and and gpb right in fact i had some

2680
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,840
discussions earlier this morning with an

2681
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,040
operator

2682
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,679
on on a topic uh or a couple of

2683
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:32,320
operators

2684
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,679
on a topic with that right um so

2685
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:37,520
i i don't know if that fits into a rest

2686
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:38,800
comp type of

2687
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,280
transport binding and encoding or if

2688
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:42,800
that's its own

2689
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,239
you know you got rest conf net conf and

2690
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:49,440
something else conf right

2691
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,599
grpc conf or something like that i don't

2692
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,920
know but it's a it's interesting that

2693
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:55,360
you know particularly as we get into

2694
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,840
telemetry or we get into control plane

2695
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:01,840
um relay and we want to utilize

2696
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:05,360
yang as a as a way of conveying

2697
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:08,159
um you know that the semantics of the of

2698
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:09,040
the

2699
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:11,119
the data model effectively the data

2700
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:13,040
model it's uh

2701
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:16,159
grpc and and gpb as a way of encoding it

2702
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:19,679
is uh becoming more and more uh

2703
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:22,480
acceptable right and so i'm not quite

2704
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:24,639
sure what that means in terms of netcomp

2705
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:26,560
and rest comp if that's just a binding

2706
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:31,599
or if that's a new protocol

2707
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:35,040
okay so

2708
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,440
um and since we're coming up to the end

2709
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:38,800
of the meeting let me just quickly

2710
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:39,520
summarize

2711
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:41,760
what i understand of the comments that

2712
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:43,280
we have received till now

2713
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:47,280
um i absolutely agree with benway

2714
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:50,080
as far as trying to get more operator

2715
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:51,280
input

2716
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:54,960
in trying to decide what are the

2717
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,199
issues that we want to try to address

2718
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:59,599
and maybe that will of course decide

2719
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:02,560
um whether we have both the protocols or

2720
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,239
just one of them

2721
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:06,080
and what are the features we try to

2722
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:08,159
address as part of that

2723
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:11,520
um but i think rob's point about the

2724
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,000
fact

2725
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,719
that the quick protocol itself might

2726
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:16,480
associate

2727
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:19,520
um a rev for

2728
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,920
both the protocols is an important

2729
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:23,760
consideration to have

2730
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,960
um it's not something we might um

2731
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,040
we can decide to ignore for some period

2732
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:31,199
of time but i think if adoptions go

2733
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:32,159
ahead as they

2734
02:00:32,159 --> 02:00:35,440
are for quick um then we

2735
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:39,199
might come back and have to look at

2736
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,599
saying what it takes to um what changes

2737
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:42,400
would be needed

2738
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:45,840
for risk on the next uh netcon

2739
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,440
but so that's my observation of

2740
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,800
based on the comments that i've seen

2741
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,560
till now so we can continue the

2742
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:54,990
discussion on the mailing list

2743
02:00:54,990 --> 02:00:56,239
[Music]

2744
02:00:56,239 --> 02:00:59,119
and understand anyone has anything else

2745
02:00:59,119 --> 02:01:01,839
they want to add

2746
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:09,840
okay um so

2747
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,920
we are at the end of the hour and the

2748
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,480
end of the meeting uh thank you everyone

2749
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,960

2750
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:17,599

2751
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:20,719
once uh when kent and i have had a

2752
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:23,440
chance to go with them
