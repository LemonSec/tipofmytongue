1
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,640
be clear

2
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,479
i mean i'm just a participant that don't

3
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,840
have the share right so

4
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,520
anything all right well we can start now

5
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,000
i guess

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
it's it's one after the hour uh welcome

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,240
everyone to tsv area

8
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,920
at 110 i hope you're all having a good

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,759
remote meeting

10
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,159
um approaching the end here i think

11
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,680
this is the notewell um i think

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,520
probably most of you if not all of you

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,040
have seen this if you have any

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
uh if you need to read this detail

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,400
please type this into your

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,079
itf note well into your favorite search

17
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,680
engine and you can

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,439
review it in detail click the links and

19
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,400
find out everything you want to know

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,880
about

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,560
notewell uh this is the agenda for today

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,360
um

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
i would like to bash my own agenda and

24
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,799
actually just move the open mic

25
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,840
in front of ed's dtn talk

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
um just because i think it'll be shorter

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,880
and i just want to give

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,360
dtn the time it needs to to uh

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,759
take us where the discussion wants to go

30
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,479
um so

31
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,000
after the normals of this trivia and the

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,600
open mic we're going to have uh

33
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,680
edward barron of the i hope i pronounced

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,878
that correctly

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,639
of the dtn working group he's the new

36
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,000
chair there and he's going to

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
um repeating the the experience of our

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
presentation last time we're going to

39
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,920
highlight another less known part of the

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,640
area and

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,120
and talk about dtn which is pretty cool

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
it's got lots of deep space stuff which

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
i think is cool

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,239
um and it's also a lot of interesting

45
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,160
and challenging technical problems so uh

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,519
looking forward to that talk would

47
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,840
anyone else like to bash the agenda

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
okay our most significant change

49
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,280
i think is that um as of yesterday

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,959
uh in a somewhat bittersweet uh moment

51
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,720
we're not saying goodbye to magnus by

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,560
any means he's not going anywhere

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
but he will no longer be one of the area

54
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
directors

55
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,360
um magnus has uh

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
done a total of six years of the job

57
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
again in 2006 and just concluded a

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
two-year term

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
um it has been incredibly valuable to me

60
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
to have someone with that depth of

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,120
experience

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
both as an ad and is in the transport

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
area in the itf in general

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,480
because i i uh uh i'm not necessarily

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,000
strong in that particular area and just

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,519
having his advice and his

67
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
his his uh his wisdom on a number of

68
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
matters has been invaluable to me so

69
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,879
uh and you know i think he's done a lot

70
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
of things for a lot of people in this

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,680
in this area um his most notable

72
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
achievement probably i think he would

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720
say his most notable achievement in this

74
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,760
term was getting quick

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
out the door just under the wire um

76
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,799
which is of course an enormously

77
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,720
consequential uh

78
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
development not just for transport area

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,080
but for the internet

80
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,120
um and of course he's

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,959
and of course zahad is moving into that

82
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,159
position he's taking

83
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,879
all of the working groups that magnus

84
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,280
had

85
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,159
except we are switching tram and rmcat

86
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,519
for reasons that aren't worth

87
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,760
explaining and probably have any impact

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
on anything frankly because those

89
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,959
groups appear to be winding down um so

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:13,599
magnus

91
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,680
any word you would like to share with us

92
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,600
thank you very much for those words uh

93
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,040
yeah it's been

94
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
two fairly interesting years been

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,199
intense with quick but i i also would

96
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,320
like to really

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
i think if large accomplished has been

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
to actually get the dtn

99
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,120
core specs out that in some sense has

100
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,440
taken more work from me as an aed

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,440
and then a lot of four near issues with

102
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,800
cross-area relations

103
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,360
because dtn as you will see is actually

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
not

105
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
just the transfer protocol it's the

106
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
whole idf

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,320
squished into one working group in some

108
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,800
sense for that particular problem

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
so it's it's a lot of challenging

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,160
problems and

111
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,360
security routing etc all

112
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,880
exist in there but you will learn more

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,639
about that later but

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,400
so therefore actually is happy that we

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,479
managed to get the first set of specs

116
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,280
yes standards standard strikeout and

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,720
that the working group can continue to

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,759
work

119
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,160
there's been a number of other specs but

120
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,800
actually

121
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,039
looking back this two-year term has been

122
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,280
from a document perspective valley light

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,639
and and we haven't

124
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
which maybe got more through in some

125
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,039
sense but um

126
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
yeah still idf changes and that's been

127
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,120
noticeable also

128
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,120
compared to my 2016-2010 term

129
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,000
this it's another isd it's another itf

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,919
logically you maybe not notice this when

131
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,280
you're just looking here but when you

132
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
take this

133
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
managerial roll up and you see a little

134
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,800
bit more and you actually see what has

135
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
changed etc so

136
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,039
i i enjoy it but i'm gonna enjoy being

137
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,000
back uh

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
going back to doing maybe a little more

139
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
technical work

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,400
and uh also the

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
tsb art is not gonna get rid of me

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
because i'm backwards reviewing and i'm

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
gonna

144
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,240
probably work a little bit more

145
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
intensely to sign them documents when

146
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
to help out wes in the triage position

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
so

148
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
and i hope every one of you will be

149
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,479
happy with yeah that's in

150
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,120
as a replacement i will i think we are

151
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,639
colleagues and work fairly close i will

152
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,680
be able to assist him quite a lot

153
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
so

154
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
yeah done thanks magnus for your work

155
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,960
and your friendship um uh would you like

156
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,758
to introduce yourself

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,840
yes i would i uh so so thanks magnus

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,039
um and uh martin duke for um

159
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,759
having me here uh i need to be here and

160
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,280

161
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,800
uh so my name is but usually people call

162
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,440
me

163
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
a short version of that jahid so you can

164
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,120
call me jahid

165
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,080
um so i work at ericsson uh particularly

166
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
ericsson research especially with magnus

167
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
as colleague for last 13 years

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
so we have been doing a lot of work

169
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,720
internally in edition resource

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,759
together and then

171
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,360
i live in stockholm sweden

172
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,639
so that's it um my entry in

173
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,639
ietf is from 2008 uh after then

174
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
i have been working on different working

175
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,080
i think it was pc and working group

176
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,880
that's where

177
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,240
i first posted my draft um

178
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,759
and then i worked in a video call um

179
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
webrtc um and more like quick and

180
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,360
i have chair tabs taps arm cut

181
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,400
substantial work done in the arm cut uh

182
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
so uh internally also i have been

183
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,919
working on different layers like

184
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
application layer transport layer

185
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
and radial layer so i have some

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
experience on the mobile networks

187
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,319
obviously everywhere for example uh so

188
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
that's that's it uh that's who am i as

189
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
some of you

190
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
might already know me uh and i'm looking

191
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,080
forward i think i'm already getting

192
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,720
uh so two thing i did when i get assured

193
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,199
from

194
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,440
magnus he's not abandoning me and the

195
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
other thing is like i'm taking off some

196
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,319
of the stack

197
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
that he has left so nice work done uh

198
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
great achievements uh magnus hopefully

199
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,680
um i'll leave up to this expectation

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,559
welcome zahad i'm looking forward to uh

201
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,120
to

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,399
spend the next couple of years with you

203
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
this will be this will be fun

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,000
moving on uh here is a update of

205
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
um uh

206
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
of the working groups from across the

207
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,120
area

208
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,040
i don't know if there's anything that

209
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,640
that my colleagues here would like to

210
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
to highlight in particular but i'll just

211
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,080
give you a moment to look through that

212
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,360
i will say that alto dtn are uh rapidly

213
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,640
approaching a recharter

214
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,440
uh as is quick for that matter and so if

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
you're interested in the overall

216
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,920
direction of those groups this is a good

217
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,120
time to get involved in those

218
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,279
um

219
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,920
and uh i just also note the 793 bis

220
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,720
which is

221
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
about as foundational as they come in

222
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,480
terms of transparent area documents is

223
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,120
is um

224
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,440
it's in working group last call so uh

225
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,360
obviously not a giant change the way tcp

226
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,560
works but something that

227
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
most of us hold doing near and dear to

228
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
our hearts

229
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,080
so magnus did we ship anything of

230
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
consequence this is since 109

231
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,279
i can't remember like i think it's i

232
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,360
mean it wasn't really much

233
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,279
happening no

234
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
only only only nine specifications

235
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
and the fact that we actually i mean the

236
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
first four of the quick documents i do

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
expect to within weeks as i said

238
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,839
yesterday in the plenary too it's

239
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,360
it's nothing preventing it's just the

240
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
editing time from the rfc editor here

241
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,880
and then the other 48 and

242
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,079
there's so there's no known uh

243
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
issues before it's published the quick

244
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,200
http

245
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,880
and coupon specs they're gonna be stuck

246
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,959
behind the miss ref in hbbs

247
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,680
but i expect it to come out within a few

248
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,320
months

249
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
uh they are making progress and we're

250
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,560
already working plus call a few

251
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,519
back so it's making progress yes so not

252
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,440
only quick and dtn which uh we've

253
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
already spoken about the significance of

254
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
that but also

255
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,720
cluster 238 the the for the pile of

256
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
rmcat documents that was stuck forever

257
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,560
actually made it to rfc so

258
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
the queue is much smaller than it used

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
to be just a few things that are blocked

260
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
because of some some down references

261
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,399
um mainly from ippm so uh

262
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,000
good work everybody it's a very

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
productive um

264
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,640
interim between the two between it 409

265
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,440
and today

266
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
so nice work yeah and i expect there's a

267
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
few more of those documents that was

268
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,480
from 309 is

269
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
it's actually gonna start moving aren't

270
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,399
they uh they're some of the ippm

271
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,760
documents

272
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,440
still and they i hope they nfs

273
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,279
it's not too far off either but it's

274
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,959
and they're not and there are three or

275
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,480
four that are through itf last call

276
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
they're just kind of dealing with some

277
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,959
some isg issues and whatnot so so we're

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,640
you know we're really turning the crank

279
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,839
pretty well here as an area

280
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,279
this is our um every meeting reminder

281
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,399
that we have a tsv

282
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,600
area review team um which

283
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
greatly assists the iesg in reading

284
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
documents from other areas

285
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
and looking at them in transport lens

286
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
and making sure they're not doing

287
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,519
stupid stuff from transport perspective

288
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,000
uh i invite you to contact

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,040
magnus or wes i think magnus is

290
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,720
not listed here but i think as of today

291
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,240
he's back on the tsv art or as of

292
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,360
yesterday

293
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
um so you can you can contact west or

294
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,760
magnus if you're interested in

295
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,920
participating i think it's a good

296
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
opportunity to

297
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
learn a little bit what's going on

298
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,240
elsewhere in the itf outside transport

299
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,279
area and also

300
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
helps us a lot helps create good quality

301
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,320
documents

302
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,680
and i think as you can see that little

303
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
number parentheses is how many reviews

304
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
they had to do since 109. so

305
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,279
uh you know people read one or two

306
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
documents or in some cases zero

307
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,519
documents

308
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,720
and uh i i would hope that shows that's

309
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,560
not an incredibly onerous workload on

310
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,279
people so

311
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,040
so please uh you know if this something

312
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,639
interests you please contact either west

313
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,760
or magnus

314
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,839
and thanks to our reviewers for the good

315
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
work that they've been doing

316
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,230
yeah okay so that's um

317
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,880
[Music]

318
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
i stopped sharing ah okay so that

319
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,000
concludes

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
the advanced trivia and i think we'll go

321
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
ahead and open it up for open mic

322
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,440
if anyone has any concerns issues

323
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,000
questions about things in the area of

324
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
any three of us

325
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,720
this would be the time to get in the

326
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,959
queue

327
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,519
okay there's a very content population

328
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,560
out there either that or

329
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,519
asleep um where most of us should be

330
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,560
right now

331
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,160
uh okay so um i think

332
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,360
at this point we'll go ahead and head

333
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,279
off to uh edward moran who is the dtn

334
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,320
working group chair

335
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,120
the newish one and he is going to talk

336
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,600
about

337
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:03,839
this particular part of the area

338
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,079
all right

339
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
so give me a moment as i figure out how

340
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,480
to share my screen

341
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,839
uh let's see

342
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
there's a there's a share button in your

343
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,560
in the upper left

344
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
there's a there's a monitor with a line

345
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,360
through it that's how you share your

346
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,399
screen

347
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
so i clicked uh share screen request and

348
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,279
i think i'm cued

349
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,760
waiting uh to be given permission oh yes

350
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,360
okay yeah the ui is a little backwards

351
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
from my intuition okay there we go now

352
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,959
you're set

353
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,160
right and uh are you seeing my screen

354
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,760
oh i'm saying my screen so

355
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,440
okay hi my name is ed bahrain i'm from

356
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,760
the

357
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
johns hopkins university applied physics

358
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,240
laboratory i'm a co-chair of the dtn

359
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,959
working group

360
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,680
along with uh rick taylor from airbus

361
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,800
defense in space

362
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
uh i wanted to spend a little bit of

363
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,480
time today and talk about

364
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,560
uh just sort of the general area of

365
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
delay tolerant networking and then some

366
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,440
of the things that we're doing

367
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,040
in the working group and i i see

368
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,800
a couple of familiar uh names uh in the

369
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,639
in the meeting and some people who had

370
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,560
been working on dtn in the past as well

371
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,719
so

372
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,320
yes can you go to full screen in your

373
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
presentation

374
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
oh sorry if it works i think it's going

375
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,600
to be easy for

376
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,720
especially with your coming figures oh

377
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,839
indeed

378
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,399
thank you very much no worries so so

379
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,000
what i wanted to do is give just sort of

380
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,199
an overview of

381
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,519
the history of dtn how we got here how

382
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
we came to understand the problems

383
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
how it came into ietf and then in

384
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,320
particular as magnus said before

385
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,519
d10 is a large uh and sort of uh

386
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,720
cross area um set of concerns but i

387
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,320
wanted to then focus a little bit

388
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
on how the bundle protocol in particular

389
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
the bundle protocol version seven

390
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
operates it really is the the transport

391
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
protocol for dtn and the thing that has

392
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,880
mo you know a lot of the attention with

393
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
the addition of how to secure that

394
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,120
protocol

395
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,279
and then uh lastly i i have there are

396
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,199
many case studies on the the value of

397
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
dtn in certain environments

398
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,160
and i picked uh one related to nasa

399
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,839
optical communications so if we talk a

400
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,920
little bit about a brief history

401
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,079
the we have some urls in the top right

402
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,480
here if you go to nasa.gov

403
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,399
they have a couple of pages associated

404
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,639
with why nasa cares about this

405
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,800
but as we sometimes like to say with dtn

406
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,040
it came from outer space

407
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,480
there was an initial desire to move

408
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,680
uh from this very point to point uh

409
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,079
link uh scenario which is what we have

410
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,000
for the most part now uh

411
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,160
in deep space where individual space

412
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,440
agencies

413
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
build uh their entire direct-to-earth

414
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,079
infrastructure when they land

415
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,720
on mars when they start landing on the

416
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,360
moon

417
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,279
uh when they start putting orbiters and

418
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,679
other deep space assets into space

419
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,039
and how do we get to a point where we

420
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,959
get to some sort of you know deeply

421
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,079
richly uh networked model uh of

422
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,839
of spacecraft could we get to a point

423
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,199
where landers are

424
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,480
only carrying enough radio to get

425
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,439
up to an orbiter and can rely on a

426
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,319
network

427
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,799
to give them that multi-hop back in

428
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,720
particular with the non-linearities of

429
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,760
transmission

430
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
adding those hops where you can get to a

431
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,720
more resource node actually can increase

432
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,679
the data rates

433
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,760
while reducing size weight and power on

434
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,600
landers and so there's there's really a

435
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,960
significant

436
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,000
desire to get to that point so when

437
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
when space agencies in general and nasa

438
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,760
in particular started looking through

439
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,039
this they said well there are a couple

440
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,520
of

441
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,679
do's and do nots that we think we need

442
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,559
here

443
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,280
certainly there were a few do nots which

444
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,840
are

445
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,760
we can't always assume that a path an

446
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
end-to-end path exists all at once

447
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,600
uh if you're a lander and the orbiter

448
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,360
isn't uh overhead then

449
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,919
you can't talk to it if the orbiter is

450
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:04,640
overhead

451
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
but you don't have line of sight back to

452
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,559
earth you can't talk to ground

453
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,679
uh you therefore also given long uh

454
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,000
light uh round-trip delays and just

455
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,679
generally the resource-constrained

456
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,679
nature of some of these devices

457
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,520
you you also don't always have the

458
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,720
ability to keep

459
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,600
end states uh at the lander down to

460
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
ground station and so on

461
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,360
and certainly because of those first two

462
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,039
things if you do have to do

463
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,160
re-transmissions

464
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
you don't want to re-transmit from the

465
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
original message source

466
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
because it's hard enough to get through

467
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,440
the network and starting all over again

468
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
from scratch

469
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
makes that more difficult you you do

470
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,799
want to store data sometimes clearly for

471
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,760
milliseconds

472
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,000
sometimes for days depending on when you

473
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
get passes and when you can get

474
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,559
dishes on earth to point to things and

475
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
because you might not have

476
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,480
end state information at endpoints

477
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,240
session information at endpoints

478
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,919
you may want to increase the amount of

479
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,360
annotative metadata

480
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,840
that you take with you in your messages

481
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,600
either encoded in payloads

482
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
but from the networking layer also

483
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
included as extra

484
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,679
secondary headers in the message itself

485
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,360
and then came the question of well if we

486
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
do that from a transport perspective

487
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
then how do we secure things now

488
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
obviously we know we can't rely solely

489
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
on physical layer security

490
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,520
but if you are in in this sort of top

491
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,400
picture

492
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,240
of point-to-point links without really a

493
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
networking model there tends to be an

494
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,039
over-reliance on that kind of security

495
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,679
if we have annotative metadata added as

496
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,799
secondary headers

497
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,960
in a packet in a bundles as we'll come

498
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,880
to see does that change how we

499
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,679
secure things and then how do we make

500
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,440
sure that while we're storing things for

501
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,880
milliseconds or days

502
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
that they are secured and then there are

503
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
other questions about how much autonomy

504
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,160
goes into network management and

505
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
how do we do routing with time variant

506
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
graphs and so on

507
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,080
and when we started asking those kinds

508
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,600
of questions then the

509
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,679
the the first thing you do is you say

510
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,360
well what what do we currently have and

511
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,960
what can we currently reuse

512
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
we certainly don't want to make a new

513
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,559
thing uh just because

514
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,120
and and there were sort of two driving

515
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,679
uh

516
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,080
concerns uh that came out of you know

517
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
everything we just talked about

518
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,919
the first was delay and the second was

519
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,880
disruption

520
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
and and the delay case is you know

521
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,880
fairly clear you know if

522
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,240
if we look at this particular

523
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,240
illustration where we have you know some

524
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,320
number of nodes nodes one two three and

525
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,720
four

526
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,559
on the vertical with some notion of time

527
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,919
on the horizontal

528
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,440
and if if blue uh here or the shaded

529
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,320
area

530
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,159
represents connectivity between the

531
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,559
nodes if you have a data volume

532
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,200
which we call d1 and it has to wait for

533
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,240
an end to end

534
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,440
node 1 to node 4 path to

535
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
exist all at once it may be waiting for

536
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,840
a very long time and it may be waiting

537
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,000
for long enough that by the time that

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
transmit opportunity comes

539
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,280
there's another data volume which would

540
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,799
be in contention uh

541
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
with that that same end-to-end path and

542
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
if of course we can

543
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,840
take advantage of sooner uh hops uh

544
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
than waiting for an end-to-end path then

545
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
the ability to

546
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,760
exfiltrate data off of a particular

547
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
platform sooner

548
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
uh you know for certainly for resource

549
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
constrained devices allows you to

550
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,120
get data off your platform so that you

551
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
can free up storage and take new

552
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,000
observations

553
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
but it also means these kinds of link

554
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,159
opportunities don't become wasted

555
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,080
in the network the other observation

556
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
uh was disruptions and and what happens

557
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,240
when we have

558
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,559
frequent enough disruptions that the

559
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,760
disruptions are

560
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
not uh considered uh strange cases to

561
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,919
recover from

562
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,320
but they actually uh represent the

563
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,600
normal operation

564
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,240
of the the network as you have it so if

565
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,760
we look at a standard

566
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,320
you know you know session establishment

567
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,039
uh con

568
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
up where we take some amount of time to

569
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
synchronize on information

570
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,799
we do data exchange and keep sessions

571
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,960
alive we do some cleanup at the end

572
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,240
you know if there's negligible

573
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
disruption it's all handled as part of

574
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,640
just the minor jitter in the network

575
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,960
uh if you get infrequent disruptions of

576
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,840
significant

577
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,080
length uh this this graphic isn't meant

578
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,440
to imply that packets are

579
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,320
actually exploding but if we sort of

580
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,720
lose

581
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,960
uh and time out we may have to

582
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
re-establish sessions or if the session

583
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,240
itself collapses we may have to

584
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,679
re-establish sessions

585
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,799
and there's an implied focus here on

586
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,520
if we can just wait out the storm then

587
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,000
we can go back to normal operations

588
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,320
of course if the disruptions are regular

589
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,280
enough uh

590
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,799
and infrequent and perhaps even

591
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,760
unplanned then it becomes a lot harder

592
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,880
to do that and so the the overall area

593
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,480
of dtn uh started uh as delay tolerant

594
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
networking it sort of morphed into

595
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,159
disruption tolerant networking

596
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,200
and it again was this

597
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,480
um migration from you know what would a

598
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
solar system internet or an

599
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
interplanetary internet

600
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,120
look like uh 30 50 years into the future

601
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,720
and what can we do now just to get

602
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,400
little bits of it

603
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,360
that concept doesn't look dramatically

604
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,640
different than

605
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
local sensor networks so instead of an

606
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,200
orbiter over a lander on a planetary

607
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,240
surface

608
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
you may have a data mule maybe a uav or

609
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,440
or

610
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,080
a car or a bus going by and collecting

611
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,240
sensor nodes and maybe you have

612
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,799
a satellite a satcom backhaul or maybe

613
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,919
something else

614
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,039
and so if the problems on the left are

615
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,120
mostly delay the problems on the right

616
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,080
might actually

617
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,440
be more disruption so

618
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,000
then if we said that was some of the

619
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,440
statement of problem

620
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,400
uh what could we start doing uh to solve

621
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,279
all of this so

622
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,559
so dtn uh started looking at

623
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,440
a couple of things related to you know

624
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,360
existing protocols can we

625
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,720
pick up and reuse uh ip about 15

626
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,240
i think at this point 15 years ago

627
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,000
there's a lot of discussion of

628
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,039
whether a nasa should be baselining ip

629
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,919
for their for their deep space uh

630
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,760
networking aspirations

631
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,200
uh they started looking at the kind of

632
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,799
things that are just sort of generally

633
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,840
considered useful

634
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,919
uh on the internet today a couple of

635
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,360
them are here i'm sure that the

636
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
people in the audience know and can come

637
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,480
up with many more

638
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,159
suggestions than the couple of bullets

639
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,080
here but the idea of of

640
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,279
caching and pushing information uh

641
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,760
and and not you know relying on sessions

642
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,799
if you don't have to

643
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,360
or not having to rely on nested sessions

644
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,880
and things of that nature

645
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,640
but a lot of this it came down to the

646
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
observation again

647
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
that we don't have infinite access to

648
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,520
bandwidth and and

649
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,320
as silly as that sounds if you are if

650
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,799
you are

651
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,200
wholly in control of the construction of

652
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
your purpose-built

653
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,799
network then there is a sense that you

654
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,880
can build it and resource it enough

655
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,120
for the data that's coming through uh

656
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,720
whether whether that actually tends to

657
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
be true over the entire lifetime of the

658
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640
network and whether that remains true as

659
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,600
you try and federate

660
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,520
other networks you know that that tends

661
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,279
to be the we need to think 10

662
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,679
15 years into the future so so being

663
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,720
able to go to

664
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,120
uh missions and be able to go to those

665
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,200
who build their own networks and say

666
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,720
you cannot just assume that you will

667
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,880
solve these problems by having you know

668
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,000
relatively infinite

669
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,640
access to bandwidth even when you do in

670
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,760
the moment you're going to have to

671
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,039
prioritize

672
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,880
you're going to want to look at whether

673
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
or not your protocols are making good

674
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,520
use of these

675
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
of of your bandwidth when you federate

676
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,279
you're going to need to worry about

677
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,480
untrusted infrastructure so dtn

678
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,960
came back as specific solutions to some

679
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,000
of the problems and

680
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
and if you look to the right here again

681
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,039
you see another

682
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:40,960
concept of of how folks would measure

683
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,600
what they would call the the latency of

684
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,880
of

685
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,679
of an ip network where latency here

686
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,360
includes the wait for the end to end

687
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,000
path

688
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
versus uh what folks would call the d10

689
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,120
latency

690
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,039
which is the time essentially to get

691
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,480
data off the platform

692
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,320
then when we started looking at not just

693
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,919
waiting for the end to end path but

694
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,440
the asymmetry of of the likely

695
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,000
links where you may have a very very

696
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,559
small

697
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,640
uh for example very small uplinks but

698
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
very large downlinks

699
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,919
again going back to the space cases

700
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,120
where an orbiter

701
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,000
may have a much larger dish uh more

702
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,640
power

703
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,960
and be able to send data down uh to a

704
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,320
lander or back to earth

705
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,840
significantly faster than the lander

706
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,320
could otherwise you know upload it

707
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,080
there are again a couple of features

708
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,679
that you need you need to be able to

709
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,600
send data without knowing if the end

710
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
state destination is online or not you

711
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,720
don't want to start

712
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
re-transmissions back from the beginning

713
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,440
partially because of the

714
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,520
disconnected nature of these networks

715
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,039
and partially because of the

716
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,600
significant asymmetries of of the

717
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,400
uplinks

718
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,159
if you uplink something and it gets

719
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,320
somewhere that's great you don't want to

720
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,600
then take that precious

721
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,000
uh low rate up link and use it for the

722
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,520
re-transmissions if you can

723
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,360
avoid it and again we talked a little

724
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,520
bit about the this concept of bundling

725
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,640
annotated data with your payloads

726
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,360
if you do that then your endpoints

727
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,039
perhaps don't need to

728
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
remember very much uh session

729
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,640
information or special states

730
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,960
and all of all of this sort of boils

731
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
down into what you know started to look

732
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,799
like familiar features in other areas

733
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,120
like asynchronous text messaging

734
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,799
or email and the interesting

735
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,799
observation from the dtm perspective is

736
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,000
how do we get that

737
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,799
down into a package that is small and

738
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,679
efficient

739
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,360
enough that it can run on very resource

740
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,000
constrained devices

741
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
so what then came out of that was a

742
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,559
description of of dtn as a

743
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,760
suite of protocols and applications

744
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,880
and this is uh what is considered uh

745
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,360
right now to be sort of the core set of

746
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,399
concerns

747
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,640
that that are being addressed now the

748
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,600
the four

749
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,320
major uh uh protocols that are on the

750
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:58,720
right

751
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,679
are uh uh just so happen to be the four

752
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,440
documents uh three of which

753
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,799
uh have have gone out uh for um centers

754
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,480
i think are waiting on a

755
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,559
a ref a missing reference and then a

756
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,480
third related to security

757
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,799
and and these are uh the bundle protocol

758
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,880
uh bp version 7

759
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,120
and that is the main transport protocol

760
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
that is the the protocol that allows for

761
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,760
these

762
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,600
extension headers for carrying

763
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,440
additional information and the behavior

764
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,760
around store and forward operations

765
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,640
a security protocol for securing uh the

766
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,919
bundle in particular

767
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,559
the ability to handle uh and secure

768
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,440
payloads uh

769
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,200
separately from some of these secondary

770
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,480
headers uh

771
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,360
a some context security context to

772
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,480
provide

773
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,720
information around how that security

774
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,080
information and the cryptographic

775
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,320
materials they're in should be handled

776
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,720
and then uh because bp is is is

777
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,440
considered an

778
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,799
overlay uh how it it maps to uh the

779
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,559
underlays that are carrying it and in

780
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,320
particular

781
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,679
out of the working group the first

782
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,679
convergence layer is a tcp

783
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
convergence layer certainly not to imply

784
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,240
that in the space cases we're using tcp

785
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,600
for communication

786
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,559
but there are plenty of terrestrial uses

787
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,679
of dtn

788
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,000
that care about disruption but otherwise

789
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,520
don't have long signal propagation

790
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,159
delays

791
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
but then there are other things that are

792
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,279
that are weighting and

793
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,000
progressing and and those include work

794
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,279
one quality of service

795
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,240
uh time variant uh graph routing in

796
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,399
particular the ccsds

797
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,600
is working through something called

798
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,320
schedule aware bundle routing

799
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,039
and there is additional work on what it

800
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,960
means to do key management in

801
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,720
these kinds of very disconnected

802
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,080
networks and

803
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,440
a look at network management uh

804
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
from a from to include more uh

805
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
deterministic autonomy

806
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,799
uh in the system which is the

807
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,399
asynchronous management protocol

808
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,399
or amp uh things that are not

809
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,720
particularly considered part of the

810
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,880
ecosystem are higher level user

811
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,159
applications

812
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,000
delay tolerant file transfer or

813
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,640
messaging or or that sort of thing

814
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
and then the underlying transport

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
mechanisms beyond how we talk about them

816
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
in the convergence layers

817
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,279
are also things that aren't considered

818
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,480
part of that suite

819
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,360
so we we start we've talked quite a bit

820
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,919
about

821
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:17,279
the nasa and the space part of the

822
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,520
problem dtn has

823
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,919
the the focus on d10 included many

824
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,240
different folks over time

825
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,080
my my understanding of the history is it

826
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
started uh with nasa's

827
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,039
concerns about interplanetary networking

828
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,320
uh darpa

829
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,640
picked it up for several years and and

830
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,399
worried about what it means in highly

831
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,840
disrupted environments

832
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,640
the ccsds the consultative committee for

833
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,240
space data systems

834
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,159
uh looked at and started doing some

835
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,320
initial standardizations uh specific to

836
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,039
space

837
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,120
and then it came into the irtf and the

838
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,640
ietf

839
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,080
a dtn research group was formed in 2002

840
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,640
uh that was chaired by kevin fall and

841
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,760
yorgoth

842
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,960
and its initial charter uh pulled from

843
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,320
the initial charter which you can see

844
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,200
from i

845
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,559
rtf4 concluded dtnrg was the observation

846
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,840
that you know non-interactive

847
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,159
asynchronous messaging was important and

848
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,919
not only is it important in these space

849
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,640
cases

850
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,399
but there are lots of different networks

851
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,320
where this would be useful

852
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,399
the irtf the dtnrg produced 14 rfcs

853
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,960
uh four that were notable they were all

854
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,480
notable before that were fundamental

855
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,519
were a dtn architecture rfc 4838

856
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,320
the bundle protocol version six an

857
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,720
initial security protocol and an initial

858
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,720
tcp convergence layer in 2014

859
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,799
after after some experimental

860
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,720
deployments and field tests and lessons

861
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,320
learned

862
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,039
a working group was formed to

863
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,919
standardize this and that was at ietf 91

864
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,640
and the initial charter uh large parts

865
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,640
of the initial charter were to take

866
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,919
this work from the uh from the irtf and

867
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,440
the lessons learned from field

868
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,360
deployments and then

869
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,240
update these different documents and so

870
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,399
you know update rfc 5050 which was

871
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,080
bundle protocol version 6

872
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,799
update 6257 the security protocol you

873
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
know provide a convergence layer

874
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,279
rfc update to tcp and that's what we've

875
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,880
done and that's why they mentioned we're

876
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,679
going into

877
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,799
our rechartering uh discussions now

878
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,399
uh so the the ones that are in the

879
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,720
editor's queue uh bundle protocol seven

880
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,200
security and tcpcl version four

881
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,039
and then another that's an ad evaluation

882
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,519
which is a security context to work with

883
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,880
the security protocol

884
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,519
so if we speak just a little bit about

885
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,200
the bundle protocol

886
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,640
and you know the first question always

887
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,559
is where does it live and sometimes the

888
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,080
answer is wherever you would like it to

889
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,120
live

890
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,960
and if you were to go out and pull

891
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,640
images off the internet as i did to

892
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,919
create this slide

893
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,840
you'll see a couple of different

894
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,399
versions of this but generally a bundle

895
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,039
uh bundle agent or forwarder is

896
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,200
something that that lives in an overlay

897
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
overlaying uh and speaking through its

898
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,559
convergence layers

899
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,519
the value of that of course is that a a

900
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,640
bp

901
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,039
instance can go over different uh

902
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,000
underlying

903
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,240
networks and so just like for internet

904
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,760
transfers and what hopefully is a very

905
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,720
familiar

906
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,840
um simplification of of

907
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,480
uh tcp networking where you don't need

908
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,720
to of course you know terminate tcp at

909
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,679
every node

910
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,880
uh and tcp talks end to end if we put a

911
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,200
bundle layer in place the bundle layer

912
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,039
has the ability to do some storage

913
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,120
because it is a stored forward network

914
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,600
but also it can sit over various

915
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,919
convergence layers to include the point

916
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,200
where perhaps you you move away from tcp

917
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,159
and then do something else for you know

918
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,480
a to bridge a tcp part of the network

919
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,600
with a non-tcp

920
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,480
part of the network

921
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,480
the bundle itself is considered a bundle

922
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,360
of blocks

923
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,080
uh so everything is termed a block uh

924
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,760
there is a primary block which of course

925
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,600
is a primary header there is a payload

926
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,480
block which is

927
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,640
a payload and then there are a series of

928
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
extension blocks and you can have

929
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,919
sort of any number of those uh

930
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,239
the the primary block has standard uh

931
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:10,960
primary

932
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
header things in it it identifies the

933
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,440
bundle and particular processing options

934
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,760
it says as routing information here that

935
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,520
just means that it has a sort of source

936
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,599
and destination

937
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,520
information in it as well as something

938
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
called report to address

939
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,560
to send administrative or other statuses

940
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,079
as as you work your way through the

941
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,159
network these optional

942
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,000
blocks extension blocks you can have

943
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,199
zero of them you can have

944
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,679
more and they are what carries

945
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,520
additional annotative data

946
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,560
either annotated data for the payload or

947
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
annotated data for the network like what

948
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,000
was your previous hop

949
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,760
and then the payload of course is is the

950
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,000
payload and payloads can be

951
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,918
full payloads or payloads can be marked

952
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,839
as fragments of some prior payload

953
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,000
if we look at the extension block

954
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,119
mechanism uh

955
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,920
in in bp one of the things that's

956
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,359
interesting about it of course is that

957
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,160
you can define

958
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,800
uh and and the protocol is structured to

959
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,599
allow

960
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,440
for the creation of of new extension

961
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,119
blocks uh over time

962
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,200
and also for nodes that are doing

963
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,359
processing to read these extension

964
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,079
blocks

965
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,480
do whatever processing is necessary and

966
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,280
maybe even

967
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
uh write back or update those extension

968
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,560
blocks or

969
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,599
add new ones so it is not necessarily

970
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:26,480
the case

971
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,599
that the originator of a bundle is the

972
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,240
only

973
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,560
bundle agent that would add an extension

974
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,480
block obviously i just mentioned before

975
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,599
something called the

976
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,320
prior hop block that's something that's

977
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,000
added by a prior hop so

978
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,960
you could accept a bundle in uh look at

979
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,000
the prior hop block

980
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,960
that is there remove it add your own and

981
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,160
send it along the way

982
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,400
and and again this is part of getting to

983
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,320
that operational concept

984
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,200
of not relying on state existing end to

985
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:55,760
end

986
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,000
but being able to update it uh in the

987
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,200
network as you go

988
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
and and that's essentially uh what we

989
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,560
talk about uh here

990
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,599
the value of course is that if if you're

991
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,280
able to synchronize state

992
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
end-to-end uh and end-to-end could mean

993
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,640
truly message and and

994
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,800
or maybe uh source to some initial

995
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,720
gateway or something else

996
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,400
then you know you you can make your

997
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
messages smaller and just simply refer

998
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,680
to sessions

999
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,320
uh as you um or session state that's

1000
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,599
that's synchronized

1001
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,240
along the way uh if you can't rely on

1002
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:28,640
this

1003
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
then you need to carry all of that

1004
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,000
information with you and i

1005
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,160
i think that that is probably one of

1006
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,599
sort of the key insights

1007
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,599
behind bundle protocol the need to store

1008
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,440
the data waiting for

1009
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,640
a time variant path and this idea that

1010
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,079
you can't always rely

1011
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,240
on your endpoints to tell you what you

1012
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,000
need and you can't always rely on your

1013
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,960
destination

1014
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,480
to know everything it needs to know to

1015
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,119
process you

1016
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,280
uh from that perspective again we talked

1017
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,960
about primary blocks and payload blocks

1018
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,359
what's interesting in bpv7 uh

1019
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,920
is that the the primary block is is

1020
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,560
immutable

1021
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,920
so it can be uh signed by the uh

1022
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,119
by the bundle source and and it should

1023
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,599
remain

1024
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,599
unchanged through the network uh unless

1025
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,040
it is fragmented in which case

1026
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,359
new new bundle fragments are created but

1027
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,880
that's not the original bundle that's a

1028
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,839
fragment

1029
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,920
uh and then you know the payload block

1030
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,440
it's always the the last block in a

1031
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,240
bundle uh

1032
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,640
the original bp version 6 had some ideas

1033
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,960
of extension blocks before a payload and

1034
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,720
extension blocks after a payload

1035
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,440
to help with the the the understanding

1036
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,119
of very large bundles

1037
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,880
but we didn't see the need to carry that

1038
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,960
forward in bp version 7.

1039
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,200
and then the extension blocks in general

1040
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
which are the ones that live between the

1041
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,880
primary block and the payload block

1042
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
have some standard information in them

1043
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,320
what is the type what is the unique

1044
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,920
identifier of the block if

1045
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,680
if you have more than one block of the

1046
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,680
same type existing in a bundle

1047
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,920
and then are there interesting

1048
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,400
processing options associated

1049
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,280
with those blocks so for example because

1050
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
extension block types can be added to

1051
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,040
over time you may you may find that

1052
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,359
not every bundle agent in a network

1053
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,480
understands

1054
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,240
every block type and so there are

1055
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,960
options here that say things like

1056
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,800
if you understand this block type

1057
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
process it but if you don't understand

1058
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
this block type

1059
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,240
just pass it along quietly or if you

1060
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,920
don't understand the block type

1061
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,000
then that's a problem and remove that

1062
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,839
block from the bundle before you pass it

1063
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,320
along

1064
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,400
or if you don't understand the block

1065
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,920
type that's a big problem

1066
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,000
and get rid of the entire bundle and and

1067
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,079
process it no further or perhaps

1068
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,920
hold it off to the side for forensic

1069
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,839
analysis

1070
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,200
within the bpv7 spec itself uh we

1071
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,920
uh define a couple of blocks that are

1072
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,040
are useful

1073
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,560
that we think are generally useful and

1074
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,160
need to be supported

1075
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,800
the three of them here are the the again

1076
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,119
the previous hop block the the previous

1077
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,000
node block

1078
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,480
which is the information associated with

1079
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,640
the last transmitter of the bundle

1080
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,880
a bundle age block which carries the

1081
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,640
sort of accumulating milliseconds from

1082
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,400
the time the bundle was created

1083
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,480
until it was last forwarded this is

1084
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,400
particularly helpful for devices that

1085
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,119
themselves have can keep relative time

1086
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,880
but have difficulty keeping absolute

1087
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,760
time

1088
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,720
and then a for for areas where you know

1089
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,079
hop count is still a

1090
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,640
a very useful thing even in a delay

1091
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,000
tolerant network for

1092
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,839
for to avoid routing loops and things

1093
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,520
like that particularly in time variant

1094
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,320
graphs

1095
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,720
uh carrying hop counts and and hop

1096
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,599
limits uh

1097
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,760
may also be you know necessary in the

1098
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,040
network and then

1099
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,800
uh there's a another set of

1100
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,960
specifications uh called the bp

1101
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,720
sec or the bundle protocol security

1102
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,280
protocol uh which uses two additional

1103
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,000
blocks

1104
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,160
to carry integrity and confidentiality

1105
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
information and i'll talk about those a

1106
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,160
little more

1107
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,119
in just a moment uh which is right now

1108
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,160
because it's a little more about

1109
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,359
security

1110
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,640
so when we then asked ourselves if we

1111
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,960
don't necessarily you know have session

1112
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,720
end-to-end session information and we

1113
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,480
have this additional metadata

1114
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
what do we do there were a couple of

1115
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,560
design decisions associated with

1116
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,040
a security protocol specific to bundle

1117
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,160
protocol

1118
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,560
the first was if we're having different

1119
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,480
kinds of information in a bundle

1120
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,800
then having block level granularity uh

1121
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,720
is going to become important because now

1122
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,319
information that normally would be in

1123
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,359
different payloads

1124
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,040
is now in a single bundle and we may

1125
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,560
have to treat that differently

1126
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,359
perhaps we want to sign an extension

1127
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,599
block with metadata or sign the primary

1128
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,079
block

1129
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,240
but encrypt a payload and those are two

1130
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,520
different things that may have to

1131
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,240
coexist

1132
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,280
in a single pdu uh separately if we

1133
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,000
accept

1134
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,920
that different nodes in a network could

1135
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,240
add extension blocks as we go like with

1136
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,359
the prior

1137
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,640
pop extension block well

1138
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,760
then the node that adds a block may

1139
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,599
have to secure that block and that's

1140
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,359
different than the node that created the

1141
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,079
bundle itself

1142
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,760
so there are different sources of

1143
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,560
security uh in a pdu

1144
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,079
and then of course because of those

1145
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,839
first two things you will have different

1146
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,280
security policies

1147
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
uh if if you have different security

1148
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,720
sources in the network they will

1149
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,800
probably have different identifications

1150
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,240
they might be using different cipher

1151
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,920
suites or if they're using the same

1152
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,800
cipher suite

1153
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,079
they will probably have different keys

1154
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,920
or other cryptographic material

1155
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,240
associated with those cipher suites to

1156
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,359
that end

1157
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,720
different cipher suites and sets of

1158
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
cryptographic materials are active in

1159
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,079
the system

1160
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,480
and if you take all of those four things

1161
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,319
and you then need to come back and say

1162
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,319
there must exist

1163
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,119
some some spec some limitations and

1164
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,400
constraints on this

1165
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,880
so that we can deterministically process

1166
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,760
all of this

1167
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,000
and not wonder about who did what in

1168
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,160
what order in ways that we can't back it

1169
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,640
out

1170
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,240
and back it out in a forensically

1171
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,118
recreatable way

1172
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
uh so to that end uh the the security

1173
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,880
protocol

1174
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,280
uses the extension mechanisms in bp for

1175
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,800
the security of information

1176
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,480
in bp uh and uh to that end we define

1177
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,800
two uh extension blocks related to

1178
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,599
security

1179
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,839
a block integrity block for integrity

1180
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
services and a block confidentiality

1181
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,240
block

1182
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,800
for confidentiality services block

1183
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,400
integrity is defined here

1184
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,119
as essentially an integrity mechanism

1185
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,720
over plain text

1186
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,520
is for if for example you're using uh

1187
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,319
signing

1188
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,480
as your integrity mechanism then you can

1189
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,839
sign plain text and you can sign

1190
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,280
multiple blocks at once

1191
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,599
and it can carry that along and there

1192
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,680
there are some constraints associated

1193
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,920
uh with not having circular references

1194
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,359
if you if you use

1195
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,400
bibs and bcb's uh for your security and

1196
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,880
bibs

1197
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,119
can target bcbs which can target bibs

1198
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,640
which can target bcbs

1199
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,400
that's something you want to avoid so we

1200
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,760
had to put some some

1201
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,520
some constraints there and then a

1202
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,280
confidentiality block

1203
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,920
is defined as confidentiality on the

1204
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,880
plain text

1205
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,440
and integrity over the cipher text what

1206
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,560
that means is

1207
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,160
any cipher suite used for the

1208
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,079
application of confidentiality

1209
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,440
it really must be an aad cipher suite it

1210
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,480
needs to

1211
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,920
carry with it you know you know

1212
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
additional authentication data

1213
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,720
uh and and it uh to to include being

1214
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,960
able to do things like cryptographically

1215
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,520
bind blocks into a bundle so that for

1216
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,359
example you could include the primary

1217
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,560
block

1218
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,359
of the bundle as part of the

1219
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,880
authenticated data

1220
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,200
along with the ciphertext that's created

1221
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,118
when you create for example a signature

1222
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,359
if if we then sort of look through the

1223
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,200
the security considerations

1224
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,800
unique to dtn's there are certainly a

1225
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,040
lot of them obviously with any kind of

1226
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,640
store and forward network there's a lot

1227
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,839
of concern about

1228
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,960
a person in the middle attacks

1229
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,800
clearly eavesdropping and working on

1230
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,640
things uh out of band

1231
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,520
and offline uh the the concern of course

1232
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,280
when you have blocks that are added and

1233
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,640
removed from a bundle

1234
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,800
uh you worry about modification and

1235
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,640
replay and then anything that's time

1236
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,359
variant

1237
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,040
uh there are concerns about you know

1238
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,560
topology attacks

1239
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,640
as well so uh for those who are

1240
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,920
interested in this uh

1241
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,520
there is a a a good uh security analysis

1242
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,560
of this in the bp

1243
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,560
sec document itself under security

1244
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,680
considerations

1245
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,480
where we talk through uh what we can

1246
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,359
handle in

1247
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,680
inside of the bundle itself and then

1248
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,359
what can't be handled from a security

1249
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,119
perspective solely inside of the bundle

1250
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,839
and would need to be taken more out of

1251
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:18,480
band

1252
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,240
in the network but not in a particular

1253
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,640
bundle itself

1254
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,560
uh the last thing i wanted to mention on

1255
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,000
the security side

1256
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,640
is you know when would you use uh the

1257
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,359
bpsac

1258
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,520
protocol you know so it is not something

1259
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,280
that needs to be used all the time and

1260
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,480
it depends of course

1261
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,960
on the security you're trying to to

1262
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,680
create

1263
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,400
so if you want security at rest then

1264
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,240
having the security as part of the

1265
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,160
protocol data unit itself certainly

1266
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,680
helps with that

1267
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,760
it is nice to say that you know some of

1268
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,359
the blocks inside of a bundle are

1269
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,119
themselves encrypted by the network and

1270
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,319
if the network's going to store this

1271
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,640
persistently for hours and days

1272
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
then that security persists and you

1273
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,319
don't have to decrypt

1274
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,359
a bundle coming out of a secure

1275
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:04,079
um you know tunnel and then re-encrypt

1276
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:04,400
it

1277
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,040
for for storing it uh locally and then

1278
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,880
decrypt it off of the local

1279
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,839
uh drive uh and then uh re-encrypt it

1280
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,760
for pushing it down the next tunnel so

1281
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,319
you can save some of that um if you need

1282
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,880
that kind of security at rest

1283
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,040
interestingly obviously we think that

1284
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,040
applications will provide

1285
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,520
encrypted payloads when the applications

1286
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,200
feel that that is necessary

1287
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,480
but then all of the additional

1288
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,079
extension blocks and other network

1289
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,520
information itself will need to be

1290
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,319
encrypted

1291
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,760
and then of course the underlying

1292
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,599
convergence layers we also assume

1293
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:38,319
provide

1294
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,240
security but since the convergence

1295
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,400
layers may change as the bundle works

1296
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,760
its way through the network

1297
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,800
then um you know then again having

1298
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,480
security within the bundle itself is a

1299
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,160
useful thing uh

1300
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,720
the other interesting uh observation is

1301
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,319
that there are probably some

1302
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,640
some different ways of using this that

1303
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,440
may be interesting to certain

1304
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,319
security operational concepts namely if

1305
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:03,359
you're trying to create

1306
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,400
secure tunnels in in networks but

1307
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,599
they may want to overlap if you use

1308
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,839
security solely as encapsulating the

1309
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:12,800
entirety

1310
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,000
of a bundle in ways that don't uh

1311
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
don't secure extension blocks and

1312
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,760
payloads separately

1313
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,520
then it's all or nothing for things that

1314
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,319
are in a tunnel however if you wanted

1315
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,440
because you're carrying different

1316
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,440
information to have for example

1317
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,680
uh integrity over a primary block from

1318
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,359
the beginning to an end of a

1319
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:34,760
of a transmission end to end uh perhaps

1320
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,920
confidentiality

1321
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,800
uh for some subset uh some other kind of

1322
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,480
confidentiality for another subset of

1323
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,200
the network

1324
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,079
this becomes impossible to do if if

1325
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,839
everything is treated the same within

1326
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:46,880
the pdu

1327
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,480
however if you look at this block by

1328
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,560
block and not pdu by pdu

1329
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
you can start getting that kind of

1330
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,880
behavior

1331
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,400
then the last thing is just you know

1332
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,160
there are many many uh

1333
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,119
studies on uh how story and forward in

1334
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,680
general

1335
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,400
and bundle protocol in particular uh is

1336
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,960
useful

1337
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,960
in you know challenged environments and

1338
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,560
how we get data through

1339
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,839
uh here's here's a one from 2014

1340
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,839
uh called the lunar laser communication

1341
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:14,880
demonstration

1342
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,400
that nasa had had run and it was uh just

1343
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:18,880
to

1344
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,200
to show uh the value of optical

1345
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,240
communication and

1346
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,720
and how how we are proceeding at that

1347
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,240
time

1348
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,839
while many of us probably understand the

1349
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,359
value of that you know the

1350
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,240
certainly the driving value here is eirp

1351
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,440
that you know a nasa

1352
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,640
34 meter antenna using 20 kilowatts of

1353
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,359
power

1354
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,960
can get about 8.3 um

1355
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,920
eirp a lunar laser com terminal which is

1356
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,359
about 10 centimeters

1357
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,440
using about a half a watt of power can

1358
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,920
get the same eirp and that's just

1359
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,440
really motivating uh so there was a dtn

1360
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,520
demo uh that was done uh

1361
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,720
in in this way uh it was using um

1362
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,160
dtn up to and through uh so bent piping

1363
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,920
through the lunar link i don't think

1364
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,599
that detain was actually

1365
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
on the spacecraft itself but it was

1366
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,400
it was um providing the actual date of

1367
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,680
handling when that link

1368
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,680
went up and down and one of the things

1369
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,720
that they found

1370
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,280
in particular was one of the limiters of

1371
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,319
of

1372
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,079
getting the data through uh particularly

1373
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,559
back at particularly back to earth or up

1374
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,160
to the spacecraft initially

1375
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,400
was clouds you know what with they

1376
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,160
called the all-natural laser com link

1377
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,040
limiter

1378
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,960
and what they found was that you know

1379
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,800
dtn uh worked you know

1380
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,000
just as it was supposed to uh when when

1381
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,280
things were good

1382
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,240
uh delivery uh went through uh just as

1383
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,880
expected

1384
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,760
uh bundles were uh sent that's the blue

1385
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,319
bundles were received back again

1386
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,880
when the link went down then they didn't

1387
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,559
get any of the receptions

1388
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,280
however uh once the link started to come

1389
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,599
back

1390
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,160
up the data started to trickle in and

1391
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,760
what was nice about it is this

1392
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,960
this essential recovery period here

1393
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,760
was not swamped with control information

1394
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,200
trying to re-establish

1395
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,240
a sense of obsession thereby

1396
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,559
losing you know the data opportunities

1397
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,240
to control information

1398
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,680
a little bit of control could be in

1399
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,200
extension blocks but then the rest was

1400
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,480
coming in as data

1401
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,000
and they found that this period of

1402
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,520
recovery versus

1403
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,200
other things that they had experimented

1404
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,599
with got more of the user data down

1405
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,800
faster increased their good put and

1406
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,200
and for those reasons uh nasa came back

1407
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,119
and said uh you know we we really need

1408
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,400
this technology

1409
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
for any time we're doing you know these

1410
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,319
kinds of operations

1411
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,119
and um and then essentially there were

1412
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,599
also

1413
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,359
things here where just from optical to

1414
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,040
rf rate buffering

1415
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,920
was considered valuable to them as well

1416
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,760
so so that was my last slide

1417
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,119
it's a little bit about the history of

1418
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,440
dtn it came from outer space but it has

1419
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,720
application to any kind of disruption

1420
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,400
certainly link disruption but also

1421
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,079
sometimes priority

1422
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,079
prioritization and disruption around

1423
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,599
administrative boundaries

1424
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,119
uh we've pushed out transport and

1425
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,079
security protocols we're looking at um

1426
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,079
other topics right now and if you're

1427
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,760
interested please come and see us in the

1428
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,319
working group

1429
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:18,319
well thanks and where that was uh really

1430
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,040
interesting

1431
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,599
and i think really cool i can't i mean

1432
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,839
i'm like a kid when i when i

1433
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,240
hear about this deep face stuff um so if

1434
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,040
any of you are

1435
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,040
super energized now to go be a part of

1436
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,640
vtn you have to wait about

1437
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,680
three hours uh the third session

1438
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,480
um today is dtn is having here their

1439
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:36,960
meeting

1440
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,440
ipfor to ten let's open up the queue for

1441
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,000
for questions

1442
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,119
okay i see a lot of positive comments in

1443
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,800
the

1444
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,839
in the java no wants to come to the mic

1445
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,680
so i i have a question um so uh

1446
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,839
just because like you know here at the

1447
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,680
ad level we're working on creating

1448
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,160
a little more press about what tsp is

1449
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,119
doing

1450
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,960
um and also because i'm personally

1451
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,480
interested like

1452
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,119
what has like to what extent has been

1453
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,640
deployed like i mean

1454
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,319
obviously v7 is pretty new

1455
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,079
uh um you know you just showed this demo

1456
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:24,960
here but like

1457
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,160
are any like are any probes or anything

1458
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,200
that have gone out

1459
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,920
used this or an earlier version of vtn

1460
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,680
technology

1461
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,040
so so uh yes and no uh

1462
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,960
next question no so the yes and no the

1463
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,480
um the the

1464
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,960
issue particularly on the space side is

1465
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,960
early in mission formulation

1466
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,839
uh you you really need to have the

1467
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,640
standards

1468
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,480
set and so there is we we are

1469
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,640
we are quite and keenly aware of some of

1470
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,559
the pressure to make sure that bundle

1471
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,480
protocol version 7 is out

1472
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,839
and out in in a timely fashion because

1473
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,319
uh it is necessary to have that rfc so

1474
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,599
that it can be put into

1475
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:07,520
contracts uh and requirements for

1476
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,760
missions emissions won't adopt it until

1477
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,640
however

1478
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,160
bundle protocol version 6 rfc 5050

1479
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,200
for a similar reason was taken and

1480
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,359
standardized by the ccsds

1481
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,720
the consultative committee for space

1482
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,200
data systems as as a blue book

1483
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,680
and once that happened missions did

1484
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,640
adopt it so

1485
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,920
uh nasa goddard uh has a large mission

1486
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,920
i think it's a billion dollar mission uh

1487
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,040
called pace

1488
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,160
plankton aerosol uh something

1489
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,480
and uh it will be using bundle protocol

1490
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,920
uh version six

1491
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,119
and what's interesting there is by using

1492
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:43,760
it

1493
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,079
on a spacecraft and this is not

1494
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,839
necessarily for delay and disruption but

1495
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,000
just efficiency

1496
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,680
you can have a file system and you can

1497
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,359
worry about writing to files and doing

1498
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,040
garbage collection in file systems and

1499
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:55,839
so on

1500
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,440
or if you know you're going to create

1501
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,960
persistent data

1502
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,280
and you can put it in a bundle and it

1503
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,119
only needs to be persisted so that it

1504
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:03,920
can be sent

1505
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,359
you're not going to open it and do

1506
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,760
surgery on it and save it again

1507
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,599
you you don't need the complexity of a

1508
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,520
file system to do all of that

1509
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,200
and so you you can have a little more

1510
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,640
efficient processing if you have a

1511
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,319
bundle store instead of a file system so

1512
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:16,640
i

1513
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,640
i i'm really anxious to see whether

1514
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,079
missions start seeing those kinds of

1515
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,040
benefits

1516
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,280
as they go through their deployments but

1517
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,480
it will fly

1518
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,800
on pace uh we're also going to hear in

1519
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,079

1520
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,440

1521
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,119

1526
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,119
who have non-space case

1527
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,559
uses of dtn although uh they they keep

1528
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:47,520
some of that uh

1529
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,760
private until they're ready to you know

1530
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,640

1531
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,839

00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,559
that's cool i i would like to thank ed

1533
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,559
also for this presentation because

1534
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,720
taking on dtn this was like really

1535
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:11,839
really a crash course for me

1536
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,800
our our secret agenda was just saves our

1537
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,920
head a bunch of reading

1538
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,640
yeah i think we succeeded at that um i

1539
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,599
