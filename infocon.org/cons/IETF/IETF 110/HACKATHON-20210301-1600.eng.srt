1
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,560
okay

2
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
thanks oh that seemed to work better how

3
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,319
about now

4
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,360
can people hear me okay

5
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,879
now we're here great thanks jari and uh

6
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,200
and uh thanks uh alessandro for being

7
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,280
here uh to help us out with all that

8
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
the muteco side of things um a lot of

9
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,159
great improvements to the tool

10
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
i had a chance to test drive some of

11
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
them i think it's going to work really

12
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,159
well for us but

13
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,640
sometimes takes a little getting used to

14
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
i also want to

15
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,120
recognize and say thanks to uh barry my

16
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,760
co-chair

17
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,040
he's on here too i see and uh and to the

18
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,840
rest of you

19
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,440
there's still a number of people joining

20
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
in so i'm gonna take just a couple

21
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,799
minutes

22
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,280
and probably start at five past the hour

23
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
on the actual material

24
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,159
we will be using the the queue

25
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,280
to kind of control who's who's speaking

26
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,959
you can put yourself in the queue if you

27
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,799
have something you want to say and then

28
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,680
i'll

29
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
invite you to unmute your mic

30
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
and uh if you're up for it you can send

31
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
your video

32
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,000
that can be helpful as well

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,159
we don't have any other presentations

34
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,840
planned other than the one i'll be

35
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,358
showing which won't take

36
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,079
um it won't take the whole time

37
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
certainly won't take two hours i don't

38
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
think it'll even take

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
i'll take less than half an hour so most

40
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,479
of the time will be

41
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,680
for for q a um you can jump in with

42
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,080
questions at any point though

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
um you don't have to wait till the end

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,919
for questions but we'll certainly have a

45
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,479
lot of time for questions at the end

46
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
and uh and to help people get set up and

47
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,240
one of the things we'll do

48
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,360
as well as we have a large number of

49
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,639
projects

50
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
more than 20 projects and a lot of the

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,680
the champions for the various projects

52
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
are here and then if

53
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
if any of them have anything they want

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
to say or if any of you or

55
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,440
just want to be able to ask some quick

56
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,360
clarifying questions about a specific

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,000
project

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:11,840
we can do that as well

59
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,759
and i see it's it's five after and so in

60
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,120
the interest of time whether you're

61
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,039
getting up early for this or staying up

62
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,680
late

63
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
uh we'll get started as you can see it

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
is being recorded

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,680
and that will be available for everyone

66
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
so again welcome to the hackathon as you

67
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,440
can see it will be

68
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
it's starting now and it will be running

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,560
all week

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,320
as has become our kind of new format

71
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,120
when we switch to running as a virtual

72
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,720
or online only hackathon

73
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,520
so what you see here the decision

74
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
welcome to the hackathon

75
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
this was actually the last time we were

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,759
physically in prague

77
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
it also happened to be our largest

78
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,280
hackathon in terms of overall

79
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
participation i think we had about 400

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
people

81
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
that eventually crammed into this room

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,319
and to the room outside

83
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,919
in some ways you'll be more comfortable

84
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
at this one in the comforts of your own

85
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,960
home

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
uh it's going to look a little bit more

87
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,639
like this

88
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,199
um we'll have the gather space if you

89
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
haven't tried that out yet

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
i invite you to uh to give it a try

91
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,639
we'll talk about a little bit more how

92
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,639
to use it

93
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
my understanding is there may be a

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,639
password added to that

95
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,600
and a kind of fun password not in prague

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
it doesn't seem to be an effect yet but

97
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,479
that's something that may go into effect

98
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,400
during the course of this week or next

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,840
week so

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,560
if you're prompted for a password this

101
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
should work

102
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
when i tried last night and this morning

103
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,520
there still wasn't a password needed but

104
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,120
anyways i put it in there just in case

105
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,440
um oh i also forgot to mention i have my

106
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,400
uh

107
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,199
my t-shirt from the first time we were

108
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,800
in prague which was

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,199
uh with the hackathon in prague that was

110
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,479
uh six years ago at iatf 93

111
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
and that was the one where that was an

112
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,680
important hackathon because i think

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,880
that's where

114
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
it was the second time second hackathon

115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
and that's where we really saw

116
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,759
the intf as a community kind of rallying

117
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,000
behind this idea of having a

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,639
dedicated time and space to come

119
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,199
together

120
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,400
and and work on code and things related

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,199
to code

122
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,919
or things work on code related to ietf

123
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,039
standards

124
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
and so whether we're meeting in person

125
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,199
or we're meeting like this

126
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,960
uh in more of a an online space

127
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
the goals are still the same right we're

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,479
really coming together to advance that

129
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,080
the pace and relevance

130
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
of the the work that we're doing in the

131
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,280
ietf

132
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
so there's a lot of great work that goes

133
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
on around the specifications and that's

134
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,919
how most people know us

135
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,319
is by the rfcs that come out but it's

136
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
really great if we can actually

137
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,400
work together on some code related to

138
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,759
that whether it be

139
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,120
testing out new ideas for protocols that

140
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,520
are still

141
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,240
in development or writing an

142
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,240
implementation of an existing rfc

143
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
and getting interoperability to work

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
better or just making it easier for

145
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,720
people to make use of all the great

146
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,520
uh protocols that that we have to find

147
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
so

148
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
that's all great stuff and really helps

149
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,639
the work of the ietf not only complete

150
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,520
sooner

151
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,319
but with higher quality and to you know

152
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,000
be put into practice

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
more quickly and more effectively

154
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,440
we also really look to attract i'd say a

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,200
whole different set of people who might

156
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,839
typically be attracted to

157
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,640
collaborating on uh standards the

158
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,000
standard when you think of standards

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
people you typically think of documents

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
and in the ietf we uh you know whether

161
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,200
it be github or email where

162
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
we're focusing on the text that's in

163
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
those documents and the ideas

164
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
but as we all know it's very important

165
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,080
if we want

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
the standards to be developed and used

167
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,399
that we interact with developers

168
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,920
and so we're really trying to reach out

169
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,760
more to that developer set

170
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,480
and to just bring new people who uh

171
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
maybe have great development skills and

172
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,560
are very passionate about the internet

173
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,040
and using it making it work better or

174
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,959
security or whatever their their passion

175
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,440
is

176
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
to get them interested in the ietf and

177
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
to realize hey there's

178
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,360
um interesting work going on and and

179
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
ways for them to contribute

180
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,240
uh that maybe are a little bit um more

181
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
to their liking

182
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
and so hopefully we do that as well

183
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,120
this is also a great way to match up new

184
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
people to the ietf

185
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
with people who have been working on

186
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
ietf standards for a number of years

187
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,959
and that's one of the big pluses i would

188
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,000
say and goals of the hackathon

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
so in addition to working on your code

190
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
be sure to

191
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,839
interact with people whether that be in

192
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,240
the gather space or other

193
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
things that get set up for your team to

194
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,719
work together

195
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
as with everything in the ietf we

196
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,519
operate under the notewell

197
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
now usually uh in the ietf

198
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
a lot of the work is around the drafts

199
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,800
and and the presentations at

200
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
an ietf meeting um here it's mostly

201
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,200
around the code

202
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,519
but we still have some presentations and

203
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,399
so

204
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,040
for example um when you do your

205
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,480
presentation

206
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
at the end some we'll talk about how you

207
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,519
can share your results and what you did

208
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,440
that all falls under the note well so if

209
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,839
you're not familiar with the notewell

210
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,200
have a look at it it'll help you with

211
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,959
the hackathon and know what you're

212
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,000
agreeing to

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
it'll also help you next week when

214
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,360
hopefully you stick around for the ietf

215
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,040
meeting

216
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,560
for the code itself as you might expect

217
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,079
really what governs the code you're

218
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,480
working on is the license associated

219
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,040
with it

220
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,880
in this example i'm showing it it's the

221
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,040
apache 2.0 license

222
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,959
so the code that you're working on

223
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,640
is not unless it's explicitly

224
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
states that it is it's not an ietf

225
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,680
contribution

226
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,640
it's not ietf code the rules governing

227
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,079
it are those of the project you're

228
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,920
working on and the license

229
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,120
related to that code

230
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,600
okay now to the more fun and exciting

231
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,519
stuff the projects

232
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
so all the projects are hopefully up on

233
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,920
the wiki now i see a few got added over

234
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
the last few days so

235
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
if you took a look early last week um

236
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,720
you may want to take another quick look

237
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
because a number of new projects are

238
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,800
there

239
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,439
there's more than 20 there and um

240
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
so i if you haven't already figured it

241
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
out that's a good first place to go

242
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
take a quick look at what's there see

243
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
what's of interest to you

244
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
you can see all the champions have

245
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,720
identified themselves and a way to

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,839
contact them

247
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,600
so even if they're not on this call

248
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
right now you can

249
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,480
reach out to them via whatever mechanism

250
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
they provided

251
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,639
on the wiki and if you have a hard time

252
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,240
connecting with anyone you can always

253
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,200
reach out to me i'll try to help

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,600
but also we have this page this wiki

255
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,480
page

256
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,839
lost and found and uh when i made this

257
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
slide at least no one had entered

258
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
anything there yet

259
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
but the idea is throughout the course of

260
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,839
this week

261
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,959
if um you know you have some things you

262
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,639
want to work on but they don't seem to

263
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,160
line up really well with any of the

264
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
projects

265
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,839
you can add yourself to the skills to

266
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,560
offer

267
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,079
and similarly if you're championing a

268
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
project or working on a project and you

269
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
guys really need someone

270
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,200
with some specific you know skill say to

271
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
code something up or

272
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
run right the front end for a web app or

273
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480
the back end or whatever

274
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
you can put that here so that's just a

275
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,319
good way to help people connect

276
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
okay so uh you're all here for the

277
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,519
kickoff which you can see

278
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,120
we do have the two hours and as i

279
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,959
mentioned i don't expect us to need all

280
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,000
of that

281
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
um as soon as this is over though all

282
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,360
the teams

283
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
are uh free to go and work on their

284
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,600
projects

285
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,160
on their own timescape schedule and the

286
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,360
reason we've done this

287
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,560
is because of time zones and uh

288
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,079
you know just the fact that it's hard to

289
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
get people to meet when you're all over

290
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,480
the world

291
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
at different places different things

292
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,320
going on

293
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,639
we figure okay we'll have the whole week

294
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,760
and so

295
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
teams are free to meet you know for

296
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,000
blocks of time every single day

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
or just on certain days but the best way

298
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,120
to see

299
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
when a team is meeting and for a team to

300
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
advertise when they're meeting is to put

301
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,399
on the team schedule and i'm showing

302
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,399
that wiki page here

303
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,920
um the team champions i highly recommend

304
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,959
if you haven't yet uh to go and add some

305
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,160
information there

306
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,560
i i put some for the chairs i see the

307
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,600
quick team

308
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
um put how to get in contact with them

309
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,800
and then you can take it from there

310
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,000
right

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
as to how the team's going to work and

312
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,760
you can update this during the course of

313
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,959
the week to add new

314
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,920
new uh new times and new ways to meet

315
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,720
then on friday at the end of this week

316
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,399
at basically the same time as the

317
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,079
kickoff that's when we'll be having the

318
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,120
closing

319
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
now for this one i i expect it will take

320
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,079
close to the full two hours of time

321
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,000
but that really depends on how many

322
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
teams present their results

323
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
and we'll talk later on about how the

324
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,199
results presentations work

325
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,360
but really the whole idea of the closing

326
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
is to come together

327
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,480
now the week's done and for people to

328
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
show hey this is what we got this is

329
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,079
what we accomplished

330
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,440
and and so every team has the

331
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,079
opportunity

332
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,839
to present you don't have to present but

333
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,920
it's certainly uh very helpful

334
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
and i'll provide some more information

335
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,359
on that in later slides

336
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,920
so at the beginning i gave you kind of a

337
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,360
snapshot of the

338
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,399
what the entire gather space looked like

339
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,839
um and that's what you're seeing here

340
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
when you first come into the space it

341
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
actually uh it gives you a handy little

342
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,199
tutorial about how to use gather and

343
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,760
interact in the space in general

344
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,720
once you're inside of it over on the

345
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,279
right hand side and the lower

346
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,360
lower right corner there that's where

347
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,800
the hackathon

348
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,320
space actually is and so you can go on

349
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
over to there you can see my tiny little

350
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
character here

351
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,639
about to enter and as you enter the

352
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,680
hackathon space

353
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
it you actually enter into a dedicated

354
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,360
space for the hackathon

355
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,880
where it's a little bit easier to

356
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
interact with just the people in the

357
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,639
hackathon space if that's what you want

358
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,839
to do

359
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,839
an example of that there's this podium

360
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,680
up here where if we were meeting in

361
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,199
person i'd probably be standing there

362
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,560
delivering

363
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,600
from this presentation from there but if

364
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,000
i was

365
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,680
to go to that podium i would actually

366
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,519
have the ability to

367
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,560
um communicate with all of you

368
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
in like a conference setting i may try

369
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,279
that out at some point

370
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,120
just to see how well it works if there's

371
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,880
a lot of us there it'll be interesting

372
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,680
to see

373
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
how well it works but um anyways that's

374
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,199
one example

375
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,399
now you notice there are many different

376
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,120
tables

377
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,639
here and some are labeled to be used for

378
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
one of the ietf areas

379
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,519
and some just have letters during the

380
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,040
course of this week

381
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
really the main focus of this entire

382
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,440
space

383
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
is to serve the hackathon so

384
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,399
you know you're welcome to use one of

385
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,759
the letter tables

386
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,600
but you can also use one of the other

387
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,240
tables that that's for one of the areas

388
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
that's perfectly fine as well

389
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,120
you can see there's these sort of more

390
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,959
informal uh

391
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,800
areas when you enter into one of these

392
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
basically anyone who enters into one of

393
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
these tables and takes a seat

394
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
or anyone who goes into one of these

395
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,160
lounge

396
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,279
little uh couch areas will be able to

397
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,520
be in sort of a video conference with

398
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,679
the other people who are also there

399
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,760
so it just helps people to um

400
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,319
collaborate in a virtual environment

401
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,240
and so i you know recommend that you

402
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,839
test that out

403
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,679
one of the really cool things is you'll

404
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,000
notice on most of the tables if not all

405
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,799
of them

406
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,799
they have either one of these notepads

407
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,400
which is um

408
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,079
you can go up to it and interact with it

409
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,000
by pressing x

410
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,919
and then you it pops up a cody md

411
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,240
like shared document that everyone who's

412
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,280
at that table

413
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,799
or you know anyone who comes up and

414
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,039
interacts with it can can use

415
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,760
so that's a handy way for your team to

416
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
like share notes and

417
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,880
those types of things other tables have

418
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,240
a whiteboard

419
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,720
and then it's more of an interactive

420
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
whiteboard where you can draw things out

421
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,200
or do whatever you want to do so both

422
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,720
mechanisms are there

423
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,039
you may want to choose your table

424
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,240
depending on which one

425
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,960
you think you'd be more likely to use

426
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
those came in real handy at the last

427
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,559
hackathon and i'm sure they will at this

428
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,200
one as well

429
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
other than that there are uh there's a

430
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,799
complete guide

431
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
that's been put out for all ietf uh

432
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,120
110 participants and there is a little

433
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,000
section there

434
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,440
on the on gather i believe it's going to

435
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,679
be built out in a bit more detail

436
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
but really i think you'll find the um

437
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,960
just a little tutorial at the beginning

438
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,799
get you up to speed pretty quickly it's

439
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,400
not that complex a tool

440
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,679
and other than that just go and

441
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,120
experiment a little bit i think you'll

442
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,720
find it pretty intuitive

443
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,880
and easy to use and hopefully a great

444
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,400
way to collaborate

445
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,320
uh during the course of this week and

446
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,840
next week for the ietf meeting

447
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,919
okay one one bit of bad news for those

448
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,000
of you who uh

449
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,440
didn't know this one of the cool things

450
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,200
we've been able to do in the past

451
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,160
is provide a way to connect in to

452
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,880
the ietf network remotely and that

453
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,720
helped if you wanted to work on certain

454
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,799
technologies that really required that

455
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,480
sort of being all connected into the

456
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,880
same layer 2 switch or

457
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,840
or you need some dedicated network

458
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,039
requirements

459
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
and that's always been provided at sort

460
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,960
of a as part of an experimental

461
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
best effort type of thing we ran into

462
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
some snags with that this year

463
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
or for this hackathon unfortunately

464
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,520
there's a few of you who got your

465
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,720
request in early

466
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,919
and were actually able to um to meet

467
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,440
your requests but

468
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,559
we had to um uh we're not accepting any

469
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,240
new requests right now

470
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
just due to a number of circumstances

471
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,799
including

472
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,120
helping out with with covid and the

473
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,360
distribution of the vaccine

474
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
uh being kind of a priority where some

475
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,679
of the folks who are going to volunteer

476
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,320
time

477
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,000
don't have time to focus on this so um

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
anyways it's it's a great thing we're

479
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
not giving up on it we plan

480
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
to offer this capability not only for um

481
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,159
online hackathons like this one but even

482
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,400
for in-person hackathons to help

483
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,559
um with administering the network and

484
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,400
allowing remote participants to work

485
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,480
more effectively with their teams

486
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
so hopefully this won't be a big problem

487
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,840
for those of you who

488
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
um if you were planning on using it

489
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
hopefully you got your request in early

490
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,400
and we were able to get you set up

491
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
otherwise if you haven't been set up yet

492
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
you know my apologies

493
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,320
okay project presentation so i mentioned

494
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,039
this

495
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
we uh we do these at the end of the

496
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,600
hackathon during that closing session

497
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,760
which is on friday at the same time as

498
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,960
this this kicked off

499
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,400
and the idea there is to recap

500
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,200
here's what our team was trying to solve

501
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,039
and here's what we achieved and here are

502
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,600
the things we learned along the way

503
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
um these are very short presentations

504
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,720
and so the goal is not to dive into the

505
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,760
the full extent

506
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,120
the full you know deep dive into it it's

507
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
you know think about your audience that

508
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,679
it's a technical audience but maybe not

509
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,039
an audience that

510
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,159
is familiar with your exact project or

511
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,400
the working group drafts that you're you

512
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,320
know related to what you're doing

513
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,400
so they have a good grasp of ietf

514
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,559
technology overall but maybe not your

515
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,080
specific area

516
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,440
we really want to know like like what

517
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,679
did you learn what did you achieve

518
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,679
uh what are you going to feed back into

519
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,440
your working group like

520
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
did you find out that the working group

521
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
giraffes are right on target

522
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,159
or did you find some problems or

523
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,840
something's missing or some things that

524
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,600
you think should be changed

525
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
uh you know those types of things are

526
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,760
handy to know

527
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
we're also very interested in as i

528
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,840
mentioned at the beginning

529
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
kind of extending the branching out the

530
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,000
ietf community and

531
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,240
interacting with with new people with

532
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,760
new communities so

533
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
if you're working on an open source

534
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,360
project that's maybe housed

535
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,240
outside of the ietf or you're working on

536
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,919
something related to another

537
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,600
sdo perhaps some yang models that

538
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
while the itf to find the yang models

539
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,640
you're working

540
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,280
uh sorry to find that the yang language

541
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,360
and netconf and rescoff perhaps the yang

542
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
models themselves

543
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,880
are being defined in another sdo and

544
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,480
you're working on that

545
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,720
these are just all examples that i think

546
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
are interesting for us to know so we can

547
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,320
see how our community that you know is

548
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,919
expanded beyond just what we would

549
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,919
typically think of at an ivf meeting

550
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,080
based on the number of people who want

551
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,440
to present

552
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,559
um their projects um

553
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,440
we'll decide how long they can be but my

554
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
guess is as a good rule of thumb

555
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,880
and this is what happened to the last

556
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,559
two ietfs

557
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,240
we were able to allow five-minute

558
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,480
presentations and we will be pretty

559
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
strict in fact there's some new tools

560
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,640
and

561
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
meet echo to help us to be strict

562
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,679
where we can set a timer and we'll make

563
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,360
sure that we keep to time

564
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,679
so that everyone gets a chance to

565
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,640
present

566
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
and you're basically presenting within

567
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,559
me techo much like i am now

568
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,919
sharing your presentation the way we

569
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,200
facilitate that

570
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,400
is using the ietf

571
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,039
hackathon github organization if you

572
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,440
haven't seen this already

573
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,640
it's a place where well for one

574
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
it's where we keep all of our

575
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,880
presentations related to the hackathon

576
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,600
so you'll see a project for iatf109

577
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,240
there's one for ietf110

578
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
that's where this kickoff presentation

579
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
exists so if you want to download it you

580
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
can

581
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,360
it's also where a lot of the hackathon

582
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,000
projects

583
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,840
exist you can see this one here

584
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,200
exists there so you don't have to put

585
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,480
your projects here

586
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,159
but it is kind of a handy way if you

587
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,640
don't already have a home somewhere else

588
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
um we're very happy to create a repo

589
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,600
here for you

590
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,720
to house the code for your project

591
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,960
so if you want that let me know reach

592
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
out to me and i will

593
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,159
create a new repo for you but for

594
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,840
everyone who plans to present

595
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
in the at the end of the hackathon or

596
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,840
even if you don't want to present

597
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,360
but you just want to capture your

598
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,120
results for everyone else to see

599
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
which i highly recommend that you

600
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,799
capture the results regardless

601
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
of whether anyone's available to present

602
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,240
on friday

603
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
the idea is that you would

604
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,520
upload those presentations into the ietf

605
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,480
110

606
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,919
project presentations so if you go into

607
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:46,960
that

608
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,159
uh that repo uh and you go to the readme

609
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,600
that's what i'm showing here there's

610
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,240
some instructions about that

611
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,080
the important thing that i want to point

612
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,840
out right now is

613
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,640
in order to in order to make this just

614
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
work a little bit easier

615
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,720
what i'd like to do is give everyone the

616
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,240
ability to

617
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,360
you know to commit directly into this

618
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
repo

619
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,919
and in order for that to happen you

620
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,679
basically need to be a member of the

621
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,760
ietf hackathon

622
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,320
github org so if you've been added for

623
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
another itf hackathon you're fine you

624
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,760
don't need to do it again

625
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,640
but if you're not a member you need to

626
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,760
get added

627
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,000
and the way to do that is to

628
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
send an email to hackathonchairs.itf.org

629
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
but make sure on github that your github

630
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,039
account

631
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,440
has your name because that just helps us

632
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,880
identify who you are

633
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,480
because sometimes it's really tough with

634
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,000
um user ids which can be a bit cryptic

635
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
and also please enable two-factor

636
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,039
authentication

637
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,960
it's probably a good practice regardless

638
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
but you know it just helps us

639
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
keep people from hacking into the the

640
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,760
itf github

641
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,840
so would appreciate that and actually

642
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,960
require that

643
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,320
before we will add you in and the other

644
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,960
thing is

645
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,559
if you're planning on presenting which i

646
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,480
hope you do uh

647
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,320
the sooner you do this like if you do it

648
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,480
today that's great get yourself added if

649
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,840
you're not there already

650

uh don't wait till friday or even

651
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,960
thursday night

652
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,279
because with time zones and other things

653
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
you know things get busy

654
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,559
i may miss something we may not get you

655
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
added so so don't wait

656
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
till last minute please you can upload

657
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
your presentation pretty late but get

658
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,039
yourself all set up

659
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,039
and make sure that you're able to upload

660
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,240
it early on

661
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
and then like you know like what you can

662
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,679
always do with github

663
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,360
you can upload an initial version of

664
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,799
your presentation and then upload

665
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,600
another one

666
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,799
there's no problem with that

667
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,360
we have a couple templates that you are

668
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
welcome to use you don't have to use

669
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,279
these we just make them available and a

670
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,720
lot of people do find it useful

671
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,440
for for your project presentations

672
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,240
there's

673
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,880
one available in powerpoint format which

674
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,840
is the same

675
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
very similar to what we've made

676
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,039
available in the past

677
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,200
thanks to benson we also have one in uh

678
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,480
html

679
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,360
format which is much lighter weight um

680
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,840
kind of

681
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,400
more code like i would say and certainly

682
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,720
takes up a lot less space in general

683
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,159
when you when you upload them um

684
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,760
and so you're welcome to use that

685
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,480
template um as you can see where we

686
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,559
you know we're happy to add more

687
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,159
templates we're happy to have them be

688
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,120
improved over

689
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,679
over time both of them are fairly simple

690
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,520
both of them can probably be better

691
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,200
if you have some suggestions you can

692
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,039
always send us a pull request to make

693
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,120
those better too

694
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,799
but anyways they're there just to help

695
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,559
you get started and hopefully

696
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,880
uh put your your project presentation

697
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,039
together with like minimal

698
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,760
effort on the how to do it and you can

699
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
just focus on the important things you

700
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,399
gathered

701
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,480
or that you learned which is really the

702
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,399
important thing right

703
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,840
so hopefully you find those useful

704
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,279
um then before i open it up to questions

705
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,080

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,240
we're not meeting in person

710
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,399
uh but you know there are still costs

711
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,919

after an initial set of questions then

729
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
uh the last thing we'll do is kind of

730
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,279
open it up for any project champions

731
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,720
that just want to share a bit more

732
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,799
information about what they're doing

733
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,640
but i'd like to get any questions first

734
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,440

735
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,880

of projects who want to share something

746
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,720

747
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600

questions people may have

754
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,879
there is one thing i think

755
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,480

schedule i want to show people that

757
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,679

i'll stop sharing the screen

767
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,919
okay you should be able to

768
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,600
share your audio right now if i

769
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
understand correctly and alessandra if

770
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,000

presentation page within the wiki

784
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,960
and uh you can see we have one project

785
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,519
already

786
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,120
listed here um and i would encourage you

you don't have to have your presentation

789
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,119
ready you just this is just the way to

790

say that yes you do want to present and

791
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,119
you can find it

792
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,480
if you're on the hackathon wiki and you

793
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,280
go down

794
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,440
into the meeting materials here

795
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,918
there is a link for results presentation

796
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,040
schedule

797
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
if you click on that it'll take you to

798
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,399
this page

799
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,159
and anyone can add themselves to this

800
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,480
anyone can add anything to the to the

801
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,000
wiki you will need an

802
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
account and there are some instructions

803
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,280
there on how to set that up

804
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,918
but those are freely available and tied

805
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,719
to your data tracker account so

806
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,239
if you are on this presentation now you

807
00:34:50,239 --> 00:35:03,839
should be set up for doing that as well

808
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,160
yeah paul sorry we weren't able to get

809
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
your audio working but yeah perhaps if

810
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,839
you hadn't granted

811
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,839
access okay we'll try again now

812
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,960
looks like you should be able to send

813
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,720
audio and video we can see your video

814
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,280
no still still not hearing you though

815
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,839
seems to be some problem with your mic

816
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,480
and alessandra is that or lorenzo asked

817
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
in the chat

818
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,800
when you see the mic lines moving under

819
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,880
your name when you talk

820
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,800
i can see those for example online

821
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
whenever i speak

822
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,599
there's a little blue lines right right

823
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,200
underneath my uh

824
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,320
my profile picture

825
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,920
and they kind of go up and down as my

826
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,480
voice does

827
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,400
yeah if anyone else has any questions um

828
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,320
the muteco team is working with paul to

829
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,760
get get that straightened out

830
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,800
any questions any project pitches this

831
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,839
is your big chance

832
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,720
to recruit people

833
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,440
much harder to do i think in a virtual

834
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,320
environment

835
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,920
at least it's a little bit more

836
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
challenging than when you're right there

837
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,920
in person and someone can just walk up

838
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,240
but

839
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,680
uh you know we do have the whole week

840
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,280
and that's that's one good thing

841
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,599
and like i said if uh look at the wiki

842
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,359
if if um

843
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,040
if you're trying to figure out a project

844
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,599
to join there's the

845
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,000
lost and found then you can always reach

846
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,680
out to me you can also send something to

847
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,680
the hackathon list but that's perfectly

848
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,800
fine

849
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,680
and then the other thing is go and

850
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,160
gather

851
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,839
and see if you find the people there

852
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,480
once we drop off of this kickoff session

853
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,320
i'll probably go and

854
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,839
play around with the gather space a

855
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,320
little bit it's uh if you haven't really

856
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
uh if you couldn't tell from the slides

857
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,000
or if you haven't been in it yet

858
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
it's all redesigned from iatf 109.

859
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,440
there are some things that are similar

860
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,359
but it certainly has a lot of new

861
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,720
capabilities to it

862
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,920
much like me techo just improving uh

863
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,359
dramatically with lots of new

864
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:54,480
functionality

865
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,640
for each ietf meeting which is great to

866
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,599
see

867
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:58,880
and i'm sure it's going to be really

868
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,119
beneficial to us even

869
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,280
when we do start meeting in person again

870
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:19,839
which i hope happens pretty soon

871
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,760

emailing list analysis in the big bang

883

project

884
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,359
we already have a pretty nice code base

885
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,480
working

886
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
we can ingress a lot of email we also

887

got working with

888
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,359
with the data tracker and we're doing a

889
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,400
lot of analysis on uh discussion

890
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,119
uh about standards and their adoption so

891
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,800
if people are interested feel free to

join especially people

893
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
uh working on python graphic people

894
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,240
working on visualization we're also

895
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,040
trying to make

896
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,200
the tool more accessible to get more

897
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,480
people because we're getting a lot of

898
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,359
people

899
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,320
asking us how the tool works and perhaps

900
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,839
branching out a bit

901
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,000
into knowledge graphs so if people are

902
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
interested in that

903
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,960

912
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,480
should reach out to you whether that

913

i don't know a webex session or

916
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720

925
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,680
just want to get back to

926
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,599
uh to working on your code or other

927
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,839
other things you need to prepare

928
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,720

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,240
pretty much covered everything so so

935
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,160
thanks to all of you for joining

936
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,640
uh we'll wrap up at at this point and um

937
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,200
be available throughout the week on uh

938
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,920
you can contact me directly and gather

939
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
um on barry as well at the hackathon

940
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,240
chairs

941
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,480
uh list if you want to just talk to us

942
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,359
that way

943
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,079
you know or via the hackathon at itf.org

944
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:26,800
list

945
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,240
if you want to reach out to everyone um

946
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,960
and then uh you know so they'll probably

947
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,720
be some updates during the course of the

948
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,400
week we'll share those via the

949
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,000
the hackathon list other than that let

950
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,520
me go back up

951
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,079
and kind of wrap up with just a quick

952
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,520
look at our agenda again

953
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,160
just to make sure everyone knows the

954
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,240
timing of things

955
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,520
but pretty pretty simple um

956
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,480
working on at your own pace and filling

957
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,400
out things in the team schedule i highly

958
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,440
recommend that

959
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,079
and then on friday at this same time is

960
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,200
when we'll come together

961
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,040
using meet techo again to do the

962
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,400
presentations

963
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,240
and if you would like to do a

964
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,959
presentation

965
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,040
whether you're going to present it live

966
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,359
or not uh please upload it

967
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:23,200
to the uh to the github

968
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,920
org that was mentioned here but if you

969
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,920
do want to present live which i highly

970
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,359
encourage someone from the team

971
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,560
it doesn't need to be the project

972
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,000
champion make sure that you get your

973
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,640
project and i see we have one more on

974
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,079
there already

975
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,640
in this list and then we will just

976
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,119
present

977
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,280
in order that people are on the list if

978
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,160
you have a specific

979
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,000
reason why you need to present out of

980
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,359
order let me know

981
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,800
we can we can rearrange things um or

982
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,720
you know whatever so we can be kind of

983
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,640
flexible but just so that people know

984
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,400
what to expect we'll kind of plan on

985
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,000
going in order

986
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,079
you can plan for five minutes per

987
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,520
project if we get

988
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,480
more presentations than we can handle

989
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,160
we'll probably reduce that down to say

990
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,680
four minutes but

991
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,400
but i think we should be good okay

992
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,920
well thank you everyone i really

993
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,839
appreciate you joining and i hope you

994
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,440
have a great hackathon

995
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,240
and really a great two weeks at ietf

996
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,160
110.

997
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,839
so take care and talk to you again soon
