1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
so

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,400
so go ahead and get going instead

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,160
yeah so you are taking notes right

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
yeah i'll take notes although what i did

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
last time the last couple of times

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,160
i've just went back and looked at the

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
video

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
to make sure i got it right so um

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
i think as long as the recording goes

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,879
well then it's gonna be perfect

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,520
if that video doesn't work then we're

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:47,920
kind of

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,640
messed more it's kind of a failure but

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,239
yeah i'll take care of it

15
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,000
yeah okay i yeah i guess we can

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,530
get started then um

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,320
[Music]

republic

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,840
um ideally we should have been there um

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,200
so let's see

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,000

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,400
so

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,430
also before

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,529
[Music]

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,439
and this is the agenda for today

30
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
let us know if you have any comments on

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,840
the agenda

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
so the first item is that

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,119
mike and i will go through the working

34
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,920
group status

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,840
so um

36
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,240
yeah this is our current status um

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,119
we have a couple of young models that

38
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,439
are

39
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,079
still in the rfc editors queue they have

40
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,280
been there quite a while

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,520
and i'm not sure how long how much

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,399
longer it will take

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
we've got two drafts that we requested

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,238
publications since last time

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,319
and then we had the dr improvement draft

46
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,840
that was returned to the

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,160
working group some months ago before the

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,840
previous idea

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
and it needs some more work and there's

50
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,920
been changes to that some improvements

51
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,239
and

52
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,599
will be discussed today uh

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,720
also the bell register packing draft

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,239
was returned to the working group

55
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,800
requiring more work and

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,360
it's also been a revision of that and

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,519
discussion today

58
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,560
in both of those in both of those drafts

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,920
uh i will do a better job of uh

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,519
reviewing them before we send them to

61
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
alvaro because in both cases it probably

62
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,000
should have been not sent out

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,159
so that's my bad um so i'll

64
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,080
make sure that they're thoroughly vetted

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,040
before we send them to you

66
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,640
yeah in in general we also have an issue

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
with not getting enough review in a

68
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,599
working group

69
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
so i'm glad that we we managed to uh

70
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
not register packing we actually got a

71
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
few people volunteering to give it a

72
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,159
good review and

73
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,879
that was great and uh should try to do

74
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,840
that more

75
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,080
then we have some more drafts we have

76
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,640
the

77
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,879
igmlt proxy young model nothing new

78
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,760
since last time i'll start packing

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
there's a new revision that will be

80
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,360
presented today um

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
we have the sr point to point multiply

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,159

83

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
version to internet standard

86
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,319
so uh we've been a little slow with that

87
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
um against the volunteers that did a

88
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,040
great job getting a story together and

89
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,759
we

90
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,720
got the results and um there's this

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
draft that i mentioned before

92
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
that has the results so please have a

93
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,400
look at that

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,720
uh we're going to start the actual work

95
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
of

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,800
revising these rfcs so looking for

97
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,680
volunteers

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
to work on that i asked on the mailing

99
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,320
list that

100
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,840
maybe that's a handful of people already

101
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,160
um

102
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,240
but yeah if you are interested please

103
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
respond to that email

104
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,120
or just get in touch i'll set up a

105
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
meeting in

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,960
a couple of weeks where the volunteers

107
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,919
can

108
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,960
discuss how they want to do their work

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,758
but basically

110
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,199
the work is to fix any errata

111
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,199
remove anything that hasn't been

112
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
sufficiently implemented or deployed

113
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,400
clarify things where there might be

114
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,599
interoperability issues

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,840
and that's about it any more comments

116
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,080
i think we can move on to the first

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,039
presentation though

118
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,840
with this vr improvement i'll bring up

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,320
the slides here

120
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,479
yeah just as you look at that agenda we

121
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,560
did make a little bit of adjustment with

122
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
typically we do working group drafts

123
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
first and then individual dress

124
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
after they're done we did make some

125
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,360
adjustments for some personal reasons

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
to have some individual drafts go

127
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
earlier so just um

128
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
just note that it's not typical

129
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:21,840
okay i need to reshare

130
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:35,840
all right monkey mana are you ready

131
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,120
am i audible

132
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,280
yeah okay yeah so we can

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
go to the next slide so good morning

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
good afternoon good evening

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,280
and so i'll be presenting on behalf of

136
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,039
sandy and other authors

137
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,520
some some of the modification which we

138
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,240
did

139
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,280
in this draft after it is

140
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,520
review comment so we can go to the next

141
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,840
slide

142
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,520
so one section of this draft will be so

143
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
basically there are two drops which i am

144
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,759
going to present side by side one is

145
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,840
this pim dr improvement and there is one

146
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,360
more for backup dr

147
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,000
election which is coming next and both

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,919
of them are

149
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,639
i would say that there is a problem

150
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,280
statement

151
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,520
which i think both of them are trying to

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,560
solve almost

153
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,319
similar problem statement but there are

154
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,800
different both are different mechanism

155
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,080
so i'll first cover in this what what

156
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,199
has been updated

157
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,360
in version 10 and 11 which is after

158
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,319
it ads review comment so some of the

159
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,680
section arrangement

160
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
got modified and there was so

161
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
with respect to solution major solution

162
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,639
has not changed it

163
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
remains as is the way it was before even

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,919
got accepted in the working group and

165
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
working with last car

166
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,319
and there were more detail added from

167
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:04,960
the

168
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,759
algorithm side itself and there was a

169
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,879
request to add

170
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,039
two different sections or another i

171
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,319
would say that

172
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,039
pointing towards two one of the draft

173
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,560
and one of the rfc

174
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,599
and the rfc is dr load balancing rfc so

175
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,080
that

176
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,479
got added that how exactly it is going

177
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
to work with drlb

178
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,199
rfc and if there were there were a

179
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,240
couple of

180
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,720
places where content where duplicate

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,440
they have been

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,039
removed and we added

183
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,479
some more description to make sure that

184
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,279
those specifications are clear enough

185
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,919
and

186
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,159
there were couple of editorial changes

187
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
for which we had got comment so we can

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,959
go to the next section

189
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,480
so election algorithm just to kind of uh

190
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,080
recall that

191
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
each dr uh among the dr candidate

192
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
they will so basically the election

193
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
algorithm goes

194
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,360
uh almost similar to the actual team rfc

195
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,000
but

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
we have some extra hello options where

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
you will uh

198
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,480
any router will basically announce that

199
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
they do support

200
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
this specification and once

201
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
dr has been elected the dr

202
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,959
ip address will also be centered oops

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
third flight

204
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,880
so we are there dr address will also

205
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,279
be sent in the hello options so that

206
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:39,920
even if

207
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,880
new router comes up with higher priority

208
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,320
it is not going to take over so it gives

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,959
us a option for dr to be a sticky

210
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,399
and ddr is going to be elected among the

211
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,880
rest of the candidate other than the dr

212
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,519
which is we can consider it as a second

213
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,000
best

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,040
dr in the land and that is not sticky

215
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,399
and dr and bdr options which has been

216
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,440
received in hello

217
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
is stored locally and that is more of

218
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
implementation to make sure that

219
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,120
you can handle the case when some new

220
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,440
router comes or if

221
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
your priority changes you're not going

222
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
to you're not trying to take over as

223
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
idea

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
and election algorithm which has been

225
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
defined in team rfc 0761

226
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,600
has been slightly modified to adopt

227
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,880
these some of the new steps next slide

228
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,360
and so before

229
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,079
even going to the election there is a

230
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,240
modification in hello exchange so with

231
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,800
hello

232
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,920
now we are going to send a

233
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,399
dr address option and pdr address option

234
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,720
and initially both of them will be set

235
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,560
as zero sorry it is dr address option

236
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
and both of them will be set as a zero

237
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
and after default old timer expires dr

238
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,040
and vtr will be elected

239
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
and one more thing to note down here

240
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,480
that

241
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,200
this specification will work only if all

242
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
the routers on the lan

243
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,000
they do support this particular steps

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,920
if one of the router then support we are

245
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,519
going to fall back to

246
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
base base bim functionality

247
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
here next

248
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,600
so working with dr lb so rfc 8775

249
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,279
which became standard i think last year

250
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,640
so with dr load balancing option there

251
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,040
are

252
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,079
list list of uh

253
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
there are list of candidate which will

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,480
be sent in the hello option so

255
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,399
with this specification if

256
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,440
those lists are supporting uh

257
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,800
mdr improvement route or mdr improvement

258
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
then these option has to be added in

259
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,320
eight seven seven

260
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,040
five and if it doesn't support then it

261
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,680
will

262
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,560
the drlb list will not advertise this

263
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
particular

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
option and same thing for

265
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,440
bdr is something similar to

266
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,480
group dr where which has been defined in

267
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
8775

268
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,920
so the next next step for

269
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,800
you can go to the next the next step for

270
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
this draft will be

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,519
to have more review and provide us

272
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,639
comment

273
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:53,839
and based on that we can take it forward

274
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,880
so we can go to the next uh

275
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,000
stick maybe people have question command

276
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,399
together

277
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,519
yeah just get into the next one sure

278
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,920
all right it's here now yeah okay yeah

279
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
so

280
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,600
the previous draft which we spoke about

281
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,639
though it does

282
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,560
like backup dr and it talks about

283
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,240
stickiness so there are

284
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
two uh i would say there is a major

285
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,279
difference between

286
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,680
both of these draft so this draft is

287
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,720
trying to simplify

288
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
if we really need an extension in

289
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,440
pin hello itself to elect the premiere

290
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,720
so we can go to the next slide

291
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,079
so this draft was presented the few idf

292
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:08,800
back so just

293
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,639
just to recall that by default

294
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
what exactly is a problem statement so

295
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,120
if you see here uh very simple

296
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,760
topology so left hand side you consider

297
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,440
that left hand side the

298
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,399
r8 and r9 both of them are two pin

299
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,920
router on the lan

300
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
and r8 had dr priority as 91

301
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,519
and r9 has their priority as a 90.

302
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,680
so what is going to happen in easily r8

303
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
will be elected as a dr

304
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
and rf r8 is going to pull the traffic

305
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,600
from the source and

306
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,480
forward it on the shared lag but if

307
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,079
there is any failure happening

308
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
in the r8 so there are certain steps

309
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,800
which are involved before

310
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,639
the receiver can start getting the

311
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,639
traffic and those steps are

312
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,160
first r9 has to detect the failure

313
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
and then r9 has to rebuild

314
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,360
the tree i think except

315
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,320
you can still be in the slide too i had

316
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,920
removed all the animation because it was

317
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,040
becoming confusing

318
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,600
select tool so

319
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,959
so now r9 will be elected as idea r9

320
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,880
will start building tree towards

321
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,399
source and that is when then finally r9

322
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,199
is going to

323
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,480
forward traffic to the receiver now

324
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,759
this step there are there is going to be

325
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,360
some extra time taken

326
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,680
because the total time will be first

327
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,399
thing

328
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,120
r9 detects the failure and then r9

329
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,240
starts building

330
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
the tree and starts getting the traffic

331
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,120
but there are requirements there are

332
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
lots of customers where multicast

333
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:50,480
because

334
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
looking at the way network is growing

335
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
and the way mindset is changing with

336
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
respect to convergence

337
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,959
so requirement is to achieve a faster

338
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,560
convergence

339
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,720
and to achieve faster convergence there

340
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
are there are

341
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,040
trade-offs where it is possible to have

342
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
life traffic but still achieve a

343
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,680
so having faster convergence is

344
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
a requirement compared to saving the

345
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,480
bandwidth so we can go to the next slide

346
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,360
that's like three

347
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,959
a little bit bigger stick please

348
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
maybe just yeah

349
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,160
thanks yeah so so in this case

350
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,399
that is where backup dr comes into the

351
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,959
picture and the overall functionality of

352
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,880
backup dr is to actually kind of

353
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,040
build the tree parallel to your actual

354
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,240
dr

355
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
and keep all the states with respect to

356
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:57,920
pin protocol

357
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,199
ready at r9 and as soon as

358
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,639
you detect the failure you start

359
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,880
forwarding so in this case

360
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,599
the overall convergence hit what you are

361
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,720
going to get is

362
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,760
how fast r9 can detect this failure

363
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,559
and using the we have bfd and many other

364
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,280
mechanisms where r8 to r9 failure can be

365
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,199
detected pretty fast

366
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,480
and that is what it is going to save

367
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,520
save time with respect to convergence

368
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,439
in this draft the mechanism which has

369
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,880
been defined

370
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,240
is using the fact that when we are doing

371
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,200
dr election

372
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,640
basically we are running a bim rfc

373
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,919
algorithm which has been defined in 7761

374
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,640
and if i want to run if i want to elect

375
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,080
a backup here essentially

376
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,520
it is the second best dr so why not to

377
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,919
run

378
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,840
two algorithm where all the

379
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
routers on the lan they can run first

380
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,600
thing they can run

381
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,320
is dr and they will get to know who is

382
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
the dr

383
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,840
second thing they will run a backup dr

384
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,679
and backup dr is going to be the second

385
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,559
best dr

386
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,880
and now the rest of the rest of the

387
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
outdoors they don't need to know

388
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,559
uh whether there is a backup they are

389
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,039
elected or my company are not elected

390
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,919
so that is that is what the mechanism of

391
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,120
this rock usage

392
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,679
and that there is no need to have extra

393
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,720
hello options

394
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,360
among the routers so we can go to the

395
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,720
next slide

396
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
so yes as i think it even discussed in

397
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,600
the previous draft lots of

398
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
vendors and lots of end customers they

399
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,200
do want

400
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
stickiness in the mdr functionality and

401
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
reason for that if there is any new

402
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,919
router coming

403
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,200
into the network which has better

404
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,480
priority

405
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,679
it will it will cause a churn in the

406
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
lan site and the reason for churn is

407
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,280
since dr

408
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,799
gets changed now new dr has to build all

409
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,919
the

410
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,320
multicast tree and then it will start

411
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
forwarding traffic

412
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,679
to the axis and these chunks may not be

413
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,120
really needed and the reason i can think

414
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,360
of couple of reasons it could be just

415
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
maybe configuration that someone

416
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,280
accidentally configured higher

417
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,160
their priority it was not the intention

418
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,640
but

419
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
even these kind of accidents may cause a

420
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,600
lot of traffic jam and so customers

421
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
are vendors they really want to have a

422
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,919
stickiness feature

423
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,160
stickiness functionality yeah we can go

424
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,559
to the next

425
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,559
so as i was discussing in pim uh working

426
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,039
group

427
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,280
one of the things which can be done to

428
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,799
achieve a stickiness in the pim

429
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,520
is so right now if we think the dr

430
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,080
election procedure is actually

431
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
between uh two things two parameters one

432
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
is your dr priority

433
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,039
and then second is pimp neighbor ip

434
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,559
address

435
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,080
so let's let's consider this case that

436
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,799
we have four routers on the line and

437
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,840
each router

438
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,000
their priority is 100 200 300 and 400

439
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,600
so when dr election happens router 4

440
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
will get elected as a

441
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,320
pmdr but as i said

442
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,360
if router 5 comes with priority 500

443
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,919
that may end up taking dr role and it

444
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,480
will

445
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,039
it has to go through all the tree

446
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,640
building procedure and

447
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
then 4 will start pruning its own tree

448
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,679
and

449
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
five will take over so if we want to

450
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,720
achieve

451
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,840
stickiness we can utilize this

452
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,559
characteristic where dr priority is the

453
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,400
one who is actually driving the whole dr

454
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,600
election

455
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,039
so can we make sure no matter what

456
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,240
which router comes in the network

457
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,600
four doesn't give away its dr dr road

458
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,719
yeah we can go to next slide

459
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,080
so to use this functionality

460
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
the simplest way was that we have to

461
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,200
have a way

462
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
where even though router 4 has been

463
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,320
configured with

464
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,280
priority 400 we have to make sure that

465
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,960
the rest of the

466
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,840
router and the lan they consider that

467
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,640
nobody can

468
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
have higher priority

469
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
than router 4 so for that the mechanism

470
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
which

471
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,840
which i was discussing even in the

472
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
working group mailing list

473
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,320
is let's reserve the highest

474
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,080
dr priority highest highest possibility

475
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
or priority

476
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,159
on the land and if we reserve it is

477
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,679
something similar to you can say

478
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,360
mutex that once four has been elected as

479
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,320
a dr

480
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
so the original dr election will happen

481
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,679
depending

482
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,880
on what was the actual configured vr

483
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,760
priority

484
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,919
once that has been done router 4 will

485
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,400
get

486
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
our router 4 will get the max dr

487
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,159
priority

488
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,039
and it will start advertising its

489
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,080
priority as a

490
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,120
max value so and we consider

491
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,000
the reason for reserving that number is

492
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,799
to make sure

493
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,480
that no one configures that manually

494
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
otherwise it will end up going into the

495
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,559
ip address selection and ip address

496
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,159
cannot be controlled

497
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,159
it can go either side and stickiness

498
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,520
will not be present anymore

499
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,840
so so router 4 gets the

500
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,960
it will get assigned the max dr priority

501
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
and it will advertise

502
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,320
the max max dr now what is the benefit

503
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,159
of this mechanism

504
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,480
now if you see from router 1 2 and 3

505
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,200
point of view

506
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,480
they started getting router 4 dr

507
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,440
priority as a max so no matter what they

508
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,120
are never going to take over

509
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,760
as a dr so now even if a router comes

510
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,480
with

511
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,760
priority 500 when out of

512
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,559
router 5 comes into the network and it

513
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,960
starts advertising its own

514
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
dr priority as a 500 since there is a

515
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,320
router 4 who is already advertising max

516
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
value it is never going to take

517
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
so we will maintain the stickiness

518
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,520
feature

519
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,120
now what would happen if this router

520
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,039
goes down router 4 itself goes down

521
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,120
as soon as router 4 goes down we are

522
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,159
back to exact same way where we started

523
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,919
so where router 1 2 and 3 are in the lan

524
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,120
now dr priority is 100 200 and 300

525
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,400
and since their router their priorities

526
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
are already configured there will be dr

527
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,679
election

528
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,919
and as soon as dr election happens the

529
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,799
router 3 will

530
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,919
start advertising its

531
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,840
dr priority as a max and same thing

532
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,279
continues

533
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
other benefits are let's say that out of

534
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,480
4 router

535
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,159
router 4 doesn't support this

536
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,520
specification

537
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
so if router 4 doesn't support this

538
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
specification we cannot achieve

539
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
stickiness but even in that case it is

540
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,520
not going to break any functionality in

541
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,200
router 1 2 and 3

542
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,640
because the router four will get

543
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
connected as uh dr

544
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,679
dr on the land so even since it doesn't

545
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,720
support

546
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
this new function new specification it

547
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,520
will keep announcing itself as a router

548
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,240
400

549
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
oh sorry dr priority 400 so it will

550
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,400
be acting as a dr till someone else

551
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
takes over

552
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
so the nothing nothing changes with

553
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
respect to or

554
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,279
i would say with respect to backward

555
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,720
compatibility there is

556
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,000
no problem here so we can go to the next

557
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,440
so the reason why uh i was in favor of

558
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,240
reserving max dr priority it is

559
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,120
it is for the simple fact that we don't

560
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,840
want

561
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,960
accidentally these numbers to be open to

562
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,559
be configured because

563
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,200
if i am using let's say that max dr

564
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,360
possible priority is 100

565
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,480
and i am using system to assign a

566
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
priority 100 to whoever is the dr at

567
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,080
that point of time

568
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,440
if user also assigns a priority as 100

569
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
on the land what it is going to happen

570
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,240
that it says

571
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,960
router who

572
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
address so that will create a chart okay

573
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,200
next

574
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,200
so adjusting uh asset matrix so if you

575
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
see here

576
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,159
even though dr does play a role for uh

577
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,039
sending traffic on the land but if

578
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,720
assert comes into the picture it will be

579
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,120
assert winner who is going to

580
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,440
who is going to start forwarding traffic

581
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,640
on the land

582
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,080
so one of the idea here was to

583
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,320
okay can we do something to make sure

584
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,120
that

585
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,840
dr will always be assert winner as well

586
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
and that is where

587
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,960
this solution came into the mind that

588
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,120
maybe assert metric should also be

589
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,559
adjusted to

590
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,679
infinite similar to what we did for dr

591
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,679
priority that whoever was whoever had

592
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,520
been elected as a dr

593
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,880
will always be a vr excerpt winner as

594
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
well

595
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,080
and do we have next slide

596
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,039
so i think next slide speaks about

597
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,320
implementation of

598
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
stickiness behavior

599
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,279
yeah so we do have implementation for

600
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,000
this behavior what i have described in

601
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,039
last

602
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,240
couple of slides about stickiness and if

603
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,720
when i did google maybe someone can

604
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,080
confirm but i think

605
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,679
there are other vendors who also do

606
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,000
have implementation almost in same lines

607
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,279
though

608
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,640
numbers have been not reserved yet and

609
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,200
uh it is just that the same same

610
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,559
mechanism implementation does exist

611
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,960
and one more thing to discuss here so

612
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,760
initially

613
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,200
i think i presented

614
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,840
uh yeah i just wanna say that uh when we

615
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,080
worked on on young models

616
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
uh we were checking what different

617
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,360
vendors were doing what kind of

618
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,159
configuration

619
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,440
they supported and i think there were

620
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
at least three or four different vendors

621
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,000
that supported something like this

622
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,120
uh either i'm not quite sure know if it

623
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
was stickiness or if it was

624
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,840
just the first part which is the delay

625
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,919
uh when you change to your actual year

626
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,840
priority but at least there were

627
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,200
two vendors doing something someone yeah

628
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
something along with mine

629
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,279
so i did yesterday since i get email uh

630
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,120
i think from uh

631
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,320
juniper attaching ipr for

632
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,200
this draft so when i read about that ipr

633
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,000
it talks

634
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,919
about basically the way stickiness is

635
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,480
achieved

636
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,360
is i think just not doing vr election

637
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,480
anymore

638
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,520
or some some kind of timer related

639
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,840
but i did when i did google maybe human

640
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,799
can confirm

641
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,440
i think and i i have discussed this with

642
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,240
woman and

643
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,799
jeffrey both and i think juniper and

644
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,320
nokia both have almost similar

645
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,919
implementation with respect to

646
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
stickiness

647
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,880
so and just to add one more thing that

648
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,039
initially when

649
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,799
i had presented this there was a

650
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,360
comment saying that we want to make this

651
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,600
as informational because it was not

652
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,080
defining anything or it was not

653
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,159
reserving anything and registering

654
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,880
but now i think it would be up to chairs

655
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
and ad

656
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,760
and other members in the working group

657
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,320
that if we plan to reserve

658
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,440
some of the dr priority

659
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,799
towards towards max so where does draft

660
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,080
stand will it be still

661
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,159
informational or it goes to experimental

662
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,120
or it goes to

663
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,880
standard so that's all i had

664
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,520
go ahead lenny

665
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,039
um yeah so this this concept of uh

666
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,399
priority and preemption

667
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,640
it's it's not unique to pim uh it seems

668
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,919
like it's been solved in you know a

669
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,760
number of other protocols um

670
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,520
things like our uh vrp and uh

671
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,840
uh rsvp with backup paths

672
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,000
can we leverage some of i mean what has

673
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
been done i guess

674
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,520
one thing i think to be worth looking at

675
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,640
is you know

676
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,159
in the case of erp and say rsvp um

677
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,679
was it you know uh a protocol level

678
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,039
stuff or were these just um vendor

679
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,240
implementations

680
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,960
that made that um and i think those

681
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
could be good

[Music]

683
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
precedence good good examples to look at

684
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,399
you know how to solve this problem

685
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,440
whether it's worth doing it in the

686
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,480
protocol

687
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,720
or it's worth uh you know just making it

688
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
informational and

689
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,600
you know leaving it up to vendors um

690
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,520
leaving up the implementations

691
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,440
um but you know this this doesn't seem

692
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,360
unique at all to pim it's a pretty

693
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,799
common thing that happens in lots of

694
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,360
protocols

695
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,720
yes elro

696
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,440
hey um i'll go to the thunderbolt 80. so

697
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,480
what has me

698
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,559
very confused is

699
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,840
the fact that um

700
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,120
we're talking about two solutions that

701
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,679
basically do the same thing

702
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,360
um mankind just made a really good

703
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,279
argument in my opinion as to why the

704
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,760
other solution is not needed

705
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,039
because we can do the same thing without

706
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,679
signaling it looks like

707
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,120
but of course this draft hasn't been

708
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,559
approved hasn't been adopted

709
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,240
um and in general

710
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
you know whether it's informational

711
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,600
standard doesn't matter

712
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
if the working group is going to work on

713
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,279
several solutions or several related

714
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,320
solutions

715
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
even for example the the load balancing

716
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,559
draft for the dr's

717
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,399
it would be really nice if they were all

718
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,000
considered you know how do they interact

719
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,679
what happens if one is working on the

720
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,200
other one i said what happens if one guy

721
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,480
thinks it's doing this and the other guy

722
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,919
is doing something else

723
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,919
um you know thinks along those lines

724
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,159
regardless again of the status

725
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,799
um so what confuses me is that again we

726
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,720
we seem to be

727
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,600
um circling around there seems to be

728
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,120
several implementations of

729
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
this or something very similar to this

730
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320
draft

731
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,760
if i remember correctly there's at least

732
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,360
one implementation of the dr

733
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,559
improvement draft as well so

734
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,480
i think we sort of need to resolve that

735
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,000
right do we want to do one solution two

736
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,960
solutions

737
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,559
um you know etc as long as as

738
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,480
we have consensus on that as long as we

739
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,760
understand

740
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,960
how they can either interact together or

741
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,320
or not right and that is clearly defined

742
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,360
in the specifications um

743
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,479
you know it would make it a lot clearer

744
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,000
uh i agree alvaro so initially we only

745
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,720
had

746
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
one solution for sticky dr which was in

747
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,760
that other draft

748
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,559
but now we have basically two proposals

749
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,000
for how to do this

750
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,039
so we need to see what are their pros

751
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,760
and cons right and do we need do we

752
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,279
actually need two solutions

753
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,159
or should we pick the one solution that

754
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:32,960
we think is

755
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,159
is best or are there different use cases

756
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,279
so that you know one

757
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,200
one solution is best in one scenario

758
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,039
while in other scenarios maybe the other

759
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:41,440
one

760
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,799
so we need to um look carefully i think

761
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,640
at both these solutions and see what

762
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,679
their working group

763
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,640
would like us to do

764
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,240
and it sounds like alvaro just to be

765
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,799
clear i um

766
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,200
i'm not either advocating for one or two

767
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,840
right

768
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,000
i i want the working group to decide

769
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
that

770
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,720
and if we're going to go with more than

771
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,880
one we just need to

772
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,760
make sure that we consider how they

773
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,799
interact or not

774
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,440
and that if there are multiple use cases

775
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,159
maybe

776
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,440
we uh define that in drafts you know for

777
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,640
this use case it's better to use

778
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,440
solution one

779
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,760
and for that other use case uh maybe

780
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,919
solution two is better right

781
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,240
but but it seems you know still the dr

782
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,480
for example the vr improvement draft

783
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
still the latest version says that it

784
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,760
should

785
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,080
normative uh back to this document

786
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,440
if the other solution is not um

787
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,919
it's not supported but of course there's

788
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,679
a way to know if i support this draft

789
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,360
because there's no signaling

790
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,679
um unless you know there's configuration

791
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:48,880
assumed and you have a bunch of other

792
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,600
stuff

793
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,559
so there needs to be you know more

794
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,080
coordination

795
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,440
now i said you know my personal opinion

796
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,519
is that uh my camaraderie just made a

797
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,320
really good

798
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,840
argument for why we only need this one

799
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,039
but really so

800
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,679
yeah so if the working group decides you

801
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,399
know that

802
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,199
we that we only need one solution that

803
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:11,760
covers

804
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,119
all the use cases then um yeah we

805
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
probably want to publish only one of the

806
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,480
documents at least that's

807
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,320
my feeling but we need to have that

808
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,199
discussion

809
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,280
and i wouldn't rule out at this point

810
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,800
that we possibly could have two

811
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,079
documents it depends

812
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,200
what we decide

813
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,000
yeah because some people may want to

814
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,320
have a solution that does

815
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,239
uh have a new hello option and maybe

816
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,719
some don't want to do that it seems

817
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,719
to me that having two solutions is okay

818
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,679
i mean it's

819
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,560
something that we may want to do but we

820
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
right now only have one working group

821
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,199
document so we have to make that

822
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,040
decision first whether we want to adopt

823
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,960
this one or not but albro

824
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,839
um it sounds like what you're saying and

825
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,599
what you said on the list is that um

826
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,440
let's say that we do adopt this

827
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,640
this draft that we're talking about

828
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,680
right now you would prefer

829
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,599
uh that both this and the dr improvement

830
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,200
progress together like we should hold

831
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,440
off on

832
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,200
progressing vr improvement until this

833
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
one is also to a state where it should

834
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,280
progress is that correct

835
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,560
uh you know that would be very nice um

836
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,000
they're not dependent on each other

837
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,280
right so i don't need one for the other

838
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,720
one to work right

839
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,000
um so they don't have to progress

840
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,720
together it would be very nice so that

841
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,000
when you tell me for example

842
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
if i don't support your improvement then

843
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,240
do this

844
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,960
then you know i can i can look how this

845
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,160
works

846
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,599
uh so it'd be really nice if they were

847
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,200
close they don't have to be together

848
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,920
okay i mean right now it's it's a really

849
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,480
weird

850
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,640
situation because we're in the dr

851
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,680
improvement draft

852
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,000
we are normatively recommending the use

853
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,520
of a non-adopted document which

854
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,800
you know in the grand scheme of things

855
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,880
is not a bad thing it's just that it

856
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,520
would be

857
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,599
just nicer if things have progressed a

858
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,000
lot more

859
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,720
so i i agree with that um

860
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,800
and we can't really i mean we shouldn't

861
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
really progress any document until we

862
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,040
decide whether we really want

863
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
to have two solutions or not or until we

864
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,920
have carefully considered which solution

865
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,720
we actually think

866
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,200
is best

867
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,480
or as i said it's possible we decide

868
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,400
that we actually want both solutions but

869
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,800
at least we need to

870
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,839
agree on that first

871
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,000
should we uh like people

872
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,320
but otherwise we i think we need to have

873
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,640
a good discussion on the mailing list

874
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,920
where we compare the two options and

875
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,599
figure out yeah what are the differences

876
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,320
um which one is doing it this way and

877
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
which is the other way which

878
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,040
was working best or or

879
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,280
under which scenarios is one solution

880
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,480
working better than the other

881
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,520
scenario and so on

882
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,079
i'm just going to go ahead and start a

883
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,680
quick

884
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,520
poll just to see because montgomery

885
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,800
didn't make the request that we

886
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,480
pull for adoption so why don't we

887
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,599
do that and then

888
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,040
like you said stig will take it to the

889
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,280
list yeah so

890
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,359
even if we adopt both documents it

891
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,359
doesn't mean that we have to publish

892
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,880
both documents that's something that

893
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,520
will

894
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,839
decide later on

895
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,920
can people see the results right now

896
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,240
like what i'm seeing like

897
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,640
can you guys like right now i see four

898
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,839
people

899
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,880
yeah i see it's here so five hours

900
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
okay

901
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,720
does everyone know where to go look yeah

902
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:01,839
right there's a little number

903
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,079
so the poll currently is six in favor

904
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,480
and

905
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,800
two against so and now seven in favor

906
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,640
so um we'll let this run for a little

907
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,280
bit longer um

908
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,000
but we do need to take it to the list

909
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,480
and

910
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,839
we'll need to make it as simple as we

911
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,200
can when we make the requests in the

912
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,240
list and just

913
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
focus specifically on this draft and

914
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,680
then you're right

915
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,240
stink we can

916
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,280
them both and if we decide to

917
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,320
discontinue on we'll do it or combine

918
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:48,560
them

919
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
damn you're letting eleven people know

920
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,160
one thing that's really good

921
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,760
mine too

922
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
so it's look good here but yeah of

923
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,760
course we have to take it to the list

924
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,520
and um

925
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,480
also want to hear what concerns people

926
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,680
have why they are

927
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,800
wanting not to adopt and also what

928
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,920
makes people like this and want to adopt

929
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,000
it

930
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,480
okay so i'm going to end it we have nine

931
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,079
in favor two against and let's

932
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,440
get any other questions

933
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,839
are we good

934
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,960
okay i can't hear you but i guess we're

935
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,839
good

936
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,839
you guys still there

937
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
yeah i'm bringing up the next slides

938
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,839
here

939
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,359
are you there uh yes uh

940
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,160
stick can you hear me go ahead just tell

941
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
me when to proceed to the next slide

942
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,280
yeah yeah yeah so uh yeah thanks

943
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,240
uh to mike and stick for taking this a

944
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,680
little bit early in the agenda

945
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,560
uh i have some chronic back pain so i

946
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,359
couldn't

947
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,560
wait a lot longer

948
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,119
so thank you for taking it earlier next

949
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,599
slide please

950
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,160
so um the proposal is to kind of

951
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,680
build on the 8059 rfc

952
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,880
to request new joint prone attributes

953
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,240
for

954
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,800
a lisp multi-site scenario uh so i'll

955
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,319
just briefly go over the problem

956
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,119
statement and then kind of explain the

957
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,119
motivation for requesting the new tlv

958
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,160
and then

959
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,319
we can of course take questions so

960
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,160
the multi-site scenario for lisp

961
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,839
multicast has been covered in 6831

962
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,319
where multicast asm ssm and binder modes

963
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,079
are supported in the overlay

964
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,720
with an ip multicast based underlay so

965
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,319
the key point here is that we're using

966
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,160
ip multicast both in the overlay and in

967
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,280
the underlay

968
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
and just for simplicity sake we will

969
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,440
just take ssm in the overlay and ssm in

970
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,960
the underlay but without loss of

971
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,079
generality

972
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,079
this should apply for all three modes in

973
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,079
the overlay but for this purpose

974
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,520
or just for explaining the problem

975
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,920
statement i will just stick to ssm in

976
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,720
the overlay and ssm in the underlay

977
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,359
the key point to note here is that you

978
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,440
have

979
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,240
m overlay might be multicast groups

980
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,560
spread across multiple vrfs

981
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,280
mapped to young underlay transport

982
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,560
multicast groups

983
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,400
where m is much greater than n

984
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,240
so the problem gets compounded for

985
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,400
multi-site scenarios we will discuss

986
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,079
that particular scenario using the next

987
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,319
slide but this is already being covered

988
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,680
in section eight one two of

989
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,119
sixty eight thirty one section eight one

990
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,880
two of sixty eight thirty one already

991
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,040
notes that when you have such a scenario

992
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
where you have a m2n mapping very m

993
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,119
much greater than n you could have

994
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,400
traffic going to

995
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,599
undesired locations now the goal of our

996
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,880
proposal is not to you know optimize

997
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,480
or rather reduce the traffic going to

998
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,960
undesired locations but also fix

999
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,440
uh scenarios that were related to

1000
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,560
traffic happening

1001
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,040
so the proposal we have given may not

1002
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,079
completely take away the uh

1003
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,880
traffic being you know sent to under

1004
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,560
unrequited locations and then getting

1005
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,440
dropped

1006
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,960
but definitely it should avoid traffic

1007
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,800
looping scenarios that we didn't observe

1008
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,119
in a particular implementation

1009
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,240
with such characteristics the focus of

1010
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:24,640
this

1011
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,520
proposal is predominantly focused on the

1012
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,960
border nodes

1013
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,560
so the protocol exchanges that we

1014
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,839
suggest are predominantly between the

1015
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,520
border nodes but then they can be

1016
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,319
between you know xtr's inside a lisp

1017
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,760
site also

1018
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
but for the purpose of this presentation

1019
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,680
i will just limit my

1020
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,480
explanation to the border nodes and you

1021
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,240
know how the multicast tree gets formed

1022
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,760
at the border nodes and

1023
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,040
why we require this new tlv next slide

1024
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,359
please

1025
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,560
so yeah so if you just consider a lisp

1026
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,839
multi-site scenario

1027
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,240
that is shown in the picture you know

1028
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,920
the tree rooted at

1029
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,200
xtr 1.1 the source connected to xtr 1.1

1030
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,760
and then there are receivers you know at

1031
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,800
every site

1032
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,079
there could be receivers in the border

1033
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,240
nodes also so

1034
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,880
the way the ssm join would flow is

1035
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,640
basically the receiver connected to

1036
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,400
for example xtr 31 the igmp join goes to

1037
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,440
xtr 31 and then the xtr 31 figures out

1038
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,000
that

1039
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
in order to reach the source in site one

1040
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,240
the blue site i have to get to border

1041
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,240
the site border because it's a slight

1042
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,440
external

1043
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,240
prefix therefore it forwards the pim

1044
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,960
join

1045
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,800
in the overlay to the border b3

1046
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,400
for the you know source the multicast

1047
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:44,880
source

1048
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,480
that is the camera in site one

1049
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,760
also maps that traffic to a underlay

1050
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,240
tree

1051
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
rooted at border three because for the

1052
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,720
xtr three one

1053
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,960
it it appears the traffic originates

1054
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,800
from v3 the b3 is the

1055
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,400
ingress itr right the b3

1056
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,640
gets both the overlay join and the

1057
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,760
underly join

1058
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,079
the underlay tree rooted at b3 and then

1059
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,119
the overlay tree

1060
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,079
that is rooted for the cameras eid

1061
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,680
prefix

1062
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,000
and the camera group and then figures

1063
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,880
out that

1064
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,920
the camera eid prefix is actually

1065
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,640
reachable via b1 and therefore forwards

1066
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,599
a join in the

1067
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,760
overlay to the b1

1068
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,839
encapsulated using the lisp this is

1069
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,880
again specified in 6831 nothing new

1070
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,079
and then forwards an underlay join by

1071
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,400
mapping the overlay group to an underlay

1072
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,720
group to the tree rooted at b1

1073
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,240
so in both the steps we have

1074
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,000
from xtr 31 to b3 and from b3 to b1

1075
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,839
we have two joints going one in the

1076
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,839
overlay and one in the underlay

1077
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,880
and the process repeats at b1 where b1

1078
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,560
figures out that in order to reach the

1079
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,119
camera i have to reach the xtr 1 1

1080
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,200
and forwards the overlay joint to the

1081
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,680
xtr11 using the unicast clip

1082
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,880
encapsulation

1083
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,920
and also joins the tree rooted at xtr

1084
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,920
one one in the underlay so the underlay

1085
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,359
i mean the overlay traffic can be mapped

1086
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:16,960
to the underlying stream

1087
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,160
now this is fine for the unidirectional

1088
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,880
traffic

1089
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,440
now i have not shown here you know

1090
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,359
bi-directional traffic but

1091
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,520
one could easily imagine that if there

1092
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,200
is a source

1093
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,359
connected to str31 and receiver

1094
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,280
connected to xtr one one

1095
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,839
then the same process what i just

1096
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:36,480
described

1097
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,720
repeats in the opposite direction but

1098
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,839
what could happen

1099
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,599
in this process is that the same tree

1100
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,559
that is rooted at b1 for the underlay

1101
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,880
for the traffic coming from

1102
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,000
ah you know xtr one one could

1103
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,720
also be used inside the lisp site blue

1104
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,839
site

1105
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,559
for the traffic that xtr11 pulls from

1106
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,680
you know xtr 31 by b3 and b1 so i will

1107
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,920
just repeat my last point

1108
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,280
the central tree that is rooted

1109
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,200
at b1 which b3 is part of

1110
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,520
for the flow that is coming from xtr one

1111
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,359
one to three one

1112
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,480
could also be used for the

1113
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,839
traffic that is flowing from xtr 31

1114
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,960
to say the receiver in xtr one two so

1115
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,240
therefore

1116
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,520
the traffic happening basically

1117
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,200
whatever traffic that was sent from

1118
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,880
xtr11 to b1

1119
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,240
to go to b3 a copy of that packet

1120
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,720
goes to xjr12 and therefore duplicate

1121
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,079
packets get received or

1122
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,680
you know even traffic looping scenarios

1123
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,160
happen in the case of

1124
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,720
bi-directional traffic between two

1125
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,680
different

1126
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,359
uh you know lisp sites exchanging

1127
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,599
bi-directional multicast traffic now

1128
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,040
therefore if you just go to the last

1129
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
bullet of the previous slide

1130
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,640
stick the complexity or the problem

1131
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,920
arises because

1132
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,280
the previous slide is like two

1133
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,760
you know the complexity arrives is

1134
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,760
because the border nodes perform a

1135
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,200
special role

1136
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,839
in participating in three pim domains

1137
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:18,720
two in the

1138
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,119
underlay and one in the overlay now the

1139
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,960
reason why i say two pim domains in the

1140
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,680
underlay

1141
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,880
is that sorry stick you may have to come

1142
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,599
back to

1143
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,839
the diagram the two in the underlay

1144
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:33,119
essentially is one is the side facing

1145
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:35,200
under liping domain and then one is the

1146
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,960
core facing under lipid domain and then

1147
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,880
you have the over lipid domain

1148
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,880
so in order to kind of you know

1149
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,240
break this uh looping or you know

1150
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,119
a duplicate traffic being received uh

1151
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,960
the obvious solution is to use a split

1152
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,400
horizon

1153
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,880
and that's what the tlv proposal is but

1154
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,880
i will pass at this point of time

1155
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,640
and take any questions and then try to

1156
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,480
clarify because i think clarifying the

1157
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,920
problem statement here

1158
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,640
probably definitely requires additional

1159
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:13,839
explanation

1160
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,119
ah

1161
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,990
do i take silence to

1162
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,400
[Music]

1163
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,760
just keep going okay okay

1164
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,200
okay so um

1165
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,880
so these when we thought about the

1166
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,400
solution i think uh

1167
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
one of the uh key tenets that we thought

1168
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,800
was or rather one of the key proposals

1169
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,079
that we thought was let's

1170
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,680
try to use a split horizon approach

1171
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,760
where instead of using the

1172
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,119
same tree for the you know intra site

1173
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,960
traffic and the intersect traffic let's

1174
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,160
try to you know partition the address

1175
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,520
space and use

1176
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,160
different ranges one for the you know

1177
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,440
site local traffic

1178
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,760
and one for the you know intersect

1179
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,720
traffic and

1180
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,760
that way we could achieve uh

1181
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,880
you know the split horizon so

1182
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,200
uh the one of the ways we could achieve

1183
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,400
the split horizon

1184
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,599
is by having the downstream border

1185
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,839
in this case you know for the traffic

1186
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,640
direction

1187
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,480
b1 to b3 let b3 request

1188
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,520
to b1 when the overlay joint happens

1189
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,880
you know let b3 convey the or signal the

1190
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,559
uh overlay to underlay mapping

1191
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,079
explicitly uh

1192
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,520
and thereby you know you can

1193
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,079
you know do the split horizon and kind

1194
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,400
of achieve the

1195
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,640
partitioning that you wanted to achieve

1196
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:51,839
now of course this comes

1197
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,000
am i audible

1198
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,920
hello prasad we lost you for a while

1199
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,079
oh okay what was the last sentence i can

1200
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,400
repeat

1201
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,359
no idea just go

1202
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,960
okay about 20 seconds

1203
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,920
okay okay so so i was just trying to

1204
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,599
explain that you know the the on

1205
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,839
the downstream router can use a

1206
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,119
signaling mechanism

1207
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,079
uh to map the to conveys you know uh

1208
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:26,960
interest

1209
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,760
uh by conveying the mapping that it

1210
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:30,559
wants to do

1211
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,640
use for the overlay to underlay using a

1212
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,559
new tlv and that's the new proposal

1213
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,119
that we are making where you know b3

1214
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,800
essentially signals to b1

1215
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,280
for the overlay group uh you know for

1216
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,960
the overlay group camera group in this

1217
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,520
case

1218
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,880
for the camera source please use a given

1219
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,839
underlay group that

1220
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,078
you know

1221
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,400
yeah maybe again

1222
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,800
yeah thinking maybe not everyone here is

1223
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,960
knows maybe the least multicast solution

1224
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,160
the other rfc that well but

1225
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,440
but at least the main thing is um

1226
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,280
in that solution there's already pim

1227
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,800
joints being sent in the overlay

1228
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,839
and and we have existing attribute

1229
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,440
from the information today but

1230
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,240
what is missing is is conveying this

1231
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,359
particular

1232
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,119
information about the overlay group

1233
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,520
right all right so uh

1234
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,880
the the last slide stick

1235
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,880
basically or the next slide not the last

1236
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,720
one the fourth one

1237
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,280
so basically the proposal is to have a

1238
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,640
tlv that signals the

1239
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,839
overlay to underlay mapping

1240
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,319
where the join the pim joint prune

1241
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,000
attribute will be enhanced to include a

1242
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:54,559
new

1243
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,119
underlay multicast group very similar to

1244
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,280
what has been proposed in 1859 for the

1245
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,960
ingress replication case

1246
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,520
where the same tlv format is used

1247
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,599
instead of the multicast group it was a

1248
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,400
unicast group now we did look at 8059

1249
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:08,720
and

1250
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,640
and check whether the existing tlv can

1251
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,040
be used for both unicast and multicast

1252
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,319
addresses but i think the

1253
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:17,040
the 8059 tlb i think i'm talking about

1254
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,280
tlv type 6 specifically the rlock

1255
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,280
address tlv specifically says that it

1256
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,800
has to be a unicast address

1257
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,559
and therefore we kind of proposed a new

1258
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:25,920
tlb or rather

1259
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,200
you know we're thinking of proposing a

1260
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,760
new tlv which

1261
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,680
signals the multicast address and not

1262
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:39,839
the unicast address

1263
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,640
and the last slide stick please the next

1264
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,319
steps

1265
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,000
would be to get more comments on the

1266
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,760
draft and then

1267
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,319
ask for adoption at some point of time

1268
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,680
yeah at least at least i feel that it's

1269
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,880
it's better to have a new attribute for

1270
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,640
this instead of trying to overload the

1271
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,880
existing one with a kind of slightly

1272
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,359
different

1273
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,839
meaning

1274
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,359
go ahead easy i i

1275
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:18,079
i have to admit i'm uh sort of took a

1276
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,720
break from him for a number of years

1277
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,319
uh did did what's the relation with the

1278
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,000
lisp solution and the list book

1279
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,720
this is the question about presenting

1280
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,759
this draft at the list

1281
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,760
yes yes is is this and where it should

1282
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,520
be progressed should it be progressed

1283
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,440
definitely be progressed here i mean

1284
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,119
there's an interaction here it's sort of

1285
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,000
like

1286
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,400
i guess it's it's somewhat like uh

1287
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,440
m evp and

1288
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,640
m vpn in a way you know you can kind of

1289
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,680
look at it like that

1290
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,760
and an mvpn best owns that

1291
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,559
so if you took that same methodology

1292
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:07,200
this

1293
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,960
update would be owned by i mean you took

1294
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,480
that same example

1295
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,520
this would be owned by this but not pam

1296
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,720
uh good question uh is a two two parts

1297
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,240
to answer to your question right

1298
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,760
should this be presented at list

1299
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,079
absolutely yes uh probably at the next

1300
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:22,799
ietf

1301
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,119
uh i will present this to lisp working

1302
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:25,920
group uh

1303
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,240
yes but should it be progressed in list

1304
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,040
per time

1305
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,960
uh correct me if i'm wrong uh sticker

1306
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,119
mic the 8059rfc

1307
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,880
uh where the previous types have been

1308
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,799
defined have been progressed in pim and

1309
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,000
therefore i submitted

1310
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,240
it to pim because the type that i am

1311
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,079
proposing is very similar to the type

1312
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,920
that has already been requested for the

1313
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,200
unicast address and

1314
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,240
that was done in pim

1315
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,000
yeah that makes sense to me however i'm

1316
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,760
looking at the lisp

1317
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,520
charter right now they do have a section

1318
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,160
on multicast that does say that

1319
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,280
they do support uh overlay multicast by

1320
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,040
means of replication blah blah blah

1321
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,799
and it may need this it may need

1322
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,160
discussion with other working groups

1323
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,920
related to multicast

1324
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,480
including pin they call out pins so we

1325
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,160
definitely would need to coordinate with

1326
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,680
them

1327
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,760
because it sounds like they would almost

1328
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,200
want to work on it themselves but i'm

1329
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,680
not sure

1330
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,599
go ahead albro hey uh

1331
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,400
anything yes so i think the difference

1332
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,680
uh between this

1333
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,920
and um say mvpn for example is

1334
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,079
at least the details in the draft about

1335
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,760
what to do with everything

1336
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,240
right a vpn is you know a countless

1337
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,680
number of pages

1338
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,920
uh this is a very short draft which

1339
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,520
seems to mostly focus

1340
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,880
on requesting the new type right

1341
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,359
so you said mike what needs to happen

1342
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:48,640
right which is

1343
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,400
um you're coordinated with lisp make

1344
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,720
sure that list wants this

1345
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,559
and if um you know we need to add a lot

1346
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,040
more

1347
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,400
details um according to what ac said

1348
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:00,880
which

1349
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,280
makes sense then uh you know we need to

1350
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,880
just coordinate with list chairs

1351
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,359
on um you know what are the other

1352
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,040
details what these happen

1353
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,280
and if they want it and we can give them

1354
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,480
a type then you know it's okay to

1355
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,920
process it here and that's all the

1356
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,000
drafts are going to say

1357
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,960
but yeah talk to uh joel and uh luigi

1358
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,200
about this

1359
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,520
that's exactly what happened last time

1360
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,319
um

1361
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:26,559
the main work was not in pim but it was

1362
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,240
presented and discussed in the list

1363
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,079
working group as well to make sure that

1364
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,440
they actually

1365
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,720
thought it was a good idea

1366
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,200
sandy has a question of uh prasad about

1367
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,480
is this the extension that you just

1368
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,680
presented for the

1369
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,920
star g uh or sg or for both of them

1370
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,640
yeah uh yes uh thanks for bringing it up

1371
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,000
mike uh it is for both

1372
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,920
uh sandy uh when the strategy so the tlv

1373
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,559
proposal that can be added stick can you

1374
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,680
go to slide number four please

1375
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,680
yeah so the proposed tlv if you look at

1376
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,359
the last bullet it can be either

1377
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,720
appended to the joint

1378
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,559
group address encoded group format or

1379
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,839
the giant source address

1380
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,520
encoded source format so you can use it

1381
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:19,839
for both

1382
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,920
okay that made sense to her so um any

1383
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:33,839
other questions

1384
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,880
so precise do you want us to reach out

1385
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,200
to

1386
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,240
um joel and the other list chairs or do

1387
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,640
you want to do it

1388
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,680
what do you prefer um

1389
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,119
either way is fine i don't have a

1390
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,720
preference uh

1391
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,920
mike uh yeah it's okay if you

1392
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,480
can start it and i'll just chime in

1393
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,920
later

1394
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,319
okay we'll probably just do that then

1395
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,599
and copy you we've done the same thing

1396
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,760
with other working groups so

1397
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,359
um great thank you appreciate your time

1398
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,079
so just a quick note uh list didn't meet

1399
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,440
this week

1400
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,240
but they're going to plan an interim

1401
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,240
soon after the atf

1402
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,240
so since you haven't presented this

1403
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,280
there

1404
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,799
it would be good to present to there

1405
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,000
right before deciding what to do with

1406
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,480
the draft

1407
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,480
okay okay alvaro uh i think it was

1408
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,920
alvaro yes alvaro i'll

1409
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,440
try to see if we can get it presented at

1410
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,280
the interim thanks

1411
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,839
um yeah thank you thank you mike and

1412
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:43,839
stick again

1413
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,839
mom you're next

1414
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,520
uh just making sure you guys hear me

1415
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,559
uh yeah hear you all right perfect

1416
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,400
i got so many microphones in front of me

1417
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,680
i don't know which one is which anymore

1418
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,960
i just turn them all out

1419
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,359
and one of them just picks me up um

1420
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:07,599
okay so this is the update for point to

1421
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,440
multipoint policy to give you guys a

1422
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,319
little bit of

1423
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,480
overview where we are with some of the

1424
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,240
drafts out there

1425
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,640
um obviously the replication segment was

1426
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,079
adopted by a spring

1427
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,319
uh the point to multiply policy

1428
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,799
obviously by pim thank you

1429
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,160
the mvpn evpn extensions

1430
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,680
by bess was adopted uh we are working

1431
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,839
very hard uh on the pce draft

1432
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,480
and trying to make it adopted in the pce

1433
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,520
working group

1434
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,319
there is a little bit of discussions

1435
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:42,000
back and forth on how

1436
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,880
these objects should be presented and

1437
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,760
downloaded from the pce to the pcc

1438
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,119
we are hoping we're going to have a

1439
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,520
resolution to that by the next ietf and

1440
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,480
we can adopt

1441
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,680
that draft as well so we have a way of

1442
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,359
downloading the replication segments

1443
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,839
from the pce to the pcc

1444
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,960
after that the work will go into the idr

1445
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,480
for the bgp point to multi-point policy

1446
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,720
another way southbound direction to

1447
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,319
download these

1448
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,559
replication segments to the network to

1449
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:13,920
the pccs

1450
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,520
and last but not least is the ping

1451
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,640
which we are working with some folks and

1452
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,079
we are hoping we're going to have a

1453
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,280
solid draft by next itf and we're going

1454
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,839
to present it here with np

1455
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,520
one sorry my apologies guy

1456
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,440
sorry go ahead i'm sorry when you're

1457
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,280
done i'll chime in

1458
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,400
okay sure thank you uh so so one last

1459
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,119
uh question that is still remaining i'm

1460
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:42,799
not sure what was the outcome of it was

1461
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,160
the yang

1462
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,359
um i don't know it's it's sitting in a

1463
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,000
spring

1464
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,680
i i don't know whether we wanted to

1465
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,839
bring it into the pimp or not

1466
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:54,960
uh i don't know that's what i was gonna

1467
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,400
that's what i was gonna come up comment

1468
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,240
on yeah great so

1469
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,319
um stig may remember this as well you

1470
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:01,359
may too but

1471
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:04,319
so last summer i think it was we did

1472
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,240
discuss this with the spring chairs

1473
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,359
and they said that they wanted to keep

1474
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:10,319
that in spring

1475
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,920
um unless you broke this up into two

1476
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,200
yang documents one

1477
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,440
for the ptmp policy and one for

1478
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,880
replication segment

1479
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,640
one would be here and one would be there

1480
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,160
so um that would be your choice it would

1481
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,440
be a lot a lot of work

1482
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,880
but we're certainly open to

1483
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,119
uh consider adoption in this working

1484
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,520
group if it's just focused on

1485
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,200
the policy part okay understood

1486
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,760
uh yeah so let me have a conversation

1487
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,400
with the

1488
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,480
with the co-authors and we'll take it

1489
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,160
from there thank you

1490
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,680
next slide please

1491
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,520
so while you guys are reading this i

1492
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,280
just want to do a little bit of refresh

1493
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,119
what was the replication segment was all

1494
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,119
about so if you folks remember a

1495
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:54,400
replication segment

1496
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,599
is is a seat it can be presented

1497
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,280
via any form mpls is one of the ways

1498
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:01,760
that we are

1499
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,960
presenting it today with the mpls two

1500
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,559
replications it could have been

1501
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,359
connected

1502
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,839
via a unicast domain segment routing

1503
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,200
domain and then the seat at the

1504
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,680
replication points the job of the seat

1505
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,640
was to provide forwarding instructions

1506
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:18,960
for

1507
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,079
replication of the packet that said

1508
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,119
we did extend the replication seat into

1509
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,720
srv6

1510
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,119
nothing new here we did not reinvent the

1511
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,000
wheel

1512
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,520
it is the current srv6 infrastructure

1513
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,720
all we did is we introduced a brand new

1514
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,480
function which is the replication

1515
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:39,520
function

1516
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,359
think of it as the mpls replication seat

1517
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:46,480
which we are just putting it in the srv6

1518
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,559
function and it's called the replication

1519
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,880
function within the srv6

1520
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,119
again nothing new all the goodies that

1521
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:54,000
were there

1522
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,319
previously are going to be carried

1523
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,319
forward with the srv6

1524
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,319
the replication points will be

1525
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,400
replicating the information based on

1526
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,160
that replication

1527
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,359
sit within the srv6 two replication

1528
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,440
points can be connected to each other

1529
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,079
via

1530
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,839
ipv6 unicast which is part of the srv6

1531
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:18,240
again draft and and functionality

1532
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:23,839
next slide please

1533
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,680
so i kind of touched base on this slide

1534
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,039
too i i tried to

1535
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,839
simplify it as much as i as i could

1536
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:32,559
again the

1537
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,160
replication function that we introduced

1538
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,480
on the replication nodes it has the

1539
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,160
forwarding information

1540
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,559
so we can figure out the outgoing

1541
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,079
interfaces

1542
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,319
uh and you know pushing the new

1543
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:47,599
replication function

1544
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,400
for downstream nodes that they're going

1545
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,240
to do the same replication over and over

1546
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,480
again until we get to the leaf node

1547
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,079
at the leaf node based on the

1548
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:58,240
replication function we can

1549
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:01,839
remove the encapsulation

1550
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,520
and actually look at the payload and

1551
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,440
forward it to the hosts that are

1552
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,559
connected to that

1553
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:09,920
leaf node on the bud node obviously it

1554
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,280
does both functions

1555
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,559
again when the replication segment

1556
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,039
is examined on the bot node there is

1557
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,720
going to be a local

1558
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,440
packet that is going to be extracted for

1559
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:21,760
the

1560
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,319
bud node and there could be many other

1561
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:26,240
outgoing interfaces based on that

1562
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,599
replication function

1563
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,160
that the packet will be replicated and

1564
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,880
forwarded

1565
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,799
out the outgoing interfaces

1566
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,000
next slide please

1567
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:45,359
so just a quick example here again

1568
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:48,480
the node one here is the root note root

1569
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,280
uh node number two is a replication

1570
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,000
point

1571
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,359
and your leaf nodes are number

1572
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,720
five six and seven

1573
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,960
so you know i i made a connection

1574
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,760
between

1575
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,680
node five and seven but that connection

1576
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,960
could not be there

1577
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,559
uh or it could be there it doesn't

1578
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:08,880
matter but those are the leaf nodes

1579
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,640
so the node one is the one that actually

1580
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,359
pushes the srv6

1581
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:15,920
in cap on top of the payload it will

1582
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,039
forward it

1583
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,160
to the node 2 giving the

1584
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,440
the function f1 sorry giving the

1585
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,400
function f2

1586
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,880
at the node 2 the replication function

1587
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,440
f2

1588
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:29,680
actually going to have the forwarding

1589
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,520
information that it needs to replicate

1590
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,640
the packet

1591
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:36,880
via 3 2 6 or forward the packet 2

1592
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,720
5 as another oif or a third oif

1593
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,599
forwarding the packet to four which will

1594
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,039
then forward the packet

1595
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,240
and to node number seven so number

1596
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:50,960
uh node number two really is working as

1597
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,799
a replication point

1598
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:56,160
as you can see uh the examples at note

1599
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,200
number six

1600
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,599
there is going to be a replication uh uh

1601
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,119
function f6

1602
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,680
which will encapsul uh decapsulate the

1603
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,720
srv6

1604
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,559
and grab the payload and forward it to

1605
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:09,200
the host same as story with node number

1606
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,319
five

1607
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,599
there is going to be a replication

1608
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,520
function or a replication set of

1609
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:16,799
f5 which will decapsulate the srv6 and

1610
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,719
forward the

1611
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,479
payload to the to the host that is

1612
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,080
connected to the

1613
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,198
to node number five and going to number

1614
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:26,158
seven we can

1615
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,880
really do a traffic engineering and you

1616
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,640
know force the packet through

1617
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:34,399
uh note 4 and then eventually note 4

1618
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,960
vr function will forward that packet to

1619
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,279
note 7 which has a replication

1620
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:43,359
seat of f7 and it will pop the srv6 and

1621
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,319
forward

1622
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,600
the packet to the host so again

1623
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,759
nothing new we are just using the

1624
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,600
existing srv6

1625
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,520
functionality out there for traffic

1626
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,640
engineering

1627
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,198
etc etc we are introducing a very

1628
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,399
powerful

1629
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,679
functionality here which is a

1630
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:01,679
replication function

1631
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,319
and then you can connect to replication

1632
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:05,198
function

1633
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,158
via unicast domain or you can chain them

1634
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:09,920
together to create a tree

1635
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,439
it is very flexible it can do

1636
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:15,600
any type of forwarding unicast or

1637
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,839
multicast anywhere within the domain of

1638
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,719
srv6

1639
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,520
that's all i had for this presentation

1640
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,880
thank you any comments questions

1641
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,600
if not thank you very much folks

1642
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,520
appreciate your time yeah thank you so

1643
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,000
the

1644
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,560
as you said the only addition is srv6

1645
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,839
functionality which you've put in the

1646
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:43,198
appendix do you intended to keep it in

1647
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,839
the appendix

1648
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,679
uh in in yeah i i believe so

1649
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,839
uh we need to discuss that a little bit

1650
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,439
further but yeah that

1651
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:55,280
that's where it is right now yes and

1652
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,640
there are some updates i think within

1653
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,600
the

1654
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,280
body of the draft i can't remember

1655
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,159
exactly but the yeah all the updates are

1656
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:04,719
already

1657
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,199
within there

1658
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,600
okay and the first slide

1659
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,560
stick the only thing you just update

1660
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,920
these slides because this is now a

1661
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,800
working group draft

1662
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,560
go up one more first very first slide

1663
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,000
yeah i apologize yeah i kept doing that

1664
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,080
i did that for beer too

1665
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,560
okay this car this stuff is really

1666
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,840
getting into me

1667
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,120
thank you it's like time is just staying

1668
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,600
a steal for me

1669
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,640
it's unbelievable almost over hopefully

1670
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,840
yeah thank you

1671
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,480
we had assert packing now is that right

1672
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,400
start packing now just about this

1673
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,519
hello can you hear me now

1674
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,719
yes we can yeah

1675
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,400
thank you today i will

1676
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,440
present the update of the pim asset

1677
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,639
mass packing draft next slide please

1678
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:41,040
next slightly please

1679
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,159
uh firstly i will give a very quick

1680
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,120
review of the uh problem and the

1681
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:47,840
solution

1682
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,040
overview of this draft and uh

1683
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,440
both in the network side and the hostess

1684
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,719
side

1685
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,159
in the shared network uh

1686
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:02,480
p merced may maybe happen

1687
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:06,800
because the multicast server service uh

1688
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,320
becomes wide widely deployed and the

1689
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,560
a large number of uh multicast entries

1690
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,320
increase and uh

1691
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,360
and maybe a a large number of

1692
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,920
a certain message uh may be sent in a

1693
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,280
very short period

1694
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,719
and that made uh trig

1695
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,320
many p mercedes uh in in the shared

1696
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:33,199
networks

1697
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:36,960
so it may maybe in

1698
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:41,280
make the asset a certain packet

1699
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,800
uh not be processed in time or even is

1700
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,440
discussed

1701
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:49,199
and it will make the delay

1702
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,719
of the traffic duplication in the

1703
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,239
network next

1704
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:54,879
slide please

1705
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:02,640
and in this chapter we have promoted a

1706
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,600
two solution uh at the uh

1707
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,719
division uh defined that

1708
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,760
the two solution and and we

1709
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,679
use the pim hello option uh to

1710
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,880
distinguish these to both the

1711
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,760
uh solution one is the simple packing

1712
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,520
solution and the other is a

1713
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,560
aggregating packing solution that is

1714
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,520
uh make the same source or the same rp

1715
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,600
address

1716
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,000
and it saves the uh

1717
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,159
package space and there is no change to

1718
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:43,600
the pmr set state

1719
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,640
machine for this uh solution

1720
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,920
for this both these solution solutions

1721
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,880
next slide please

1722
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,920
uh the update of this draft uh there are

1723
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,040
two

1724
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:05,280
steps uh aspects

1725
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,960
one is that the we update the

1726
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:12,239
p merced pack packing format and the

1727
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,000
format is updated to align

1728
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,880
with the rfc 8736

1729
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,840
and the pim9 register packing draft

1730
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,199
and the and the

1731
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,640
uh the pin pin type uh field

1732
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,520
update is no factor with the with this

1733
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,800
draft solution

1734
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,560
uh because we remain to use the

1735
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:42,159
uh p merced type

1736
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:46,320
for for the uh packing or certain

1737
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,320
and the count field we

1738
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,840
update to align the pim nung register

1739
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,760
uh packing

1740
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,120
solution because they're not necessary

1741
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:01,920
to

1742
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,000
define another format

1743
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:11,839
next slide please

1744
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,760
and the second point we add some uh

1745
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,840
brief analysis for the p merced tamar

1746
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,000
and

1747
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:27,199
uh sorry uh the previous

1748
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,640
and the there is no effect on the uh

1749
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,679
existed

1750
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,440
uh as a timer uh mechanism

1751
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,280
for both the star g and the sg

1752
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:42,320
so because the a sub winner sends

1753
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,840
a third message due to the local period

1754
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,480
of time

1755
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,600
expiration uh

1756
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,239
depending on the implementation of the

1757
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,760
time accuracy

1758
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,199
of maybe in the same

1759
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,239
second or in the same millisecond

1760
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:03,520
etc that

1761
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,520
the pim strategy or sg

1762
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,080
will expire which are expelled at the

1763
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:15,360
same time will be sent by the packing

1764
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,320
message

1765
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,360
instead of the individual pen message

1766
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:24,480
so there is no other uh change

1767
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:30,080
in this process

1768
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,400
yeah can i comment on that so i think

1769
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,840
this

1770
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,560
this looks great to me the only thing i

1771
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,280
would point out is

1772
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,600
if you have a third timers that expire

1773
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,800
at almost the same

1774
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,400
time right then you could grip multiple

1775
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,480
together the key thing is that you don't

1776
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,520
send a cert

1777
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,560
too late but it's okay if you send a

1778
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,199
search

1779
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:57,760
maybe a few milliseconds or a second or

1780
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,400
something

1781
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,120
earlier right so maybe it could be a

1782
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:01,760
good test

1783
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,480
guidance on uh yeah along those lines

1784
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,679
uh once you let's say if you have many

1785
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,120
asserts going off

1786
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,880
like this yeah right now and some are

1787
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,800
about to expire in one second then you

1788
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,719
could send all of them now

1789
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,719
and after that they would all be in sync

1790
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,480
so you could keep sending all of them at

1791
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,679
the same time

1792
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:31,840
after that

1793
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,960
okay okay i'll consider after the

1794
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:35,920
meeting

1795
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,239
okay

1796
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,840
and

1797
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:59,120
okay thank you thank you for stick

1798
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,440
and the next step for this uh draft and

1799
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,640
uh uh i will add some

1800
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,520
some uh operations of asset packing for

1801
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,199
how to uh

1802
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,360
perform this asset packing

1803
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,840
in the network and any further comments

1804
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,159
are welcomed

1805
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:27,839
that's all thank you

1806
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:36,880
thank you appreciate it late night

1807
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,600
in in china yeah

1808
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:44,000
thank you

1809
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,400
all right i think we got no register no

1810
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,320
should we consider working with loss

1811
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,440
called now or

1812
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,839
should we wait for more input first

1813
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,840
as one of the authors okay go ahead i'm

1814
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:08,320
sorry

1815
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,600
okay uh i i i i don't think

1816
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,280
it's it's ready for last call now okay

1817
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,640
okay yeah yeah at least i would say i

1818
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,440
uh i read through it again and i think

1819
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,560
it's in

1820
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,600
good shape but yeah i'll provide

1821
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,040
a few comments myself and hope other

1822
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:37,840
people can read it and comment as well

1823
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,840
hmm

1824
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,960
great are we ready for okay no right

1825
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,080
there

1826
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,360
thank you very soon okay

1827
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,839
thank you

1828
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,360
you can start

1829
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:56,000
okay uh can everybody hear me okay

1830
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,600
yeah all right um

1831
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,360
so yeah we had the sixth

1832
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,400
draft for uh pim null register backing

1833
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:06,880
and

1834
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,600
we've uploaded the seventh one uh stick

1835
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:14,080
you can go to the second slide

1836
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:15,920
so there were a bunch of reviews and

1837
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,760
thank you everybody for reviewing

1838
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,880
uh the draft uh we've fixed

1839
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,239
all the editorial comments uh but there

1840
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:25,040
seemed to be

1841
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,760
uh some discussions around how the

1842
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:30,159
downgrade scenario would work

1843
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,760
and if the capability check is

1844
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,280
enough for the packing

1845
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,120
or null register packing to work

1846
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,800
so i'll be just discussing the

1847
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,280
capability check once and i hope that

1848
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,719
clears up any uh confusions uh let's go

1849
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:49,440
to the third

1850
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,159
slide stick

1851
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,000
uh so this would be the uh

1852
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,719
pim register stop it that's sent from

1853
01:21:58,719 --> 01:21:59,199
the

1854
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,560
rp to the dr and uh

1855
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,000
it would set the pivot if it's capable

1856
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,840
of handling uh pimp packed null

1857
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,000
registers

1858
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,199
um so at the dr um

1859
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,440
the dr will send an unpacked null

1860
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,800
register to the rp

1861
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,719
after the rst expires and

1862
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,199
the rp can send back the or the register

1863
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,000
stop with

1864
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,280
this capability bit set or unset

1865
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,800
and at the dr um when we receive the

1866
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,159
register stop

1867
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,800
uh we can just check if it's capable of

1868
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,920
handling the

1869
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,760
uh null packed null registers or not

1870
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,400
uh so this is now explained uh better in

1871
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,560
section seven

1872
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:49,440
um so any questions about this

1873
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,719
or any uh comments on if there's any way

1874
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:53,760
to make this better

1875
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,159
as well

1876
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,800
okay uh there were some additional

1877
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,400
questions too which is which are not

1878
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,239
covered in the slides because i sent

1879
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:05,440
them

1880
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,840
before they came back but they were to

1881
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,040
address lenny's

1882
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,600
comments uh so there was a question

1883
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,560
about

1884
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,280
whether uh pim null register packing

1885
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,080
will treat

1886
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:19,280
any cast rp with mst any different

1887
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,560
and the response is that it will not

1888
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,440
uh for both mechanisms uh pim null

1889
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,040
register packing

1890
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,159
uh will work only if any cass rp's in

1891
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,159
the entire rp set supported

1892
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:35,040
so that's uh a comment that it's that

1893
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,159
would be clear in the

1894
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:39,520
in the latest draft um and also

1895
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,400
i um i accept the comments about the

1896
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,320
usage of pim registers

1897
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:47,199
and uh null registers being

1898
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:48,639
interchangeably used

1899
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,600
in the draft so i fixed that as well in

1900
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:52,560
the latest one

1901
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,560
uh that hasn't been uploaded here that

1902
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,400
would be the eighth draft

1903
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,360
uh but we will clear any ambiguity

1904
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,080
between

1905
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,400
the usage of a null register or the

1906
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,480
usage of a data register

1907
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,679
so um the packing is only for uh

1908
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,159
pim null registers or pim register stop

1909
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,120
messages so

1910
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,560
we will make that very clear in the

1911
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,400
eighth draft

1912
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,560
so the last slide is just to know about

1913
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,760
the next steps and

1914
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,060
if we can make a call on this because um

1915
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,320
[Music]

1916
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:26,960
because that's all we've addressed all

1917
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,159
the other comments

1918
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:31,839
based on this

1919
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:42,080
yes so there were some um there were

1920
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,320
some comments especially about the

1921
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,280
downgrade scenario that people had

1922
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,000
um so i don't know whether we should try

1923
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:50,639
to

1924
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:53,360
see if they they are okay or if they

1925
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:54,320
still think they're

1926
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,000
they have any concerns um or we could

1927
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,080
wait for yeah do that during working

1928
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,199
group last call

1929
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,560
i don't know if you have any thoughts on

1930
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,040
that mike

1931
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,440
that's what i was gonna ask you about if

1932
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,920
when when the new rev is submitted and

1933
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,960
the working group is

1934
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,360
comfortable with it it sounds like we do

1935
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,800
need to issue another working group last

1936
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,520
call is that correct

1937
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:26,719
or do we just say okay we've yeah

1938
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,520
we probably should do another last call

1939
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,400
um

1940
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,719
but at least we had some review already

1941
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,239
so um

1942
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:38,718
yeah so that that helps us

1943
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:42,320
right okay so but i would like to

1944
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,199
um yeah these the people that reviewed

1945
01:25:45,199 --> 01:25:46,159
it i would like to

1946
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,719
you know get them to somehow confirm

1947
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:50,560
maybe as part of the last call that they

1948
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:55,520
are okay with the latest revision

1949
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,400
okay and there's as was presented

1950
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,600
there's one more revision coming up

1951
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,920
correct

1952
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:08,800
so so there's an eighth

1953
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,280
yes okay thank you so

1954
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,600
when that's done then stig we should

1955
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,440
issue a working group last call

1956
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,800
well maybe we should just ping everybody

1957
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,080
who's commented to make sure that

1958
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,239
everybody's cool with what's happened to

1959
01:26:24,239 --> 01:26:25,280
that point do a working

1960
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,480
blast call and then um

1961
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:31,840
you and i um thoroughly review it

1962
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,400
again one more time before we send it

1963
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,239
back to avro

1964
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:39,600
i think that's a good plan yeah

1965
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,480
so sounds good

1966
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,519
okay thank you everyone

1967
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:51,839
yeah thanks

1968
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:19,840
so

1969
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:39,120
yeah start a little slow here thank you

1970
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,120
hi everyone can you hear me

1971
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,800
yes

1972
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,719
so today i'm going to talk about the

1973
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,360
stateless

1974
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,760
srv6 pointed to multiple in the past

1975
01:27:53,760 --> 01:28:00,719
next page

1976
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:02,880
so firstly i would like to thank you

1977
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,239
very much for ac

1978
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,800
and jeffrey for their uh relevant

1979
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:07,520
comments

1980
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,719
uh during the last adoption call

1981
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:13,840
so in this updated version we address

1982
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,600
all the comments

1983
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,000
so basically the updates is that we

1984
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,600
change the status to

1985
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,639
experimental for this draft

1986
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:25,679
we added a new section

1987
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,800
so it's about a steadily

1988
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:34,239
srv6 p2mp path for english node

1989
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,600
and then we change the name

1990
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:40,840
as our v6p to a

1991
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,080
named stateless as a

1992
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,320
v63p as requested by singapore jf

1993
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,320
so jeff requested us to change the name

1994
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:51,440
because the

1995
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:54,480
first name they already used in the

1996
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,000
other documents

1997
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,040
and then we added a text about a split

1998
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,320
subtree for segment list of

1999
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,440
repeat size and then we added the

2000
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,639
example

2001
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:10,639
for ip header using a compression

2002
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,159
seat next page

2003
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:24,639
so in order to have a ppmp pass

2004
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,120
setup in the in the network we should

2005
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,480
have a controller

2006
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,679
such as typically we use people use pc

2007
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,679
as a controller so initially

2008
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,880
we should have connections

2009
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,800
between pc to

2010
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,360
all the possible english nodes of the

2011
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,320
network

2012
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,840
we only need to connect controller

2013
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,480
to possible english node we don't need

2014
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,679
to controller

2015
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,920
to connect to any nodes inside the

2016
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,320
domain

2017
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,000
in addition initially pc pc

2018
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,520
as a controller will

2019
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,840
obtain the information about the network

2020
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,280
so this is normally done through

2021
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,960
igp or bgp so pc just have a

2022
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,920
passive session or peer relation to any

2023
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,400
one of the nodes in the domain and then

2024
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,199
pc you can get all the information about

2025
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:25,520
the

2026
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,920
network such as link bandwidth and

2027
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,040
lingua color

2028
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,719
and loader seats

2029
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,480
in including those uh multicast

2030
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,199
c is configured on on the replication

2031
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:39,760
node

2032
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,679
so pc you will get all those information

2033
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,760
so after piece i have connection

2034
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,560
from pc to possible english node and the

2035
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,600
pc get those

2036
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,239
network informations so pce as a

2037
01:30:54,239 --> 01:30:55,520
controller can

2038
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,400
accept a request either from application

2039
01:30:58,400 --> 01:30:59,520
or from

2040
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,120
from users so

2041
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,239
the request as soon as the pc receives

2042
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:10,320
the request from user or application

2043
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,400
so pce will compute the path

2044
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:18,719
after pc get a pass

2045
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,360
it will construct a second release for

2046
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:22,719
that path

2047
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,920
and then send that second list to the

2048
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:28,080
english node

2049
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,800
so after english note received this

2050
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,080
secondary list

2051
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:37,040
so english node will set up the path

2052
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,400
and then send the status of the pass

2053
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:45,040
to pce so pce after receiving the report

2054
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:48,960
from the english node pce will record

2055
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,239
the status of this path into its a

2056
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:56,639
task database so that's the roughly

2057
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,600
the past computation and the past setup

2058
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:00,800
we got into

2059
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,400
stateless there's a physics p20p path

2060
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:12,639
next page

2061
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,800
so as i mentioned that we changed the

2062
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:15,760
name

2063
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,199
so because as a physics piton p uh

2064
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:20,800
as jeffrey john mentioned that is

2065
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,320
already used by

2066
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,960
their their solutions so they have

2067
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,080
different meanings so

2068
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,360
we change p to sr

2069
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,560
p term p in our document to

2070
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,679
stateless s r v six p down p

2071
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:39,120
because in the context of our document

2072
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:43,360
the p2p path is we don't have any space

2073
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:47,040
per pass space in the core of a network

2074
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:49,600
next page

2075
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,760
so also we added the uh descriptions

2076
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,639
about this uh split subtree i think this

2077
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,199
is a

2078
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:02,320
very good suggestion from uh ac

2079
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:05,920
ac so we added text with regarding to

2080
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,080
so in the case we have limited about a

2081
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,120
segment size

2082
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,920
segment this size so in that case we

2083
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:12,960
will

2084
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,400
split some tree into multiple

2085
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,600
sub trees such that for each of the

2086
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,040
subtree

2087
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:24,400
they can be encoded in the second list

2088
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:24,719
of

2089
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:28,960
finite size next page

2090
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:34,320
so also uh we as a request by jeffrey

2091
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:34,880
john

2092
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,920
jefferson suggests that we

2093
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,760
should have an example of ip header

2094
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,880
using one of our configurations

2095
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,679
see the comparisons so we give a example

2096
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:55,440
encoding using gsrv6 compression

2097
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:59,760
so this gives us details how we use

2098
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:04,960
compressed speed to encode a piton b3

2099
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,520
next page

2100
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,960
yeah i think that's all we the updates

2101
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,320
in the

2102
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,639
in the new version of the document so we

2103
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:18,320
would welcome

2104
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,480
comments and also as a per share request

2105
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,760
we will continue discuss in pin

2106
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,679
along with those active in springs

2107
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:33,840
thank you

2108
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:47,840
and thank you any questions

2109
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:54,080
yeah at least one question i have is

2110
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:57,119
really yeah what the relationship should

2111
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:58,639
be with springs

2112
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,960
i don't

2113
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,759
or not

2114
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:12,080
yeah basically i send a request to lease

2115
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,280
to get um comments

2116
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,520
regarding to this draft but we're

2117
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:18,480
waiting for

2118
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,159
any comments from the spring working

2119
01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:22,400
group

2120
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:27,199
okay it is a it is a challenge spring is

2121
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:28,000
so

2122
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
busy and they've got so many higher

2123
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,080
priority

2124
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,239
non-multicast related discussions going

2125
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:36,159
on that uh

2126
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,760
it's hard to break in um which is partly

2127
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,080
why

2128
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,920
we're working on some of that related

2129
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,480
work here in pym

2130
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:48,480
but there was so yeah sorry

2131
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
i'm going to say we had a lot of

2132
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,440
discussion on the mailing list about

2133
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,159
this draft

2134
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,840
and yeah it's great to have some

2135
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,520
activity on the mailing list

2136
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,679
um it would be good to hear um

2137
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:03,600
yeah to what you know whether people

2138
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,080
think that it addressed those concerns

2139
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,199
uh the concerns they had or not i mean

2140
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:10,800
there were there were people in the

2141
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,480
in favor of adopting it and there were

2142
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,840
people like again

2143
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,920
um and um it'd be interesting to see you

2144
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,040
know

2145
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,639
if if some people have changed their

2146
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,119
minds if they think the new person is

2147
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:24,880
better or i guess it could be

2148
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,480
worse but hopefully better

2149
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,400
yeah it's a it's a good question

2150
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,080
speaking as an individual it just it

2151
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,520
goes back to

2152
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,520
since i'm on this draft so it just kind

2153
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,880
of goes back to you know we already have

2154
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,040
a good solution we've adopted within pim

2155
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,600
um you know do we need another solution

2156
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,080
that

2157
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,840
tackles it a different way it's kind of

2158
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,920
the age-old question

2159
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,280
and my views are

2160
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,880
our and i've expressed these before in

2161
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,719
other words is that it's we should be

2162
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:56,320
open to multiple solutions but

2163
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,000
um if they're technically sound and

2164
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,600
so this working group just has to decide

2165
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,560
that but regardless we do need to um

2166
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,280
get buy-in from spring because we got

2167
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,199
buy-in from spring on the existing draft

2168
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,520
that we are working on in pen

2169
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,840
right but yeah either way it's good to

2170
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,280
get more comments on this

2171
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:21,840
and keep improving the documents yeah

2172
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:35,839
no no no comments

2173
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,360
yeah i think the next steps probably

2174
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:52,000
should be to um

2175
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,600
both to uh ask on the mailing list

2176
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,040
for input and also um

2177
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,119
like i can also try to trigger help

2178
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:02,639
trigger that

2179
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,840
and and also to reach out to

2180
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,119
spring again okay okay thank you thank

2181
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:16,400
you very much all right

2182
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,638
thanks

2183
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:30,000
anything else before me close
