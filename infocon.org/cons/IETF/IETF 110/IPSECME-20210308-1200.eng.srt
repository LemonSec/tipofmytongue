1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:16,800
good morning

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,199
hello

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
hello so i think it's

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,680
whatever time of uh two o'clock in

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
helsinki time i don't know what it is i

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,840
think it's

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,120
yeah so the third time is two o'clock

i think we'll wait like uh one more

10
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559

11
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,600

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,199

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,120
all right so let's see

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,479
sometime

18
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,600
that is the first session of the itif

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
uh 110

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
disciplisec maintenance and ib security

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,799
maintenance and

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
extensors working group and if you are

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,080
in the wrong room

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
you can go now out like everybody

25
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
normally goes this time and noticing oh

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
i'm reading email in program

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
so let's see

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
so let's start with okay

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,399
so this is the note well i guess

30
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,079
everybody has seen this

31
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,640
a few times already and this is the

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,040
first time you are seeing this time

33
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
this ietf but it's the same text hasn't

34
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,119
changed

35
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,720
at least i haven't changed the text in

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,640
the slides so

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
if it's wrong it's still wrong

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,159
okay so we don't have blue streaks we

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,600
are taking the minutes uh

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,959
the attendancy i think it gets filled in

41
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,560
by automatically by the data tracker or

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,239
something like that

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,760
uh we want to have a note takers i

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,120
there is already pre-filled stuff in the

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,920
uh etherpad nodes actually it is comedy

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,720
night could i

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,920
i mean now and i michael already said

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,959
that he would be

49
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,920
willing to work as a notetaker but it

50
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,879
would be useful to have

51
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,840
somebody else also any voters

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,640
so michael you are still okay with with

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,679
doing the minutes

54
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,360
yes i'm okay doing it all right good

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,720
okay so i will try to follow the chopper

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,560
also and i think we have already have a

57
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,959
one

58
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
one of the choppers you know

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,480
scribes trying to help if there's

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
something in there

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,959
all right there isn't the meet echo link

62
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
which you are probably aware of if you

63
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,640
are already here

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
and so let's see let's go forward

65
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,319
so we have quite a lot of items in the

66
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:36,959
agenda

67
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
this week but most of them are very

68
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,040
short

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
just a status update or something like

70
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
that

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,159
so we have a document status uh then we

72
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:48,640
have

73
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,840
work items uh which covers the group key

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,439
management and the iptfs staff

75
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,519
both the base and the young document

76
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,280
and then we have lots of new items or

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,879
send me new items

78
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
uh like the configuration for encrypted

79
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,480
dns and

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
new payload format and equation one

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,319
graveyard

82
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,599
sd1 edge discovery and

83
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,918
x509 extensions and alternate signature

84
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,720
schemes

85
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,918
uh optional sats payloads inside

86
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,479
excellent and multi sa performance

87
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,680
any comments on the agenda

88
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,919
if not i think we will go forward the

89
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:32,800
first one is the

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,919
working group status of the

91
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,240
drafts so we published the ipv6 ipv4

92
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,400
codes as an rfc8983

93
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
we have do documents that are now

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
in i think it actually passed last call

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
now

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
the i question to intermediate we didn't

97
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,639
get any

98
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
comments during the last call and then

99
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
we have an iptfs which had some comments

100
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
and we are going to have

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,520
some update on iptfs later uh

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
then we have uh the young

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
iptfs staff that is was just adopted

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
as a working group document then we have

105
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,440
gi version 2 that i

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,080
think is ready for the working club last

107
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
goal and i think

108
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,520
we should be starting it hasn't been

109
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
receiving that many

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,880
reviews but i think if we started

111
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,479
working club last call we hopefully get

112
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,160
some reviews and

113
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,720
it's it's a no document it has been

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,080
having lots of you know and we have a

115
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,199
presentation of that

116
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,320
also yeah multiple

117
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,240
key exchanges and labeled ipsec

118
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,280
and the rfc 82 to 9bs

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,180
some of those actually i think the

120
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,759
[Music]

121
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,680
multiple key exchange is also something

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
that is ready for the last call

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,759
all right so for the lab of ip sector

124
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
suppose uh paul can say a couple of

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
words for about this

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,759
so go head ball

127
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
okay test one two three everybody can

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
hear me yeah

129
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,639
okay great um so just on level type a

130
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:08,960
sec

131
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,759
um there hasn't really been a change in

132
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,560
the draft

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,960
um we've been doing some implementation

134
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
with the linux kernel

135
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,759
using the sa linux security module as

136
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,000
the

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,280
uh the secure label provider

138
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,800
um it's been really uh it's been

139
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,039
like non-standardized technology in

140
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
ikev1 and in the linux kernel for like

141
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
over 10 years

142
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,560
and so we're just standardizing this use

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,160
for ikv2

144
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
and and so we've we've done quite some

145
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,919
work on it

146
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
but most of this work is now happening

147
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,479
on the sc linux specific parts

148
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,880
so i think as a document it's really

149
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,639
just ready for

150
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,720
last call i don't think there's any open

151
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,360
issues or any small issues left

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
and the only thing we could talk about

153
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,560
because we had quite some problems

154
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
with the se linux implementation is that

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
should we add something as an appendix

156
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,280
or i think

157
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,880
what might be a better idea is actually

158
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,479
do a different document with the se

159
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,240
linux implementation so that we can

160
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
document that

161
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,440
but so maybe that should be a separate

162
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
draft

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,080
all right so

164
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,080
i think we should be ready for the last

165
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,840
call for that and i

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,400
think it has been out for a long time

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,759
and

168
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,759
i haven't received any i don't remember

169
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,280
he's seen that many comments in lately

170
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,039
we did uh publish the code last month

171
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:39,840
for egg v2

172
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,840
so there's an implementation out there

173
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,319
okay

174
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
so does anybody have any comments about

175
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,360
uh

176
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
or concerns uh putting this in working

177
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
group last call if not i think you will

178
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,240
start a

179
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,960
group last course almost immediately

180
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
after this meeting

181
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,000
um uh after you've got a resolution on

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
that there was a question from lou

183
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,840
uh about the previous slide and

184
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,639
whether there we go i dropped ietf ipsec

185
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,400
me iptfs

186
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,160
he was asking which one

187
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
i guess uh third item down oh yeah

188
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
that's actually wrong yeah i i

189
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
pasted it from from the previous slides

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,000
uh previous uh

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
meeting and then it was still hops yeah

192
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,320
to change that

193
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,599
thanks yeah

194
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,200
okay all right so

195
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
then that's about the labeled eye piece

196
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,440
of category starting working with

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,040
plastic of that

198
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
and then we go to the presentations

199
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
so we have a group key management using

200
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,760
iperson2

201
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
valerie you are up

202
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,480
can you hear me yes i can hear you

203
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,839
okay so uh

204
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
group key management using ip2 and next

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
slide please

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
uh first of all it's just a reminder

207
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
what is it

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,480
what it is about and where it is used

209
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
and about securing id multicast

210
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,320
and uh multicast supplement applications

211
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,640
you

212
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
usually have at least one center and

213
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
many receivers

214
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,160
and you take advantage of multicast

215
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,120
routing

216
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,920
which delivers packet to multiple uh

217
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,680
recipient

218
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,800
so that all these recipients share one

219
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
essay

220
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,120
so they share the same key so this

221
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
requires some architecture to distribute

222
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,240
these uh shared uh keys

223
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,279
between this recipient so usually this

224
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,160
uh

225
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,880
architecture uh consists of a group

226
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,600
controller

227
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,279
casera and uh a single group controller

228
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,000
cassava which uh generates and

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,839
distribute keys and

230
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,120
some group members and

231
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,279
group members first create a unicast

232
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,680
iqv2 sa to grow control the kisera

233
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
and after that group control kisera

234
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,839
distributed game material and then it

235
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,320
can

236
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,480
her key using either unicast or

237
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,480
multicast

238
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,839
uh so next please

239
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
so uh recently a new application for

240
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,560
this protocol

241
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
appeared its distribution of group keys

242
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,320
in ieee 802.15

243
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,480
so

244
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,680
one five 802.15 nine specifies iq two as

245
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,920
one of key management protocols for

246
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,600
uh 802 15 four

247
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,040
and uh the first as far as i understand

248
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,200
uh the current standard for 80 to

249
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,640
15 9 from 2015 and that group key

250
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
distribution out of scope

251
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
but the current draft zero five version

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,880
of this standard

253
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
and it specifies this g ic2 is used for

254
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,640
row key distribution

255
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,079
so it uses gsa inventory key exchange

256
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,600
over unicast to say

257
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,340
and it allows to

258
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,480
[Music]

259
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,519
distribute to provide to

260
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,690
convey group keys

261
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,959
[Music]

262
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,279
to members of

263
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,959
82 15 the two

264
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,959
networks so and spi field in gcp load is

265
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,760
used very

266
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
specially to and it specifies the type

267
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,519
of probe key to

268
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,519
which is distributed so it's a new

269
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
application for this protocol

270
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,839
and you imagine application so the next

271
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,120
please

272
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,120
so then uh about the document status

273
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
the document has been in development for

274
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,240
several years

275
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,880
so for a very long time and a few

276
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
implementations of

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
early draft version exists that are

278
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,639
incompatible with the current draft

279
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,720
it was adopted it has been adopted by

280
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,920
bisect me a working group in

281
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,560
2019 and

282
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,519
version 01 from july 2020 it was a major

283
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,160
rewrite

284
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,000
of the early document uh early version

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
and since then

286
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
a new version appeared it was a minor

287
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,560
update

288
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,920
and what i'm worried about is uh

289
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,839
the lack of uh reviews because from

290
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
house's point of view the draft looks

291
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,959
mature but

292
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,160
we are worrying that the document

293
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,000
hasn't received as many reviews it

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
shoot due to its complexity

295
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,399
and its

296
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,800
very

297
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,200
deep integration into the

298
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680
iq2 so the next please

299
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,920
so it's an outline of the marginal right

300
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,880
changes

301
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,000
just to let you know what was changed

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,880
so compare it with the previous version

303
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,680
of this

304
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,639
draft first the policy representation is

305
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,680
changed

306
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,639
before it was like ip1 style mostly

307
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,079
using attributes

308
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,480
if you remember like we wanted it all

309
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,760
these all the

310
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,440
algorithms were specified in the

311
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,880
attributes

312
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,920
and the set of this attribute specified

313
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,800
a policy

314
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,760
now it's more like ip2 style using

315
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,800
transforms

316
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
and attributes are still used for some

317
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,040
variables that are not

318
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,959
enumeration like initial

319
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,120
message id values that can be changed

320
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,360
over time over time

321
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
then uh that's the convention the

322
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,160
the other thing that is followed from

323
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,360
the first

324
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
ballot is the format of json and kg

325
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
below changed

326
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,440
and group key representation is changed

327
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
before group key was transferred and

328
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,079
clear

329
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,639
inside key distribution the distribution

330
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,680
below

331
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,240
and now all key are encrypted inside kg

332
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,279
below

333
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,680
either using skd derived key or using

334
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
another group key

335
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
the reason the rationale for this is

336
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,399
that

337
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,399
now i implementation itself

338
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
doesn't see keys and clear

339
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,560
so the key is that they can be stored

340
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,519
somewhere in

341
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,480
hardware security model and even if you

342
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,199
hack

343
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,079
the diamonds like diamond you still

344
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,000
don't access to the keys because key are

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,279
encrypted

346
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
even inside uh like messages i think

347
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,199
that

348
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,720
it's a major change then another change

349
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,199
that

350
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,079
logical key hierarchy uh key

351
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,680
distribution

352
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
algorithm is now integrated into the

353
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,600
core gi critical

354
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,199
uh before it was uh

355
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,639
some addition that is that was optional

356
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,519
uh for implementation now the protocol

357
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,959
is changed in such a way

358
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,880
that all the of the key management

359
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,000
techniques

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,880
is uh it is gccs that

361
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,959
implements all the key management

362
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,880
techniques and for a

363
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
group member it doesn't

364
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
matter which technique is used either

365
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,000
it's a

366
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,120
logical ki haraju or just distribution

367
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,600
uh keys without this hierarchy

368
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
so i think it's also a major change

369
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,360
and let's please

370
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,160
uh so the ionic considerations are

371
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,199
written

372
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,240
now it's more an extension of ip2 so

373
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,880
that all

374
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,839
registries uh that are concerned with

375
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,120
jqe2

376
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,360
uh leave live they are now in either in

377
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,480
core iq2 uh on the page

378
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
it is not in separate page and it also

379
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,199
updates many ip2 existing registries

380
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,199
like uh transforms and so on

381
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,839
uh many balancers have been renamed to

382
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,480
reflect

383
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,279
their purpose a lot of qualifications

384
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
for example our load calculation which

385
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,199
was very unclear

386
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,920
with the multi-cluster key messages it

387
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,600
described in detail

388
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
uh introduced means to indicate

389
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
cross-dependency of supported algorithms

390
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,679
using ppk's jquery is clarified using

391
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,520
usain is clarified

392
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
uh for lower in situation if some

393
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,640
messages are lost

394
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,919
during multicast three keys clarified uh

395
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,720
well

396
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,959
example is rewritten using lth

397
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
so the next please

398
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
so what about in more details about gsa

399
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,280
below

400
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,880
disabled contain policy necessary

401
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,200
to participate in the group it's uh

402
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,320
protocol

403
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,880
protocol can be either data security ah

404
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,080
esp ah is

405
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,080
for historical reason of course nobody

406
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,120
uses it

407
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,440
or gi crickey it's a new protocol that

408
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,840
is used that is ip2

409
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,440
like as it is used for multicast uh key

410
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,640
messages so it contains also traffic

411
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,360
selector

412
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,760
transforms and for algorithm and method

413
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,679
used in the policy in attributes for

414
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,080
variables like initial message i mean

415
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,360
jessica format is now common for

416
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,840
uh gi quirky it's uh

417
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,600
g iq gi q 2 essays it is used for a key

418
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
and for data security multicast to say

419
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
it's not common

420
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,799
and especially uh some specific

421
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,160
uh case is a jet preload that is growth

422
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,240
policy law that shares the same format

423
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
and specifies the policies it doesn't

424
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,559
depend uh depends on the protocol

425
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,280
the next piece

426
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,280
uh kde polo j plot contains key material

427
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
necessary for the policy in the gsa

428
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,320
below

429
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,880
so it is now consists of funnel mode

430
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,160
keys

431
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,919
that are uh and and also some security

432
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,720
parameters

433
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
and each key is individually wrapped in

434
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,799
a new structure called direct key

435
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,520
and this uh each key is encrypted in

436
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,400
this structure

437
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,640
using either skd derived key or other

438
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,919
group key

439
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,320
and lkh capacity is now integrated into

440
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
the eq 2

441
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
in such a way that some key encrypted

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
with other key in the same message

443
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
or distributed earlier to this to this

444
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,440
moment so

445
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,520
it can create a key path

446
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,400
decrypting one key with another back to

447
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,799
the

448
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,160
leaf key for this member so it allows to

449
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,200
implement lkh and

450
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
rep key may contain as a group key or

451
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,360
may contain uh individual key for this

452
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,200
subscriber and for example in the

453
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
registration

454
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,840
process with lkh each group member is

455
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,320
provided with its own key

456
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,039
so the next piece

457
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,720
so uh idg load uh

458
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
contains an identity of the group that

459
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,919
you want to join

460
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,039
it's the same format as iq2id

461
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,520
reload and just different payload

462
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,240
in the next place

463
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,720
and we also use some iq to pillows some

464
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
sometimes with slightly different

465
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,760
semantics

466
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,799
so sag it's a safer load which specifies

467
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,360
in which

468
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,360
transforms are supported with algorithm

469
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
and transforms are supported

470
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,559
by a group member so that gcks knows

471
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,600
that

472
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,360
uh which policy is is applicable for

473
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,760
this

474
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,720
he can be applied for this group member

475
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,080
it has the same format

476
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,960
uh it is likely to say pollute but

477
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
slightly different semantics which

478
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,200
allowed to

479
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,360
to specify core dependence of algorithm

480
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,400
in uh

481
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,360
jque 2sa and data security essay and

482
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,679
delete below it is also reduced

483
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,080
and it also has slightly different

484
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,159
semantics because it allows to specify

485
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,120
a zero protocol which means that delete

486
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,840
everything

487
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,879
every say that you have a next piece

488
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,360
so we also have new notifications uh

489
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,480
invalid group id

490
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
authorization failed registration failed

491
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,720
sender it's letters notified that it

492
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
supplies that group member

493
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,679
is uh is willing to send data

494
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,880
so a special semantics is

495
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,120
used in this case because it must be

496
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,320
provided with

497
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,919
separate prefix for counter mode

498
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,600
algorithms so that

499
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,039
several center doesn't uh

500
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,159
have the same count as foreground mode

501
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,200
algorithm and the key is needed is

502
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,679
it's a new notification in zero one

503
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,320
version it is used with ppk

504
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,840
to let uh

505
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,200
dcks uh know

506
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,640
the gm that it must rekey before

507
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,360
some sensitive information is sent over

508
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
this essay

509
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,720
because as we know db key doesn't

510
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,760
uh provide i can say

511
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,559
security against quantum computers until

512
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,080
it is required

513
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,240
so the next please

514
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
so we will also use some micro

515
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,080
jerkification like use transport mode

516
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
but it has slightly different semantics

517
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,320
because it multiple descentification may

518
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,200
be included

519
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,320
in which specifies that

520
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,039
a particular data security security same

521
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,480
must be created in transport mode

522
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,360
because

523
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,720
uh several say can be created

524
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,240
at the same time if they are

525
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,840
interdependent let's say h

526
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,480
and g next please

527
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
so it was very quick and probably not

528
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,550
very

529
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,159
[Music]

530
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,280
good presentation but

531
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,480
my my goal

532
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,240
was to attract your attention to this

533
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,679
document because

534
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,520
you badly need reviews and i think that

535
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,720
it is until we have more reviews

536
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,919
uh i think that it is a bit earlier for

537
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,760
the working group passport

538
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,039
because after major right we received

539
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,000
zero reviews it i was i'm worried about

540
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,880
it

541
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,799
please review because it is an important

542
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,200
document and please comment

543
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,880
because it was major changes

544
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
and we need your opinion thank you

545
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,039
all right so i i would also really like

546
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,679
to

547
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,440
get some people to actually review this

548
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,600
i am actually trying to review it myself

549
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,320
also

550
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,640
soon i haven't actually been able to do

551
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,840
that

552
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,200
is there anybody else who would be

553
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,520
willing to review it like paul or

554
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,760
somebody else or michael who

555
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,840
actually makes some stuff on ip second

556
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,159
zone

557
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,799
yeah i will i will review it okay good

558
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,640
so if you get couple of reviews i think

559
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,159
then we can actually see if it's ready

560
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,600
for the last call or not and

561
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
when we get those reviews we can decide

562
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,279
uh whether we

563
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,440
need to do much some changes or go to

564
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
the last call

565
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
some of these is also a little bit

566
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,000
outside the scope of our

567
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,080
you know expertise like the multicast

568
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,679
officer so we might actually get more

569
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,480
comments on the

570
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,880
idea five last call than working loop

571
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,840
last call

572
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,679
or might get some comments anyways

573
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,159
anyway okay thank you thank you for that

574
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
then i think we will go next the next

575
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,240
presentation is

576
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,480
iptfs spacecraft

577
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,440
christian are you there okay see

578
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
okay okay that's

579
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,918
different

580
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,200
aspect ratios you need to scale down the

581
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,679
windows

582
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,880
okay go ahead

583
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,240
yes is the audio yeah okay it looks like

584
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,080
it's working

585
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
okay hi everybody um this is an update

586
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,640
on the ip traffic flow security

587
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
draft which entered last call working

588
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,080
for class call we ran

589
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,158
recently next slide please

590
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,600
um these are the uh updates since 109.

591
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,159
uh 109 we actually were working on o3 so

592
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,840
we've been through a couple of versions

593
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,799
since then uh the big news i guess is

594
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,320
that we cleared the transport area

595
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,039
review

596
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,400
um that was really good that was

597
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,840
the one i was afraid of those can be

598
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,799
tough

599
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,159
um and then we had some pre-working

600
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,440
group last call discussion

601
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
uh valerie talked with valerie about

602
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,559
making the draft a little bit more

603
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,679
generic in its

604
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,679
naming since people had sort of

605
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,799
identified that they

606
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,520
might want to use this outside of iptfs

607
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,880
and

608
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
it wasn't required it maybe makes it a

609
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
little bit easier

610
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,200
or more obvious that you can do that so

611
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,000
we changed the

612
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
identifiers from ipdfs to ag frag

613
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,279
um also fix the

614
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,120
overhead numbers i don't know how i

615
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,960
calculated the ipsec overhead but i got

616
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,080
it wrong

617
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,320
so i fixed that and then changed the

618
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
republican five

619
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
uh part of asking for last call taro did

620
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,360
a nice review

621
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,799
and we published those changes in o6

622
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,600
uh next slide

623
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,480
so we did a three week working week last

624
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,080
call ended last

625
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,120
two to 14 i guess um and we got

626
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,159
a bunch of reviews from tarot

627
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,240
uh that was sort of pre and post

628
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
and then we got a review from sean

629
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,360
turner paul waters

630
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,279
valerie and michael richardson and then

631
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,039
we posted the

632
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,080
an 07 based on all the working group

633
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
last call mail english discussions and

634
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,760
excited talk about those changes

635
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,440
so we had the notable changes uh

636
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,720
were too normative they were minor um

637
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,080
one was sort of clarifying that

638
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
that you shouldn't fragment over

639
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,200
multiple essays

640
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,600
um i don't know if it was clarifying or

641
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,720
just putting it in there

642
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,200
it would have been a bad idea anyway but

643
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,360
it's good to have it be normative

644
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,399
um and also uh

645
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,559
michael richardson had pointed out there

646
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,720
wasn't enough info on uh

647
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,120
packetization layer mtu discovery which

648
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,240
is the

649
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,039
sort of the new recommended way to do

650
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:29,679
pmtud

651
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,760
um i don't know how widely this is

652
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,600
actually implemented

653
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,840
but there's always hope i guess anyway

654
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,120
in in order to do this

655
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,559
um you need a probe packet we have those

656
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,279
so we

657
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,679
in the document we you know point that

658
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,919
out that you use the

659
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,720
congestion control packet says probes

660
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,919
but there's one little

661
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,960
detail deep inside the plmtud

662
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,279
um where it says that congestion control

663
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,399
should not treat

664
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,960
losses due to probing so you know so

665
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,799
think about it if you're sending like a

666
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,520
10k

667
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,799
packet right and it gets dropped

668
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,559
it says that the congestion control

669
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,559
algorithm shouldn't treat that drop as a

670
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,159
loss event

671
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,159
um so there needs to be some way to say

672
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,679
that you know

673
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,080
the algorithm is running currently and

674
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,799
so

675
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,320
i added a p bit for that um but

676
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,960
it's not actually used by you know ag

677
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,360
frag or iptfs but it's just for use by

678
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,840
pl

679
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,039
t p o m t u d um

680
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,159
to say it's in the process of doing that

681
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,960
uh most of the changes were informative

682
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
a lot a lot of editorial cleanup

683
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,000
looks nicer now um organizational

684
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,120
cleanup like splitting

685
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,640
you know bits out into subsections um

686
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,559
like as previous mentioned we changed

687
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,760
iptfs identifiers to ag frag

688
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,240
for on on the wire identifiers um we

689
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,200
expanded the text

690
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,320
on uh the ordering the packet processing

691
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,760
on the receiver

692
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,880
we expanded the text on how uh extra

693
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
padding could be used

694
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,000
to avoid fragmentation that you know and

695
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,360
even mentioned that you know this is

696
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,960
sort of nice because if you lose a

697
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,399
packet

698
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,559
you only you only lose that packet you

699
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,520
would lose a

700
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,760
you know fragmented packet um

701
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,080
also added a section of uh on the

702
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,679
summary of receiver actions

703
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,440
uh you know with internal references

704
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
this came from michael richardson

705
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
because he thought

706
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,000
he thought it would be useful because

707
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,279
there was you know the receiver

708
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,480
processing was sort of in three

709
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,360
different places

710
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
the things you had to note as a receiver

711
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,480
so just

712
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
just a you know section that points at

713
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,159
those three places

714
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,200
um and again i fixed the overhead for

715
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,360
the comparisons and the appendix

716
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
same conclusions that just missed you

717
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
know some bytes

718
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,200
um but it didn't change any anything

719
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,679
because

720
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,159
everything sort of whether using ipdfs

721
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,440
or ipsec

722
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,039
that use the same overhead um

723
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,399
right so next slide

724
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,559
so moving forward we did complete the

725
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,159
working group last call period

726
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,640
i think we've addressed all the reviews

727
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,200
and

728
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
incorporated you know most of the

729
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,240
changes not

730
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,520
everything but most of the changes and

731
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,000
uh

732
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
yeah so wondering if it's ready to go to

733
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,159
the ice sheet

734
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,120
i think that's the last

735
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,000
all slide gallery you're going to have

736
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,320
wrong comments

737
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,120
okay i just uh only want to

738
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,840
explain why i think that more generic

739
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,120
draft

740
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,679
would be better i think that besides

741
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,880
iptfs which

742
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,559
which of course is a primary application

743
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,120
for this mode another very interesting

744
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,559
application for this mod

745
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,200
is an increasing of performance for

746
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
short

747
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,279
tickets because uh when you

748
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,519
use esp for encrypting for protecting

749
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,760
for example war id

750
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,880
which is very short about 20 bytes

751
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,120
we have another hat that is hundreds of

752
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,159
percent

753
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,399
and if you can put several of such

754
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,559
packets into single balloon

755
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,519
which will decrease in overhead of your

756
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,159
tactical

757
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,000
head significantly and uh i feel that

758
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600
it's it's completely a different

759
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,279
application and

760
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,679
if for example somebody decided to write

761
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,000
a draft that explains how to nucleus

762
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,880
mode

763
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,600
for such application it will require to

764
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,000
this

765
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,559
uh resisting epidemic has dropped as a

766
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,240
description of the mod aggregation

767
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
implementation

768
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,480
and when implementer opens uh

769
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,279
this draft it will only see iptfs

770
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,200
repeated as the qtls

771
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,240
so it will think oh it's just a proper

772
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:48,880
use

773
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,039
of a mod that was designed it's

774
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,000
exclusively

775
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
for ibiza trajectory security that's why

776
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,919
i think that

777
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,279
uh it's it's more useful to first define

778
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,679
the mode itself irrigation and

779
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,960
augmentation

780
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,000
and then even in the same document just

781
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,039
with renaming instruction on it and

782
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,440
more accurately choosing awards in each

783
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,240
section

784
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
and then describes it the primary

785
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,600
application is

786
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,480
ip traffic close security but it's not

787
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,159
the only application and the mod

788
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,519
is is is described separately as

789
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,200
it stands alone as usable

790
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,679
right so that that's my opinion why it

791
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:32,159
is usable

792
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,480
so i i do have a response to that we

793
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,519
it's it's not that

794
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,320
so it isn't just an appendix use case of

795
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,039
ag frag

796
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,360
right i mean we have congestion control

797
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,320
and the reason we had

798
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,840
have congestion control and the reason

799
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
we had to go through transparent review

800
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,240
and

801
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
and all of that is is because uh of

802
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,880
congestion control right congestion

803
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,480
control has nothing to do with that crag

804
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,559
it's iptfs it's because we're fire

805
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,240
hosing right we're sending packets at a

806
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
constant rate

807
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,399
and there's a lot of things in here

808
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,120
which are iptfs and we did take you know

809
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
your suggestions about making it generic

810
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,760
including i think three different areas

811
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,600
the abstract the informative and even

812
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,000
another

813
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,240
area where we specifically say you can

814
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,679
use this encapsulation

815
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,880
elsewhere but reorganizing this document

816
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,519
to be a generic with a use case addendum

817
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,159
is

818
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,279
not going to help people implement iptfs

819
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,519
which is the goal it's the chartered you

820
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,880
know feature that we're trying to do

821
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
here and if somebody wants to use it

822
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,399
to improve do improve performance they

823
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,240
can write a document an rfc

824
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,960
a draft that talks about that i don't

825
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,320
think it's going to be hard at all for

826
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,159
an implementer i mean we're talking

827
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,240
about like saying oh should i do this

828
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,000
we specifically say you can do it like

829
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
three different places in a document

830
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
i i don't think reorganizing this helps

831
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,559
iptfs which is what we're trying to do

832
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,480
and which a lot of the documents still

833
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,320
is pertaining to including like i said

834
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,960
the congestion control section

835
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,679
well i agree that some some section of

836
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,600
the document like rotation control is

837
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,360
very specific for pkf

838
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,039
i agree but a section of describing uh

839
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,720
aggregation fragmentation from mark

840
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,879
itself and the section described in the

841
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,480
negotiation of this mod

842
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,199
and the section describing of some

843
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,960
general ingress and angers

844
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
behavior it's it's it's not concerned

845
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,320
with apt

846
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,040
exclusively but those but those are

847
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,399
those sections are there they

848
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,320
we don't we don't call those iptfs

849
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,760
sections

850
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,440
i think this is a minor organizational

851
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,119
thing that will mess up the flow of the

852
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,000
document

853
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,960
and its stated goal just to just for

854
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,800
something that might happen someday i

855
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,119
mean

856
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,079
let it happen someday then sorry sorry

857
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:42,399
but

858
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,280
in every part in every paragraph of this

859
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,839
section

860
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,159
it is called typically it takes place i

861
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,760
would like to

862
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,399
no not every in every second that they

863
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,918
researched

864
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,040
just just more more accurate things well

865
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,119
we took your we took your changes right

866
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,800
i took your changes in the first round

867
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,480
and then you came back with another

868
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,000
round where you want to reorganize the

869
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,839
whole thing to be a different document

870
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,800
and a different

871
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,960
you know title and a different

872
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
everything but it doesn't change between

873
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,440
the world

874
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,920
it's just the structure of the document

875
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,440
and the same thing can be said to your

876
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,000
comment

877
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,680
like that the bits on the wire don't

878
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,920
change right but you're trying to make

879
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,599
like some future work that doesn't even

880
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,440
exist yet maybe be able to be done and

881
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,560
we're trying to

882
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,000
get iptfs done

883
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,000
i think there's uh two things that it's

884
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,720
actually

885
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,079
sometimes it's actually very good to

886
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,320
have a separate you know uh

887
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,440
like like if like we see it then uh

888
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,599
like oaks or intermediate or something

889
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,880
like that it started

890
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,280
inside the one of the you know drafts

891
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,800
then we realized it's actually going to

892
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
be useful for other things and i i think

893
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,839
actually now we already have

894
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,720
some other uses for that and separating

895
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,440
it out

896
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,720
as a completely separate you know

897
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,760
protocol entity is making it easier to

898
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,720
understand

899
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,560
and also easier to implement because

900
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,079
actually one of the things one of the

901
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,920
problem with iptfs is that

902
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
it has been usually the problem because

903
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,200
you have been able to do

904
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,440
similar type of things earlier but

905
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,880
usually people have been you know

906
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,079
hesitant to do that because actually the

907
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:18,960
the you know the

908
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,000
iptfs parts the actually sending the

909
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,160
constant bitrate of things is something

910
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,920
that is very difficult to configure

911
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,960
and and causes all kind of weird things

912
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,800
and i think it's much easier to actually

913
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,240
do the other parts of the

914
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,440
you know uh the aggregation or something

915
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,040
so actually if you think about somebody

916
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
only implementing the receiving end of

917
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,599
this

918
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,079
because in some cases where you have you

919
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,359
have to have a client you have to have

920
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,079
server

921
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,480
doing both of these and i think if you

922
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
have a very clear way to say that okay

923
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,520
this is the receiving end they don't

924
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,000
need to

925
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,960
care about sending you know pockets at a

926
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,000
constant rate

927
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
they just need to be able to understand

928
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
what they get from the

929
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,680
uh from the other end and then if you

930
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,359
have a very good that's why one of the

931
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,320
reasons i think

932
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,520
people are commenting that we need to

933
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,760
have a receiver you know section

934
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,280
separately

935
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,640
so that somebody can only impact the

936
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,000
receiver and because they don't care

937
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,920
about the actual

938
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,440
but we don't love that but daryl you

939
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,560
specifically wouldn't

940
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,040
like you you fought back no it's like

941
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,320
unidirectional

942
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,000
in ice yeah it's completely

943
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,440
what's easy that's what that's why it's

944
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,839
much easier it's uh no we don't

945
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,359
we allow them to be able to send iptf as

946
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
frames in both directions

947
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,880
you don't have to send them in constant

948
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,119
rate in both directions

949
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,079
that's true so so it's completely valid

950
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,760
to make an implementation who receives

951
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,720
ipv

952
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,839
tfs fragments reads these aggregates

953
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,079
separates them out does com everything

954
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,480
correctly but only since

955
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,200
you know if you know fragments that

956
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
don't say constant size fragments yeah

957
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,560
don't aggregate don't uh

958
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,720
fragment them ever because he thinks

959
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,680
that that's actually

960
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,160
that's too much of work for him and

961
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,118
that's why this document

962
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,880
if you actually make it so that we

963
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
actually make it a little bit more

964
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,960
generic

965
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,280
that would be easier to implement in in

966
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,040
in the receiver

967
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
and it is it's already got a summary

968
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,880
section on the receiver right and it's

969
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
very simple

970
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,440
i i think that valerie is looking to

971
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,599
change this document into a generic

972
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,280
encapsulation and i think that's fine if

973
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
that's what the working group wants to

974
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,160
do if they want to get walk away from

975
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,280
iptfs

976
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
and start working on a generic

977
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,400
encapsulation drive no i i i i don't

978
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,800
think

979
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,160
people want to wear the way to ip dfs i

980
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,240
think they want to be able to

981
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,200
see that it's a it's written in a very i

982
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
i don't think they're actually going to

983
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:42,880
be just

984
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,720
annexed it's it's going to be like you

985
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,800
know we have a fire form at first

986
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,960
and then we have the how to use that

987
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,079
wire format

988
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,680
and the wire format includes congestion

989
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,240
control which is iptfs related i

990
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,079
i really think this is this is

991
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,440
stretching we're like

992
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,960
we're going to reorganize the document

993
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,880
it's not going to be a better document

994
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,240
for iptfs

995
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,680
instead it's going to be a document

996
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
about some future use that hasn't been

997
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,040
documented i mean that's not the right

998
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,079
way to do this right

999
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,640
i would actually i would actually

1000
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,440
propose that

1001
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,880
valerie because you have been looking at

1002
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,240
this and you would think would you

1003
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,480
actually make a proposal of you know

1004
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,280
what changes concrete changes what you

1005
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,720
know text you would want to move or

1006
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,400
something like that something like that

1007
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,160
to the list and and then we can see if

1008
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,599
it's if it's

1009
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,680
so big that i don't think you actually

1010
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,640
need to you know

1011
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,160
hash down the you know the actual you

1012
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,400
know text but say that okay taking

1013
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
paragraph one from this

1014
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,119
and paragraph two on here and move a

1015
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,680
little bit around that would be actually

1016
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,440
some kind of indication how big change

1017
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,720
is because i don't think it's actually

1018
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,240
going to be that big

1019
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,599
well i would i would actually like to

1020
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,040
see that i would like to see the text

1021
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,000
because we've already seen

1022
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,680
you know it's easy to point and say

1023
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,359
things move around what i'm claiming is

1024
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,040
that the document itself suffers and

1025
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,079
readability

1026
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,200
and quality yeah but i mean i mean

1027
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,119
having first you know the first round of

1028
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,720
that if hillary says that it's going to

1029
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,400
be way too much he probably just says

1030
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,520
okay this is too much

1031
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,560
work he skips it and then we

1032
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,560
are funny fine with that if he says okay

1033
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,560
it's going to be seven paragraphs here

1034
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,200
moving that

1035
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,720
back and forth then we see that they

1036
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,079
actually brought that much of text and

1037
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,520
then we can see what the actual text is

1038
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,599
going to be

1039
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,760
just trying to get internalized concrete

1040
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,240
steps to go forward

1041
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,160
so would you be willing to do that kind

1042
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,400
of i've already sent

1043
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,319
this message i can resent it it's

1044
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,680
probably without great

1045
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,280
proposals well yeah it says you use

1046
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,800
iptfs everywhere and

1047
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,480
and you should move all this stuff later

1048
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,240
and i that's why i said

1049
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,839
i did say you'd send it already i don't

1050
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,520
think that's enough i think if

1051
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,280
in working last call we want to change

1052
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
this document so heavily

1053
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,640
we should have an example of what that

1054
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,800
looks like

1055
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,839
because i don't think it reads well

1056
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,119
so channeling kind of um

1057
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,960
semi jab ascribing what's in the chat in

1058
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,640
case people have missed that

1059
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,079
um so uh ben um

1060
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,800
notes that um there's another instance

1061
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,359
of

1062
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,359
um a specific use case being included in

1063
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,960
a single document and that making it

1064
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
awkward when other drafts wanted to use

1065
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,880
that framework but not the other parts

1066
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,200
as tereno noted earlier

1067
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,000
um paul's view bit late to totally

1068
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,240
reorganize the document

1069
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,640
mike richardson disagrees with making it

1070
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,680
generic and

1071
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,280
unless and until there's a second use

1072
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,440
case uh

1073
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,640
paul there is a second use case

1074
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,599
uh mike don't mind valerie writing a

1075
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,280
this document or a book explaining stuff

1076
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,000
but doesn't want this

1077
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,839
document held up so there's a fair

1078
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,839
amount of to and fro in the chat there

1079
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,040
let's keep in mind too that that it

1080
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,280
already is easy to read for other use

1081
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,839
cases

1082
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,079
i mean this is i i think i think this

1083
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,440
goes this goes too far

1084
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,000
because it's not confusing to read this

1085
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,920
document and know how to use it outside

1086
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,040
of iptfs

1087
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,800
i i don't agree with it i don't agree

1088
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,359
with valerie on that so i i i i actually

1089
00:41:59,359 --> 00:41:59,839
have

1090
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,599
when i was reading it in the beginning i

1091
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,760
i had very hard time of understanding

1092
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,160
some of the ipfdfs stuff

1093
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,920
i haven't read the radius track this was

1094
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,160
the prior the stuff i read i

1095
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,720
understand some of these about actually

1096
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,599
but uh

1097
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,640
but i i mean it's

1098
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,280
it wasn't that easy at that point you

1099
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,960
know and i mean with that that i did

1100
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,400
we did make a bunch of changes that

1101
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,599
valerie asked for to make it more

1102
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,200
generic right to point out the

1103
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,839
things okay

1104
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,240
i might have ran over but that's so i

1105
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,599
think uh

1106
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,440
lulu oh we have more people i think that

1107
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,040
we have other comments so

1108
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,800
or do you have anything else whatever i

1109
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,640
don't think you are yeah i wanted to

1110
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,240
mention that i thought the

1111
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
characterization of the conversation in

1112
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,599
jabber was incorrect

1113
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,319
uh just whoever said that there was

1114
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,680
going back and forth

1115
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,079
but i see three comments that they don't

1116
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,720
wait

1117
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,079
i don't see anyone saying wait so

1118
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,560
yeah there was there's discussion but

1119
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,200
you know

1120
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,880
we have paul saying it's late to

1121
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,880
reorganize we have

1122
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,920
uh uh michael saying uh basically the

1123
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,680
same thing i said plus one but you know

1124
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,200
i am a contributor on it so yeah i'm

1125
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,160
biased

1126
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,000
uh but i i don't think anybody wants to

1127
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,680
wait

1128
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,119
wait would mean that we wouldn't do

1129
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,359
anything until something happens

1130
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,240
i think people want to work on the draft

1131
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,800
and get it out as soon as possible

1132
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,640
i don't think actually you know changing

1133
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,839
it to the you know

1134
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,240
this kind of thing is actually that many

1135
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,400
hours of work

1136
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,160
so so we are not talking about waiting

1137
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,920
for two weeks or three weeks or

1138
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,440
something like that i wanted this to go

1139
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,000
out very

1140
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,119
quickly but i want to also be to be

1141
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,040
best possible documents we have so

1142
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,599
that's why i was you know

1143
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,200
that's why i'm saying that if valerie

1144
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,720
can actually work on this uh

1145
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,240
quickly then we can go on forward if if

1146
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,839
if he thinks that he can't do it in

1147
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,000
early quickly enough then

1148
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,359
then we go forward with this one that's

1149
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,598
great

1150
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,480
thank you lauren apologies there were

1151
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,000
indeed um

1152
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,359
several comments uh in in favor of not

1153
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,640
um not delaying this further

1154
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,680
um there's also a further comment from

1155
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,040
mike richardson um mike if you have

1156
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:23,920
audio

1157
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,680
could you possibly expand that because

1158
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,760
uh mike's comment is it's a ps when the

1159
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,280
second use case comes along

1160
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,720
restructure it for ies

1161
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,079
it's a proposed standard i'm not sure if

1162
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:36,720
i'm being here

1163
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
heard it's a proposal yes you are

1164
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,760
proposed

1165
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,640
not post script yeah it's a proposed

1166
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,680
standard

1167
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,960
um and uh the the

1168
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,280
bar for that's already too high and

1169
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,319
if a second use case comes along

1170
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,480
then some we can write some more

1171
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,000
documents

1172
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,280
and can do abyss and

1173
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,880
that will be a much more efficient use

1174
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,720
of the ietf's time than

1175
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,760
waiting right

1176
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,680
and i'll give you an example of 81 rfc

1177
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,640
8152

1178
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,680
there

1179
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,119
thanks mike and there is a reply from

1180
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,040
ben to the effect he thought that

1181
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,599
two of the 81 52 bis documents were not

1182
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,560
internet standards

1183
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,400
sorry can't turn off the pedanticism

1184
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,079
today

1185
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,839
it is day one after all

1186
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,119
all right so so

1187
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,839
my proposal is to wait for you know to

1188
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,280
the

1189
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,319
uh wait i valerie working on this uh to

1190
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:46,880
get the

1191
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,800
concrete proposal what would be to

1192
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,079
change this to be

1193
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,839
to be done to the draft uh

1194
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,599
in i would say

1195
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,839
end of next week something like that

1196
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,359
yeah it's good

1197
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,240
and and then then i would actually also

1198
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:04,880
because we

1199
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,480
before we go forward we need to have a

1200
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,240
you know other other things going on

1201
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,599
with we will start

1202
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,240
simultaneously going on which will be

1203
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,000
delaying something

1204
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,240
for for for us anyway we have some works

1205
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,839
to do with outers and so on

1206
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,920
so we will work on that at the same time

1207
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,040
simultaneously so this

1208
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,960
shouldn't be delaying anything of this

1209
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,240
going forward i don't think it's

1210
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,359
actually going to

1211
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
change any of this safar write up or

1212
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,480
anything like that

1213
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,560
regardless what we do with this actual

1214
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,340
text

1215
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,480
[Music]

1216
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,920
all right so uh just one other thing um

1217
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,480
when people come to the mike and well

1218
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,000
they don't come to the mic

1219
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,400
when they open the mic and um talk

1220
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,920
please state your name because

1221
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,640
later when you watch youtube recordings

1222
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,240
you can't tell who's talking

1223
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,400
you don't see who's talking so please

1224
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,000
state your name as if we were

1225
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,359
in a physical meeting thank you that was

1226
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,000
good comment

1227
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,400
i i should have i remember to say that

1228
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,319
myself i should have said my name also

1229
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,880
at some point

1230
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,960
so that was there okay i'm talking all

1231
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,160
right anything else of this topic or or

1232
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,040
any other comments

1233
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,079
all right yeah one one um technical

1234
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,319
update uh um one participant

1235
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,800
one participant uh reported that the uh

1236
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,000
the audio streaming

1237
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,960
feed wasn't working um so i've opened a

1238
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,119
ticket for it and i've had a response

1239
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,440
they have identified the source of the

1240
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,960
problem and

1241
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,880
it's only it's only affecting ipsec me

1242
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,960
sorry about that they are working to fix

1243
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,640
it before the end of this session for us

1244
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,240
the ideal stream wasn't secure enough

1245
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
yeah they should have been using ipsec

1246
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,079
and the question there is of course it

1247
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,720
hopefully is still going to be recorded

1248
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,160
and

1249
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,079
i mean i i don't think that many people

1250
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,000
are using the direct audio

1251
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
stream as long as the me take works and

1252
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
if it's going to be recorded correctly

1253
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:56,559
that's

1254
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,960
that's you know good enough if they can

1255
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,599
always

1256
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,880
check check it out later and okay

1257
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,839
so any other things about this topic

1258
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,160
if not i think we move forward which was

1259
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,440
actually questions or comments and then

1260
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,960
we have the management

1261
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,920
young adoption and update new snmp draft

1262
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,000
stuff

1263
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,280
this is is it still crystal or something

1264
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,599
else

1265
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,599
somebody else okay zombie

1266
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,800
all right good go ahead and say just for

1267
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,200
whenever

1268
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,839
when i need to go for one slice okay can

1269
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,839
you hear me

1270
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,520
can you hear me yes i can hear you you

1271
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,880
probably didn't see

1272
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,960
so hi hi uh don fettick here uh laban

1273
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,000
consulting

1274
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,040
um so this is the uh uh the yang model

1275
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,520
for

1276
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,640
ip traffic set uh flow security

1277
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,520
next slide please

1278
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,359
so um we we had some updates based on

1279
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:00,000
the

1280
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,200
working group um adoption call and

1281
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,559
um we reorganized the statistics um

1282
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,960
to separate inner and outer stats a bit

1283
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,240
better

1284
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,440
um we added a max aggregation time as a

1285
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,880
as a control option and

1286
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,079
we've uh we're built on top of uh

1287
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,359
the yang for i2 nsf which is a

1288
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,839
more a complete ipsec uh

1289
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,920
yang for ike and iklis and stuff like

1290
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,319
that

1291
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,000
so because we're built on top of that

1292
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,319
we're augmenting it if they change any

1293
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,000
names and stuff like that

1294
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,119
uh the test files that we have

1295
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,520
um require updating so we did that

1296
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:48,640
um and uh

1297
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,280
the the current version is zero two

1298
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,880
we're going to change that to the

1299
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,280
working group zero zero version as soon

1300
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,720
as it's available to do that

1301
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,760
next chart

1302
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,960
so this is just uh a snapshot of the

1303
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,559
tree for the ike version

1304
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,200
the iklas version is very similar it's

1305
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,680
just

1306
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,079
in a in a slightly different place sorry

1307
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,760
it's a bit of a

1308
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,520
i chart test but it just shows the

1309
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,079
organization

1310
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,119
um of the management parameters and

1311
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,440
the the readout of those on the left

1312
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,160
side

1313
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,800
and then the statistics so there's some

1314
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,359
generic

1315
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,160
ip sex statistics at the top and then

1316
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,960
the inner packet and outer packet

1317
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,680
statistics

1318
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,480
next chart

1319
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,760
so uh next steps um

1320
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,960
track any changes in the base uh i

1321
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,720
ipsec uh iptfs uh specification make

1322
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,599
sure that we're up

1323
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,359
um to speed on that uh solicit

1324
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,160
feedback from the work group uh we we

1325
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,640
you know

1326
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,079
like comments anything um we are

1327
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,720
we we have running code for iptfs and we

1328
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,440
are

1329
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,880
um implementing this yang as well

1330
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,000
so uh

1331
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,559
next chart

1332
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,599
so um along with that um

1333
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,839
we're also implementing um a

1334
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,400
snmp version for management objects

1335
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,920
so next chart

1336
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,760
so we we wanted to provide a read-only

1337
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,280
snmp nib

1338
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,559
in the in for the same objects

1339
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,119
so we have requirements some operators

1340
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:43,920
still

1341
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,760
require snmp support

1342
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,400
and we we try it as much as possible to

1343
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,240
mechanically derive that

1344
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,440
from the yang model um there's not a

1345
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,040
program to do it but

1346
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,920
it's a one-for-one type of mapping and i

1347
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,400
i

1348
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,200
just showed an example here of the um

1349
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,440
the layer two fixed rate what it looks

1350
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,200
like in yang and what it looks like

1351
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,200
in snmp

1352
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,559
next chart so

1353
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,240
um the the tool like this snmi tools uh

1354
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,880
also summarizes the the mib in sort of

1355
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,520
an organization that looks a lot like

1356
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,680
the the yang tree so i thought that was

1357
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,720
useful

1358
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,160
and uh we've captured that in the

1359
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,720
document as well as the mib

1360
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,599
definitions and so this just shows the

1361
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,440
the organization

1362
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,520
and if you looked at the yang tree you

1363
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,640
would find that there's

1364
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,720
a pretty high correlation between the

1365
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,959
two

1366
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,160
uh next chart

1367
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,720
so we we'd also like to adopt this as a

1368
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,440
a

1369
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,480
working group document

1370
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,720
um and so i think that's basically it

1371
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,839
any comments or questions

1372
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,559
well you have neuro speaking with no

1373
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,240
hats well maybe the i2 and sf chair head

1374
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,000
you mentioned the um sdn ipsec flow

1375
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,440
uh general flow thing so

1376
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,319
that just passed the isg it's approved

1377
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:22,800
it's

1378
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,839
uh still a revised id needed but uh

1379
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,240
this should no longer be a moving target

1380
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,640
from now on thank you

1381
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,160
mike richardson has a question in the

1382
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:40,399
chat will this be ipsec this first yang

1383
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,839
document

1384
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,280
and lou replies yes

1385
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,760
i think i think to that question i i

1386
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,880
think we have seen

1387
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,280
other young documents before we have

1388
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,480
never published any

1389
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,440
i think we have seen a couple of

1390
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,240
management

1391
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,720
you know documents coming i'm going and

1392
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,160
usually they just

1393
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,240
come and people are interested and then

1394
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,760
people are realizing that

1395
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,680
they can't really use them that much

1396
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:08,960
that they go away

1397
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,160
but hopefully this would be the first

1398
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,640
one that's actually going to be used

1399
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,240
and pop that's an rfc

1400
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,520
and ben has a follow-up clarification

1401
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,640
about 8152 bis he says

1402
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,960
for the 81 52-bit situation 81 52 bis

1403
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,480
strzok is an internet standard 82 81 52

1404
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:32,800
bis

1405
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,760
algs is informational and draft ietf

1406
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,880
cozy counter sign

1407
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,880
is newer functionality and is going for

1408
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,960
proposed standard if i recall correctly

1409
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,359
paul vargas says we reviewed the nsf

1410
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,759
ones

1411
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,920
alright so i think that's

1412
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,640
uh so so i is there any other comments

1413
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,839
on this uh

1414
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,558
these documents

1415
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,040
and it was just adopted as a working

1416
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,280
group comment so i would hope people

1417
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,880
could document so i would hope people

1418
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,559
actually review it and

1419
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,880
and my understanding is that there is

1420
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,559
also if there's

1421
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,400
so i don't think there's it's now up to

1422
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,680
date with the

1423
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,640
you know uh currently iptfs and the

1424
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,520
current uh

1425
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,440
other documents right yeah okay so so so

1426
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,079
it there shouldn't be you know any

1427
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,079
any anything to requiring it to be

1428
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,440
updated

1429
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,760
uh there is also i don't think there's

1430
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,599
that much hurry with this one than that

1431
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,920
than the iptfs so i think we actually

1432
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,720
try to get iptfs out first and then push

1433
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,119
this

1434
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:41,200
after iptfs because i don't think

1435
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,960
there's any need to keep them

1436
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,240
in sync or keep them i think the iptfs

1437
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,559
is more important

1438
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,440
yeah we probably want to do uh we'll

1439
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,839
probably ask for a um

1440
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:58,000
adoption call on the third the the mib

1441
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,200
oh yeah that's actually true that's

1442
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,280
actually one of the but i

1443
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,599
i i understand that most of the stuff we

1444
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,960
are now doing with young and we are not

1445
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,640
doing any meeps anymore but uh

1446
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,119
yeah it's unfortunate it's unfortunate

1447
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,559
that people they they only need breed

1448
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,000
only mibs but they still

1449
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
require you know out in the real world

1450
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,680
they're still using us an mp

1451
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,200
yeah okay so so i can actually start and

1452
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,400
you know

1453
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,480
uh working group because i think it goes

1454
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,920
to the same category

1455
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,200
and the current you know

1456
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,720
and i'm really surprised that you don't

1457
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,559
have a tool to actually make a young

1458
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,160
vape from the young because i think you

1459
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,520
should actually that would be better

1460
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,160
often

1461
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,000
you write a tool that actually takes a

1462
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,920
younger model out and makes amiibo out

1463
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,280
of that because i think it should be

1464
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,710
completely automatic process

1465
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:56,240
[Laughter]

1466
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,119
don used john used one and it's it just

1467
00:56:59,119 --> 00:56:59,599
doesn't

1468
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,760
it needs some hand holding so he

1469
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,520
actually did use a tool that like did

1470
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,960
the initial work but then he had to

1471
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,799
clean it up

1472
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,799
yeah ben

1473
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:13,280
uh yeah i was just gonna chime in as

1474
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,200
well about using an automated tool

1475
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,079
uh because you know it's sort of easier

1476
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,000
to have more confidence in the results

1477
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,400
especially if there is some change to

1478
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,680
the yang model

1479
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,760
that you then have to try and propagate

1480
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,240
into the snmp mib

1481
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,040
yeah that's why i mentioned don took it

1482
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,799
out of this presentation but he did

1483
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,200
start with an automated tool so

1484
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,839
um it just had some cleanup to do on it

1485
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:38,480
afterwards

1486
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,559
i i was actually thinking about if if

1487
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,400
there's some things that are missing

1488
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,119
from the tool

1489
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,000
or something that we should hopefully

1490
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,240
see

1491
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,640
that augmented if there is i think i

1492
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,680
mean some of those

1493
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,920
probably need to run like special cases

1494
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,280
in some of the things but

1495
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,280
then we could have just a configuration

1496
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,960
file so that this is the configuration

1497
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,160
files we are using for

1498
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,799
automatically generate this using these

1499
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:02,240
special cases but

1500
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,400
anyway okay that's not our hackathon

1501
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,079
hackathon in november yeah i was

1502
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,200
thinking about that actually would be

1503
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,400
something that useful to have a

1504
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,440
hackathon

1505
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,319
or or something like idf tools but okay

1506
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:13,520
all right so

1507
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,480
if not anything nothing else about this

1508
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,000
i think we go to the next uh

1509
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,280
presentation which is

1510
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,640
uh iphone 2 configuration for encrypted

1511
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,280
dns

1512
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,760
valerie

1513
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,200
hi well there is a slow file is plus

1514
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,400
so uh it's a presentation

1515
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,880
uh repeated presentation about ip2

1516
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,799
configuration for encrypted dns

1517
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,680
so the next please

1518
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,200
so uh the last time it was presented

1519
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,960
in iitv iphone 9 and

1520
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,880
discussed it was discussed in adoption

1521
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,960
possible adoption of this draft

1522
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,240
and the comments raised

1523
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,040
where that please wait for apd working

1524
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,079
group to progress

1525
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:08,000
before adoption in episode me and

1526
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,480
since that atg working group has

1527
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,160
progressed far enough to reconsider the

1528
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,760
adoption of this draft in the second

1529
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,359
year

1530
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,599
because addg working group adopted

1531
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,520
insecure discovery mechanisms

1532
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,839
like dhcp rotary advertisement and dns

1533
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,200
and so this draft has no conflict with

1534
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,160
the book

1535
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,960
in add working group and of course we

1536
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,559
will commit to cross review this

1537
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:33,200
document

1538
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,078
in engineering group so the next piece

1539
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:41,359
so from previous version uh there were

1540
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,640
some changes

1541
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,480
first a new attribute was introduced and

1542
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,680
and is variety blade

1543
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,640
it is used for uh transferring

1544
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,920
overriding plates

1545
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:57,520
for dennis over at appears and

1546
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,680
it was also done some qualification on

1547
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,720
our authentication

1548
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,400
private equipped dns servers so i was

1549
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,160
encrypted in a server hosted by the

1550
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,839
provider can get to the main available

1551
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,319
certificate from a public series

1552
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,839
but it is only accessibility and

1553
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,359
connected to the bin

1554
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,240
it was a qualification so the next piece

1555
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,960
so it's a format for a new

1556
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,160
attribute and this will write a blade

1557
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,319
it consists of several

1558
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:31,119
all right template data from which it

1559
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,040
says

1560
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,720
simple structure length and plate

1561
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:42,400
next piece

1562
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,760
for doh specifics uh

1563
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,680
uh server may support more than your

1564
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,799
writing play

1565
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,200
so if uh is requested the national

1566
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,280
initiative includes an empty

1567
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,160
and then us writing plate attribute in

1568
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,680
addition to english

1569
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,599
ip 4 or ip6

1570
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,599
doh attribute in the cafe request

1571
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,839
and if the respondent includes uh dns

1572
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:12,240
ip4 joke or and then safety fixed dog in

1573
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,040
the response

1574
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,720
it must also increase and they need to

1575
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,440
write a plate carrying one or more right

1576
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,799
that's very simple and uh

1577
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:22,960
these mechanism voids need to rely on

1578
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,280
security discovery mechanism like gcp or

1579
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,200
rotated advancement

1580
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,720
and on dns

1581
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,799
or port 53 which requires additional rtt

1582
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,359
and it is not always secure since then

1583
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,079
the sec is not one data

1584
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,240
it's described in dropped schwarzenberg

1585
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,319
0-1 so the next please

1586
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,440
so that's all and i also think that uh

1587
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,880
we can reconcile the adoption of this

1588
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:07,839
document in a second group

1589
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,960
yes paul

1590
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,240
no audio

1591
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,799
you can see

1592
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,839
paul we are not hearing you

1593
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,119
that's very strange now we can hear you

1594
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,559
hello yeah we can hear you

1595
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,599
okay very strange okay um so i read the

1596
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:40,480
document

1597
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,160
um and i i find that it it's it's

1598
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,359
it's mixing up provisioning and

1599
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:49,599
ike protocol like where with ike

1600
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,480
protocol

1601
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,480
you hand out information from the server

1602
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,839
you have a client server trust

1603
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,119
relationship

1604
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,039
um and that's how you authenticate the

1605
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,640
information and what

1606
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,039
what this does is like somewhere in

1607
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,000
between provisioning

1608
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,440
where you so you don't hard code the dns

1609
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,200
servers in a provisioning profile you

1610
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,520
you allow them to be specified in ike

1611
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,440
but then all of the authentication of

1612
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,720
them like

1613
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,359
uh is is left out of the document is not

1614
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:17,119
mentioned in the security considerations

1615
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:17,760
how

1616
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,200
how that works and uh and it even says

1617
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,559
scary things like oh you might

1618
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,799
authenticate the tls server of the

1619
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:27,599
you know the dns server over web pci

1620
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,200
using a public certificate from the

1621
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,839
internet that the server got previously

1622
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,799
i find that really scary i would really

1623
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,920
want to see a way where the ike server

1624
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,599
can convey the certificate used

1625
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,280
to authenticate the dns server if the

1626
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,960
dns server is using a certificate

1627
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,520
because

1628
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,680
we are ike we are the authoritative

1629
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,280
source of information for these things

1630
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,400
and so

1631
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,400
sourcing that out to somewhere on the

1632
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,119
world or like let's encrypt seems like a

1633
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:57,440
dangerous proposition to make

1634
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,599
um i also have some minor things but

1635
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:00,720
that i'll

1636
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,559
i'll bring those to the list but but my

1637
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,920
my big concern is that

1638
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,280
you really need to be able to have this

1639
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,119
as a standalone system where

1640
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,200
you can send a certificate along with

1641
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,599
the specification of the door or dot or

1642
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:12,240
your

1643
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,640
servers

1644
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,400
well uh thank you for a comment and i

1645
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,039
think that

1646
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,640
it's it can be an improvement to the

1647
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,640
draft that

1648
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,520
of course the draft is not perfect and

1649
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,119
if the working group decides that you

1650
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,240
just still want to

1651
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,440
work on it i think that these changes

1652
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,960
can be discussed probably

1653
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:42,480
okay uh tommy

1654
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,400
all right can you hear me yes we can

1655
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,599
okay yeah so thanks for sharing this and

1656
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,559
thanks for the

1657
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:53,359
updates i agree with paul that it would

1658
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,480
be nice to see

1659
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,359
a bit more strong authentication in here

1660
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:58,960
however i think

1661
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,920
this is something that we could adopt in

1662
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,319
the group

1663
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:05,200
i think it is ready for that um

1664
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,960
regarding the relationship to add

1665
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,200
it essentially seems to be

1666
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,880
the same as the uh dnr

1667
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,119
document in there which is the dhcp just

1668
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,160
kind of taking those

1669
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,200
exact formats and stuffing them

1670
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,319
into the ike attributes

1671
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:26,319
so i think i think that's fine you're

1672
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:27,839
essentially just saving

1673
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,799
the round trip of also doing dhcp over

1674
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,559
the tunnel and you're going to have it

1675
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:33,920
have more opportunities to have more

1676
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:35,760
authenticated information

1677
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,960
it may be good to kind of specifically

1678
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,400
call over to that document

1679
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,200
and highlight that relationship that

1680
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:43,920
you're going to kind of

1681
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,640
try to keep those formats aligned if

1682
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,599
that's the intention

1683
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,839
which i think would make sense

1684
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:54,880
a couple of comments from the chat

1685
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,400
mohamed booker they're

1686
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,799
responding to paul paul's concerns that

1687
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,079
these are the kind of things that can be

1688
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,480
worked out when adopted

1689
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,280
and then scott flora um again replying

1690
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:05,760
to paul

1691
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,200
how you get a certificate is not

1692
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,280
security important it's how to verify

1693
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,599
the cert

1694
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:14,880
and then mohammed um just uh concurring

1695
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,599
with tommy's

1696
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,599
uh tommy's comment

1697
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:24,640
all right okay michael

1698
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,960
hi um so i had read the document i think

1699
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,920
previous rev um and i followed a lot of

1700
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,359
the add

1701
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,960
stuff um and even though a lot of noise

1702
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,480
um i i don't think feel that add has

1703
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,920
uh progressed far enough for

1704
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,880
us to reasonably say um answer any of

1705
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,960
paul's questions for instance

1706
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,480
um and i think that that working group

1707
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:52,960
is

1708
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,079
actively trying to do that problem um so

1709
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,920
the things that paul said he felt were

1710
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,839
scary yeah would be completely scary if

1711
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,760
you were doing them

1712
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,520
with just this document in no other

1713
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,000
context whatsoever

1714
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,760
so i don't actually think we should

1715
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,359
adopt this document i actually think

1716
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,280
that add should adopt this document and

1717
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,200
we should review it

1718
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,200
because i really think that the the

1719
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,119
question as was said in chat

1720
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,880
about how do you verify these

1721
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,280
certificates and what do they mean

1722
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,079
that's really what addd is really in

1723
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,160
some sense trying to solve

1724
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,280
um and so whatever solution they come up

1725
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:29,760
with

1726
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,880
this document would need to be in in uh

1727
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:33,839
synchronous

1728
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,039
with so i would say that no we should

1729
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,960
not adopt it we should strongly suggest

1730
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,720
that this should happen in edd

1731
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,839
with our review

1732
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,480
well i think that

1733
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,760
the document is

1734
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,000
one kind of cross area documents as it

1735
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,319
is

1736
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:01,680
always difficult to uh

1737
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,160
to decide which era it must be adopted

1738
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,200
in

1739
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:10,240
so probably addie is also a good option

1740
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,000
for trying to adopt uh the drought

1741
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,839
here there but as far as i remember the

1742
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:19,359
last time we tried to

1743
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,839
present it well it was it was i think it

1744
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,279
was uh

1745
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,799
in july to ask for adoption

1746
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,640
they deserve that well

1747
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,198
it's not uh concerned with abd it's

1748
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,238
specific

1749
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,399
with uh it was something like that

1750
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:43,759
so probably you can try again

1751
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,439
um i think we generally try to avoid

1752
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:49,920
having

1753
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,719
other working groups defining um ike

1754
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,198
payloads but

1755
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:57,600
i guess uh if something's really

1756
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,759
different about this one

1757
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,359
it makes more sense that they'll tell us

1758
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,120
what the content should be and then

1759
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,319
we do the formatting because documents

1760
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,359
usually

1761
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,880
do the formatting so i i agree on that i

1762
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,560
think i think we want to keep that

1763
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,719
we make the we make the payloads and so

1764
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,799
on but i think we already have done that

1765
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,839
i think the document already has those

1766
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,560
things uh

1767
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,600
specified okay the scent the semantics

1768
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,040
of what they what they are meaning

1769
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,679
is uh what i think i don't or what paul

1770
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,198
do you have any concerns about the

1771
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,640
actual bits on the

1772
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,799
wire or do you actually have only what

1773
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,799
the semantics of the meaning of these

1774
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,120
bits

1775
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,960
does audio now great okay um sorry so so

1776
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,600
actually

1777
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,120
i i do have some other issues so for

1778
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,439
instance section three is

1779
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,080
a section about deployment examples and

1780
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,839
things and that goes into the same

1781
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,439
trouble that the entire working group

1782
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,560
has is that

1783
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,560
people don't even agree on whether the

1784
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,080
working group should tackle all of that

1785
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,280
space i would just

1786
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,800
remove all of section three from the

1787
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,880
document and just specify the payloads

1788
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,679
and not

1789
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,600
any of the politics on where what should

1790
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,040
be going

1791
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,520
or what the use cases are because you

1792
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,520
know you're just relaying these very

1793
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,760
specific technical concepts from the ike

1794
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,120
layer

1795
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,480
but the other thing i wanted to to

1796
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,400
clarify is like i spent a lot of time

1797
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:18,800
with

1798
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,920
um with tommy on

1799
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,199
the split dns rfc

1800
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,600
because the dls working group and the

1801
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,400
web pki

1802
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,600
people were really concerned about the

1803
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,280
change of trust anchors when you

1804
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:33,920
redirect

1805
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,159
dnsx server to something under your

1806
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,760
control and this document is actually

1807
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,960
doing that

1808
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,120
and the phrasing around split dns is

1809
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,719
also kind of dangerous like

1810
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:45,840
if i set up a split dns then

1811
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:49,199
can i get google.com you know uh

1812
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,440
dns sec trust anchors and do other

1813
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,400
things um

1814
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,480
the there's there's a serious security

1815
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,920
consideration section that should be

1816
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,120
written there

1817
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,040
and should be reviewed by the web pki

1818
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,280
people again just like you did for the

1819
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,280
split dns rfc and i think the security

1820
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,640
consecutive right now

1821
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:13,840
is just a really bad placeholder

1822
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,920
all right so uh ben

1823
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,040
yeah hi this is ben kaydock i wanted to

1824
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,159
reply to paul

1825
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:25,760
i guess twice now so uh at the beginning

1826
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,440
when we were talking about

1827
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,760
you know conveying the certificate in

1828
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,640
ike

1829
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,520
versus having a web pki certificate for

1830
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:34,000
the

1831
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,600
doh server uh i think that

1832
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,520
for https there's a pretty well-defined

1833
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,280
semantics for how you authenticate

1834
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:48,239
an https server and what constitutes

1835
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,199
being an authority for a given url

1836
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,760
so i don't think that we should try to

1837
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,320
override or respecify that

1838
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,760
and the only interesting parts

1839
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:03,040
depend on what trust anchors are in the

1840
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,120
trust store of the client

1841
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,640
and you know maybe if we wanted to do

1842
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,000
something in this space we would be

1843
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,600
talking about

1844
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,760
conveying the trust anchor that you want

1845
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,679
to use or perhaps

1846
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,440
forcing the specific and entity

1847
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,360
certificate as a way of

1848
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,640
trusting the leaf directly

1849
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,199
and that gets back into the the second

1850
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:24,239
point that you were making

1851
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,320
about the security considerations and

1852
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,360
interacting with

1853
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,000
the web dki and getting the review from

1854
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,080
that so i definitely agree

1855
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,920
we need to get the security

1856
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,199
considerations reviewed

1857
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:38,320
for the pki stuff

1858
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,679
and if we're changing the

1859
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,360
the usage of the web pki as you

1860
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,239
described

1861
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:54,640
all right so uh i think we have to be

1862
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,640
going forward on this big soon uh

1863
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,120
one of the things i i was thinking about

1864
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,640
uh

1865
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,040
we do want to you know review this and i

1866
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,760
think we actually want to you know

1867
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,320
have people to actually work on this in

1868
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,199
ipsec

1869
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:15,360
me so because i i still think that it

1870
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,199
actually probably would be

1871
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:18,719
either we actually just published the

1872
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:20,640
you know the raw

1873
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,199
bits on the wire and and then the add

1874
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,760
defines

1875
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,080
what they are you know used for or we

1876
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,440
just you know

1877
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,040
head it back to the add to add the

1878
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:33,040
police stuff that what they want

1879
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,440
but i don't think we can actually you

1880
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,440
know so so i would actually want people

1881
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,679
to actually review this document anyway

1882
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,400
and get more comments on it and and and

1883
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,600
then we can actually start thinking

1884
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,280
about uh

1885
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,520
whether it must be adopted here and

1886
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,480
they're very

1887
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,320
very very should be actually published

1888
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,760
because i think they're actually we get

1889
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,600
we can we can work on this

1890
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,080
in the working group and then hand it

1891
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,880
over to the

1892
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,040
you know the add working group also

1893
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,880
so i i'm not sure which one will be best

1894
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,159
now and i don't think we actually can

1895
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,719
solve it now

1896
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,719
so our proposal is that people will

1897
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,320
review this and send comments to the

1898
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,360
list and and

1899
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,320
let's let's make it good for our point

1900
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:18,640
of view and then see

1901
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,159
where we are going to be publishing it

1902
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:24,639
or how we're going to work for one

1903
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,280
paul and michael you still have some

1904
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,840
comments on this

1905
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,880
let's do i need a queue or are you still

1906
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,920
leftovers in the queue

1907
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,000
i still had a a comment that that i

1908
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,920
mostly agreed with paul that

1909
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,760
i thought that the document if it's

1910
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,960
going to say

1911
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,360
go into the policy then it needs to be

1912
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,560
an add

1913
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,360
if you want rip out on just do protocols

1914
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,120
if we really feel strongly that

1915
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,600
that only the ipsec me working group

1916
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,000
could possibly

1917
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,360
uh publish the bits on the wire

1918
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,800
um then fine in which case the document

1919
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,560
says too much

1920
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,400
but will probably then fail a security

1921
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,760
review when it doesn't have the rest of

1922
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,080
the

1923
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:15,440
the content in it so um

1924
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,560
i guess your plan is good one um that we

1925
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,320
should do more work but i just think

1926
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,159
that we're gonna get nowhere

1927
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,560
until add actually uh gives us a

1928
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,199
document to point at for the rest of it

1929
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,760
now i agree on that that i don't think

1930
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,120
you can actually publish this before the

1931
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,280
add desires things but we can work on it

1932
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,760
and we can make it so that actually is

1933
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,360
as i said we want to be able to be

1934
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,360
you know check out all the bits that we

1935
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:43,440
are putting in direct version 2.

1936
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,440
i don't necessarily require them to be

1937
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,440
published in ipsec may i want to have

1938
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,760
us to have a proper review on that and i

1939
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,040
want to have that reviewed up

1940
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,800
we can do that review before the add

1941
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,520
gets its work done

1942
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:57,199
so we can get the bits of the bits

1943
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,080
proper before the add gets their

1944
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:03,679
stuff working all right so

1945
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,360
if nothing else i think we go to the

1946
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,719
next one which is

1947
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:10,560
valerie with the new payload format for

1948
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,280
right version 2.

1949
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,800
well uh again well there is no slope for

1950
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,000
this

1951
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,080
and i want to tell a little bit about

1952
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,000
the possible new format for ipad

1953
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,480
next please

1954
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,080
so what problems uh do we have with

1955
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:35,280
current formats

1956
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,760
i think there are at least two uh things

1957
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,400
that

1958
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,679
make it not very good for some

1959
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:42,800
application

1960
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,960
but it contains a lot of redundancy

1961
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,280
and many pillows contains a lot of zeros

1962
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:55,600
and uh lens occupies always occupies two

1963
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,719
octets and but while uh most balloons

1964
01:16:58,719 --> 01:16:59,199
are

1965
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:02,880
short and most parameters compared to

1966
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,600
bytes

1967
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,199
and uh we actually allocate

1968
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:11,120
less than 256 values and a lot of result

1969
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:11,920
fields

1970
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,239
so this is just an example from

1971
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:15,440
wireshark

1972
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,480
so uh of a simple load

1973
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:21,520
the load size is uh 48 bytes

1974
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:26,400
and 24 of them exactly 50 are zeros

1975
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,040
next please

1976
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,800
so the other problem is that uh the load

1977
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:33,520
length

1978
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,159
occupies exactly two bytes so the load

1979
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:36,560
size

1980
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,920
is limited to 64 kilobytes and

1981
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,840
there's no problem with messages so it's

1982
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,920
now because uh

1983
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,800
in like he does there are four bytes

1984
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,280
four lengths it's up to four gigabytes

1985
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,679
but each individual load cannot exceed

1986
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,800
64 kilobytes

1987
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,640
so next please so

1988
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,920
what do we have with all this uh if we

1989
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:02,400
make

1990
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,600
a load smaller then it would uh decrease

1991
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,040
power network bandwidth

1992
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,159
for iot devices which is very precise

1993
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:10,719
for them

1994
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,920
receivers for them and it

1995
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,840
would also decrease chances of the

1996
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,560
fermentation in the initial exchange

1997
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,280
which is also very important uh because

1998
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:22,480
accreditation

1999
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:26,080
doesn't work in the initial exchange

2000
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,640
next please

2001
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,880
and if we uh lift 64 kilobytes size

2002
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,360
limit

2003
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,400
as that this would allow using quantum

2004
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,640
algorithm public keys that some people

2005
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,760
want to use

2006
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,760
it also would allow transfers large

2007
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,120
chunks of data

2008
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:46,640
for example in configuration below

2009
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:51,199
so uh the next piece

2010
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,199
uh what requirement can uh

2011
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:58,480
and information must differ much have

2012
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,520
so it must be suitable for us for small

2013
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,040
and large pollutants

2014
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,280
and it must be applicable for any below

2015
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,239
time including not yet defined and

2016
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,800
encoded person must remain simple enough

2017
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,440
to consume the resources

2018
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,440
uh at the same time sample loads might

2019
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,800
have special format

2020
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,760
if it is just a quiet it is very it if

2021
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,520
it is

2022
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,080
a lot of

2023
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,760
combat reducing in size can be achieved

2024
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,159
if you have special formats non-non not

2025
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,440
the generic one

2026
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:34,239
for the network

2027
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,679
so this is just it hope proposal i don't

2028
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:38,400
have draft

2029
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,840
it's just some thoughts to to coach an

2030
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,280
interest in the working group

2031
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:51,840
uh in this work so for example generic

2032
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,560
yep i think so

2033
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,760
okay i think he is still on participants

2034
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,520
i don't know if what happened to him

2035
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,159
oh no he's coming back oh no i was uh it

2036
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,400
was some strange i was

2037
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,120
kicked off from there

2038
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,480
they were talking they're noticing you

2039
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,480
were talking too much

2040
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,600
go ahead well okay uh

2041
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,239
so uh just repeat and this is a proposal

2042
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:26,639
etc

2043
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,480
proposal i don't have a draft it's just

2044
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,800
some sort so it is possible to have

2045
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,239
three possible format for

2046
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:35,199
uh generic reload heater for smoky loads

2047
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,400
uh with up to

2048
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:39,440
uh 64 bytes in length for medium size

2049
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,199
below it up to four kilobytes

2050
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,280
eight kilobytes sorry and flash below

2051
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,320
its up to

2052
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,600
uh 512 megabytes uh

2053
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:51,280
i think we may uh and should uh or even

2054
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:51,840
shoot

2055
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,440
and get rid of all reserved fields

2056
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,679
because we never use them

2057
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,560
uh we can revise existing load heater to

2058
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,760
reduce their size

2059
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,159
also remove unnecessary fields when they

2060
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,159
duplicate each other

2061
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,040
and uh we can define the special formats

2062
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,239
for some balloons

2063
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,480
for to my mind it comes in a safer load

2064
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,960
and empty status notifies it is very

2065
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,760
very often used and that's please

2066
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,840
this is just the top proposal for new

2067
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,040
generic

2068
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,639
heater so we can leave

2069
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,600
a critical beat and use the next two

2070
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,840
bits to indicate as the length of ballot

2071
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,440
uh of the field per load length so

2072
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,719
uh it's just in this uh

2073
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,199
format in the ballot key field uh block

2074
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:40,000
length field

2075
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,360
and have a length of either 6 bits

2076
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:47,600
13 bits or 29 bits for large blocks

2077
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,880
depending on the probability bits next

2078
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,120
please

2079
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,920
uh we can revise an existing load

2080
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,800
heaters

2081
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,639
for example for key exchange

2082
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,239
identification authentication

2083
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,520
configuration to load

2084
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,239
we can remove reserve fields for notify

2085
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,320
pollute we can remove spare size because

2086
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:06,639
it

2087
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:09,520
depends on protocol 18 it can be

2088
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,080
deducted

2089
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,800
from it for delete we can remove a spare

2090
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:13,280
size

2091
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,080
uh either and we can remove normal of

2092
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,280
spi fill because

2093
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,520
it can be deducted from the load length

2094
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,040
the traffic selected we can remove

2095
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,120
reserve field and remove number of ts

2096
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,199
because it can also be deducted from the

2097
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:26,480
load length

2098
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,560
the next piece so we can define a

2099
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,960
special format photo loads it's inspired

2100
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,600
by

2101
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,880
my draft that is rather old and

2102
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,719
i was presented it long ago so

2103
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,880
uh for a simple load we can define a

2104
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,960
special format that can reduce its size

2105
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,440
very significantly and we can also

2106
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,960
define the special format from the

2107
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,080
type of load with is it contains

2108
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,719
an empty uh no data so activity file

2109
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,120
provides its status type multiplication

2110
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,440
it can be also decreased in size very

2111
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,199
very significantly

2112
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:04,480
so let's please

2113
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,320
this is an example of a safer load

2114
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,600
format that can have a special format

2115
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,159
uh if the current disable load

2116
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:18,239
in this example has a lens of 48 bytes

2117
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:20,719
a special format only eleven lanes in

2118
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:21,440
points

2119
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,280
it's exactly the same semantics

2120
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:35,840
and next please

2121
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,840
next next piece

2122
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,719
and for 95 per load we can reduce it to

2123
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:43,440
2 bytes

2124
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,320
and 25 per load from 8 byte to 2 bytes

2125
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,199
with the first

2126
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:50,239
258 status notifications because this

2127
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:51,440
payload is used

2128
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,520
very often in like without immigration

2129
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:55,360
you can to negotiate different kind of

2130
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,159
things

2131
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,040
it will also significantly decrease the

2132
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:02,080
size of the message

2133
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,719
the next belief

2134
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,320
uh how this can be negotiated

2135
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,840
i think there are three options first

2136
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,880
we can define new major like version i

2137
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,080
don't think

2138
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,239
where it is good or bad but it will

2139
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,199
clear

2140
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:22,480
allow to negotiate a new uh promotes

2141
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,560
because uh the old responders will be

2142
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,800
returning by each major version

2143
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,840
we can define new type of initial

2144
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,480
exchange for example

2145
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,880
all type assignment and of course all

2146
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,400
the respondents will return the english

2147
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:35,520
syntax that will

2148
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,440
allow uh the initiator to either

2149
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,480
uh re-initiate with the old formats or

2150
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,520
either we can include we can define a

2151
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,520
new critical payload from india i can

2152
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,000
say

2153
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,480
followed by balloons a new format so

2154
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,040
since the loads are passed one by one

2155
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,440
and once a responder encounters a

2156
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,880
critical below that it doesn't

2157
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,719
understand it will return and support a

2158
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:01,840
critical reload

2159
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,120
and it doesn't mean it doesn't matter

2160
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,480
if it can't pass the rest of the message

2161
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,120
so there are three options at least so

2162
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:13,840
the next piece

2163
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,320
so discussion we don't need to assign

2164
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,440
new blood types

2165
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,679
except for special format to say we can

2166
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,600
reuse

2167
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,880
the existing uh load types

2168
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,760
if it is clearly in the context that the

2169
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,840
new format must apply for example if my

2170
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,159
question is changed

2171
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,719
or we can define a new below types if it

2172
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,159
will exactly

2173
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,480
uh for the for existing pillows it was

2174
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,960
just duplicated

2175
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,440
for latch below transport issues are out

2176
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,000
of scope

2177
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,639
of new format and it is assumed that

2178
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:49,920
tycho tcp

2179
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,440
will be used in combination with like

2180
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,600
fermentation because

2181
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,719
i go tcp has a limitation itself

2182
01:25:56,719 --> 01:25:58,560
on the size of message of each

2183
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,880
individual messages that is 64 televised

2184
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:01,280
so

2185
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,760
like fragmentation might be it in this

2186
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,080
case

2187
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,760
what about certificate certificates

2188
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,679
consumer letter space but they can be

2189
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:10,960
compressed there are at least two

2190
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,760
proposals

2191
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,280
i don't know of one of uh from taylor's

2192
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,480
world it's just use a generic purpose

2193
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:22,239
uh compression algorithm or there is

2194
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:23,840
more radical proposal

2195
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,719
in draft medicine because your search

2196
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:27,360
effect

2197
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,880
compressed vector defines x 509

2198
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,920
certificates in sibo

2199
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,760
uh the next please

2200
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,280
so comments uh this is just as i said i

2201
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,800
don't have drafting

2202
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:46,080
and i just want to to gouge uh

2203
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:48,320
if there is any interest in this work in

2204
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,760
the working group

2205
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,679
all right so any comments on i guess

2206
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,840
michael is the first in the queue

2207
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,480
so michael your comments hi michael

2208
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,440
richardson so

2209
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,719
um if you're doing this um

2210
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,840
for uh constrained devices then you

2211
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,840
should be implementing this in cbor

2212
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,400
zebra already has uh variable length

2213
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,120
integers

2214
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,600
including down to one byte including the

2215
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,639
code

2216
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:17,760
so um that would be much better uh way

2217
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,000
and

2218
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,719
we could walk through the two-spec and

2219
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,719
we could translate it to cdl

2220
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,159
express it as cbor and uh i would say

2221
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:26,560
that

2222
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,199
probably will get a much better uh

2223
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,320
compression

2224
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,880
there and a much higher code you use and

2225
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,400
if you're going to compress certificates

2226
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,080
with that document then you need to see

2227
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,280
board anyway

2228
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,199
um so there you go um if you were doing

2229
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,960
this so that you can have larger than

2230
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,480
64k

2231
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,920
uh content for then i think that is

2232
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,400
uh encoding as cbor is not a terrible

2233
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:51,120
thing

2234
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:54,880
um but it may not be the the most

2235
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:58,560
uh easy to do as you your slide on uh

2236
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,239
like v3 etc uh there at this point the

2237
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:02,880
iot

2238
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,840
space is not using ipsec at all um

2239
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,840
despite what some people think

2240
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,960
um and i would really need

2241
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,159
want to see some real um

2242
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,440
non-research applications of it um

2243
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,120
before i thought this working group

2244
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,719
should spend the time on it

2245
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:22,960
having said that i really think iot

2246
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,639
space should be using ipsec

2247
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:27,679
but it's not so i don't think it's worth

2248
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:30,320
pursuing at this point

2249
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,480
well uh thank you i was thinking about

2250
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,600
sibo

2251
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,760
uh as as one of uh is one of approaches

2252
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,440
but uh to be frank i'm not an expert in

2253
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,000
as far as as i understand it requires

2254
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,800
allocation

2255
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,639
of tax from some registry uh

2256
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:52,159
from possible control registry

2257
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:57,839
does it so

2258
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:03,440
you know not a chair but i think my

2259
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,320
comments on this is that i think

2260
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,159
i think there's two issues here and i

2261
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,760
think we should keep them separate one

2262
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,360
is that do we actually

2263
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:14,000
want to raise this payload size limit

2264
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,840
from 64 kilobytes to

2265
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,840
larger because that's completely that's

2266
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,040
not something that they are going to be

2267
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,960
used in iot environments

2268
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,040
in compressed formats if you are going

2269
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:24,080
to be having

2270
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:27,280
sending you know 64 kilobyte over 664

2271
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,239
kilobyte

2272
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:30,960
stuff you are not concerned about couple

2273
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,120
of bits in the you know header

2274
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,639
sure so so i think that should be a

2275
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:36,719
separate issue and uh

2276
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,880
i think we should probably leave it out

2277
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,960
in this discussion and add it because we

2278
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:41,760
are talking about

2279
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,520
more or less actually if you are working

2280
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,280
on the completely new payload format

2281
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,040
10 yes we want to think about that but

2282
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,480
if you think about compressing the

2283
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,360
current one

2284
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,600
like talk about seabor i don't think we

2285
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,880
actually need to talk about that and

2286
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,600
there

2287
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,440
uh i was thinking about more or less

2288
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,520
that what most of these things that you

2289
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,400
actually doing

2290
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,239
are this kind of static header

2291
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:01,920
compression stuff so we could actually

2292
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,480
one of the

2293
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,400
way of looking at this would be also to

2294
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,560
work on this kind of we have an eye

2295
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,560
version two packet that has you know

2296
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:11,760
stuff there then we compress it down

2297
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,920
to something that is you know we see

2298
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,000
that okay it's a payload notify

2299
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,080
there's a no click on critical bits and

2300
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,840
then there's a length here we just you

2301
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:20,239
know

2302
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,760
compress it down let's just see that

2303
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,080
okay short enough we put one bit in the

2304
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:24,960
received with

2305
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,040
one saying that okay this is compressed

2306
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,199
payload we have rest six bits as

2307
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:31,120
a length and then we have a compressed

2308
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,560
notify payload

2309
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,960
and when we when we we can actually

2310
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:35,679
create first

2311
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:37,920
normal notify payload and then compress

2312
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,120
it down this

2313
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,440
representation then authenticate and

2314
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,360
encrypt it send it to that and i don't

2315
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,199
expand it the good thing is that we can

2316
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:47,600
actually still use the original payloads

2317
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,080
if we happen to have suddenly have

2318
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,360
something that we can't

2319
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,280
compress because somebody actually used

2320
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,679
some of the research fields

2321
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:57,840
so and this would actually be the same

2322
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,199
kind of thing that converted into

2323
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:00,880
seaboard we could actually have you know

2324
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:04,000
ice version two payload uh encode that

2325
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:04,480
as a c

2326
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,679
board and set it out

2327
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:09,600
we only encode those things with

2328
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,880
keyboard that are actually you know

2329
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,520
usable in normal case and then

2330
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,920
special case it would be it wouldn't you

2331
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,239
know remove the old eye version

2332
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,800
2 code but i think still will need that

2333
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,400
most likely for backwards compatibly

2334
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,440
anyway

2335
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,639
but but i think this is something that

2336
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,320
would be interesting to work on

2337
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:33,120
and uh at least they yeah

2338
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,920
okay so there's a couple of comments in

2339
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,239
uh

2340
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:39,280
in in chat but yeah it's cool scott

2341
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,719
disagrees with you

2342
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:43,760
yeah i know and we are getting running

2343
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:44,960
out of time very soon

2344
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,639
so we probably okay let's see that uh

2345
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:51,760
squatting saying i disagree with terror

2346
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,920
if you are opening up the hood by

2347
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,199
tweaking payload for what

2348
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,679
it makes sense to address different

2349
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,360
requirements construct devices and

2350
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:03,280
64 kilobit payloads so yeah i just want

2351
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:04,480
to answer

2352
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,520
uh well uh what you described it

2353
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,960
this approach was used in uh direct uh

2354
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:13,520
of smith's equity compact it was just a

2355
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,360
generic encoder to code a prayer

2356
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,719
encoding post

2357
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,360
prayer decoding and post encoding that

2358
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,080
just converts

2359
01:32:22,159 --> 01:32:24,560
existing critical format into compact

2360
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:25,199
form

2361
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:28,400
and vice versa and uh it's

2362
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,080
it's a good approach but unfortunately

2363
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,880
it can be you can use if you want to

2364
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,080
uh lift 64 kilobytes limit

2365
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,320
because for this thing you must redefine

2366
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,679
because you don't

2367
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:43,440
have an existing balloon well anyway

2368
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,440
we have a draft uh beyond 64 kilobytes

2369
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:47,920
that

2370
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:51,600
just uh suggest another approach

2371
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,639
when a sequence of payloads

2372
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:57,760
uh with a size uh less

2373
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,120
or equal than 64 kilobytes is used as a

2374
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,239
single

2375
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,800
data unit for this type of payload and

2376
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,880
uh its size can be greater

2377
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,400
than 64 kilobytes in this case but uh

2378
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,480
it's a last itf you have suggested that

2379
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,159
probably instead of these

2380
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:18,320
approaches it is definitely a protocol

2381
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,199
hack

2382
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:22,560
some hack so we can redefine and upload

2383
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,120
vermont

2384
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:25,840
that's why this presentation appears so

2385
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:26,960
i'm trying to

2386
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,600
to go which whether it is interesting or

2387
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,360
we can return to this

2388
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,000
to that proposal because it is still

2389
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:34,560
valid

2390
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,120
to

2391
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:46,719
royal thing i would say that if you are

2392
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:48,159
defining i question

2393
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:51,199
3 i don't think that's a minor extension

2394
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:53,520
or or maintenance of five version two

2395
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,920
i think we probably would require at

2396
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,600
least the recharging perhaps even a

2397
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,600
university group for that

2398
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:02,639
if we are doing compression of existing

2399
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,199
payload stuff and things are under that

2400
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,280
then we can do it here if we are you

2401
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,280
know using reusing the existing hypers

2402
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,719
and two payloads to having multiple

2403
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,080
payloads in one message

2404
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,320
that's also belongs here so but i think

2405
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,320
we are running out of the time very soon

2406
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,040
so we

2407
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,040
actually need to go forward i think it

2408
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:20,320
would be interesting to get some

2409
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:23,920
discussion on the list about this

2410
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,800
all right so the next one is paul

2411
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:33,839
moving to the graveyard

2412
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,880
we are not hearing you unmute yourself

2413
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:44,159
now i can hear something i think

2414
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,559
strange

2415
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,599
okay so next slide

2416
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:55,920
so um this slide has been sort of a

2417
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,360
drifting in between

2418
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,159
uh what to do and fallen in

2419
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:01,520
administrative cracks

2420
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,080
um basically i've just bumped the

2421
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,320
document to prevent it from dying

2422
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,080
and i just wanted to reiterate that the

2423
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,440
only thing this document does

2424
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,679
is create and i think it's most

2425
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:12,800
important thing

2426
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,840
create ayana status columns for all the

2427
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:16,639
iana

2428
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,480
registries so that we can add things

2429
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:20,080
like deprecated there with the link to

2430
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:21,760
the rfc

2431
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,440
and then formally closes you know like

2432
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,040
v1 registries

2433
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,440
remind people like everyone's historic

2434
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,520
and tells implemented to stop using

2435
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,719
to stop implementing ikvan um i think

2436
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,480
even if we decide not to do this because

2437
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:35,920
people go like well we are not the

2438
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,360
internet police and

2439
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,080
if people use iqv1 then go ahead we

2440
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,280
still need a document to

2441
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,520
i think add the ayanna column for

2442
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,360
deprecated to some of these

2443
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,760
things so um if you're having that

2444
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,360
document you might as well nudge them a

2445
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,239
little bit

2446
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:53,360
further from from not using ip1

2447
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,920
so um i've now bumped this twice so i

2448
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:56,560
think you know

2449
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,280
um you should really uh move on um i

2450
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,560
don't think there's a next page is there

2451
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,040
there is oh yeah this is just a shaming

2452
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:05,840
tarot

2453
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,560
into the process um so so nothing has

2454
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,520
happened

2455
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,239
we should just either adopt this or kill

2456
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,119
it um

2457
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:14,560
but then if you kill it i'm going to

2458
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,639
come back with the status column for

2459
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,840
ayana draft document

2460
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,840
right um

2461
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,080
okay uh can you hear me

2462
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:37,760
yes okay okay great uh uh

2463
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,080
my name is dan harkins so i actually

2464
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,520
support adopting this

2465
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:43,440
uh but i think there we should do some

2466
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,960
changes uh

2467
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:46,880
so paul thanks for doing this first of

2468
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,560
all uh

2469
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,960
similar to what tls is doing deprecating

2470
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,719
tls 1.0 i think that

2471
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:55,119
this should be a bcp not uh standards

2472
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:56,400
track

2473
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,840
uh and also you know i

2474
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,080
it went from die die die to graveyard

2475
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,840
but you know i don't think we need these

2476
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,520
these cutesy names i think you know just

2477
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,840
make it like v1 to historic

2478
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,040
should be should be fine uh sec

2479
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,960
i think section three can be cleaned up

2480
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,080
there's a lot of

2481
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:15,679
subjective opinion in there like you

2482
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,600
know a high chance of this or

2483
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,800
quite often this or most likely that and

2484
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:23,119
you know i think all you need need to

2485
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:24,159
say is that

2486
01:37:24,159 --> 01:37:26,800
anything that ike v1 could do like v2

2487
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,080
can do better

2488
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,840
and the only reason that anybody wanted

2489
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:31,920
to do like v1 was labeled ipsec

2490
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,600
and and post quantum and both of those

2491
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,679
reasons go away with

2492
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:37,920
the the advancement of these these other

2493
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,679
drafts

2494
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:43,280
uh regarding uh uh deprecating all of

2495
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,880
these registries i think

2496
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,080
i'm not really sure whether that's

2497
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:48,239
necessary uh

2498
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:50,639
it if you know you know you note that

2499
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,159
there hasn't been any work on ikv one

2500
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,080
for over a decade

2501
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:57,119
uh and i'm not really and

2502
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:58,960
if this does go to historic i'm not

2503
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,880
really sure what sort of

2504
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:04,880
subterfuge could could happen uh by not

2505
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:07,360
you know without deprecating these these

2506
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,320
registries

2507
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,239
but the reason i'm i'm cautioning on

2508
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:11,360
this is because other

2509
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:14,320
other organizations are using uh at

2510
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:15,280
least one part of

2511
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,840
the ikv one registry and i think you

2512
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:18,800
know before we

2513
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,119
just go deprecate everything i think it

2514
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,159
should be we

2515
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:25,360
we really need a good reason why uh my

2516
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,159
final comment

2517
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:29,760
is uh you mentioned

2518
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,600
that one of one of the reasons not to

2519
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,679
use ike v1 is because it uses

2520
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,040
quote very weak groups two and five

2521
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,040
but then you don't go and deprecate them

2522
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,679
all you're deprecating is 1 and 22.

2523
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,360
so it's the reason why you don't want to

2524
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:44,960
deprecate

2525
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,320
these very weak groups as well so the

2526
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:49,760
the reason they're not deprecated here

2527
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,520
is that we have another cycle of

2528
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,840
documents for that so we've got like rc

2529
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,119
um a223 and

2530
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:59,199
four seven that are specifically about

2531
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:00,960
espn algorithms

2532
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,600
and and deprecating those so this

2533
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:04,560
document

2534
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,199
only talks about the things that uh are

2535
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:08,639
not talked about in those documents and

2536
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:09,760
there's a lot of

2537
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,760
may algorithms that people just never

2538
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,280
bothered to deprecate

2539
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,960
that this document sort of tried to pick

2540
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:18,400
up and just deprecate as well

2541
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,960
uh this terror given i'm talking now as

2542
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,199
an i am an expert for i person two

2543
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:26,480
registries

2544
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,800
and there was this discussion about

2545
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:30,480
adding this uh

2546
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:34,239
status column to the uh iron registry i

2547
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:34,480
i

2548
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,880
i'm not against having status clone that

2549
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:39,360
only has a deprecated and not

2550
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,719
its tattoos i i'm against if we actually

2551
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:43,760
want to have

2552
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,040
there have been people saying that we

2553
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:47,280
should have an should must and that

2554
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:49,119
should be that kind of information in

2555
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,800
the iron registry and i don't think

2556
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:52,639
we don't want to doubt that adding this

2557
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,239
status column that has deprecated

2558
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:57,360
is okay for me uh thai question one

2559
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:58,400
registries

2560
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,440
are already closed okay that

2561
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,040
you can't actually allocate anything

2562
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,440
that if you do i think the ayana should

2563
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,520
be complaining about that anyway

2564
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,080
uh the only thing that is actually i

2565
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,920
think they are

2566
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,239
we are just moving the actually i i

2567
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:15,520
think there is there is there

2568
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,119
they are we have already decided that

2569
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:18,880
they are closed in that way so i don't

2570
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:19,360
think that

2571
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,159
but that is but that's a very informal

2572
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:23,440
thing of the um

2573
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,560
ayana registry expert aka iu um

2574
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,800
no no no i i'm not i question one

2575
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,159
registers are ist

2576
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,719
they are they are standard document

2577
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:35,440
required

2578
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:37,360
to update them they are not expert

2579
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:38,960
review i questions oh

2580
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,440
okay okay so so but but i think that

2581
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,880
there is there is already you know

2582
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,040
decision not to add anything there and

2583
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,960
and moving demo closely closer doesn't

2584
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:47,840
change anything

2585
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:51,119
they still they stay there external

2586
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,159
documents can still refer to them it

2587
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:55,920
doesn't change anything from them point

2588
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,600
of view because they still can't be

2589
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,360
doing any updates with them and they

2590
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,040
haven't been able to do any updates with

2591
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,080
them anyway

2592
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:05,600
since the last time uh uh.11

2593
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:08,560
forced us to update things there even if

2594
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,159
would it have been needed

2595
01:41:10,159 --> 01:41:13,520
but anyway so yeah so i think

2596
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:18,080
uh that's my comments for this

2597
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:22,320
i think ben is next yeah so i had

2598
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:25,280
a few things that i wanted to reply to

2599
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:25,600
that

2600
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,320
dan had said uh so dan suggested that

2601
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,480
this could be a bcp document

2602
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,639
the way that the tls old version this

2603
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,560
deprecate was

2604
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:35,679
but that was actually pretty

2605
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:38,320
controversial to do that as bcp

2606
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,159
and there were a couple folks during the

2607
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:41,920
itf last call

2608
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,840
that suggested it would have been better

2609
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,159
as a rc2026 applicability statement

2610
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:50,880
and that it was okay to do the tls thing

2611
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,800
as a bcp just this one time but in the

2612
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,480
future we should be mindful and do it

2613
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:55,440
differently

2614
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,679
so it's not really clear to me that we

2615
01:41:57,679 --> 01:41:59,199
want to

2616
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:01,840
switch to doing this as a bcp versus a

2617
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,600
different way

2618
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,840
dan had also mentioned that we could

2619
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,719
move the old documents to historic if i

2620
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:12,080
understood correctly

2621
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,719
there's something about historic and we

2622
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:15,440
do have a

2623
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,360
dedicated mechanism for changing the

2624
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:19,440
status of documents including moving the

2625
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,840
to historic which does not necessarily

2626
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,520
involve an rfc to do that there's a

2627
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:24,560
separate class of

2628
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,840
status change document and there's a isg

2629
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,480
statement

2630
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:30,800
about it that i will put in the chat

2631
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,719
after i stop talking

2632
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,480
yeah that's why the language was

2633
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,480
actually updated i think two versions

2634
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,600
ago to basically just

2635
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,280
remind them that it's historic and then

2636
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,199
basically you know we would

2637
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:42,639
start the process of making them

2638
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:43,920
historic because you're right that's

2639
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,840
yeah

2640
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,800
yeah exactly uh and then the other point

2641
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,920
dan made was about

2642
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,880
the version one registries that are in

2643
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:55,600
use by other organizations

2644
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,800
and i have in my local notes

2645
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,440
that the ieee is using them and i have a

2646
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,320
to do item

2647
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:06,159
to send a or to have us send a liaison

2648
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:07,600
statement to ieee

2649
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,199
before we actually make any new actions

2650
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:12,880
in terms of closing off

2651
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,920
or deprecating those registries just to

2652
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,320
make sure that everyone is aware and has

2653
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,719
a plan

2654
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:24,880
okay so i think the wi-fi alliance

2655
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,719
is also using it and our rfc 5931 uses

2656
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,239
it

2657
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:33,360
thanks i will add that to my notes all

2658
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,000
right so

2659
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,119
so i think but i think we are still

2660
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:40,560
i think the uh adopting this uh document

2661
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:41,679
is still

2662
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,960
uh okay so i think we should adopt this

2663
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:47,119
document as a working group item

2664
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,520
and then start working on it or actually

2665
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,960
finish working on it i don't think

2666
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,199
that's actually requires that much work

2667
01:43:53,199 --> 01:43:55,920
but except yeah dan has some comments so

2668
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,360
if you actually adopt it as a working

2669
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,880
group program and then we can work on it

2670
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,119
and

2671
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,360
and i would actually like to publish it

2672
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:02,719
out and if anybody has any

2673
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:05,280
comments or disagreements or adopting

2674
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,280
this uh or making starting the adaption

2675
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,400
call

2676
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,600
uh please say now something

2677
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:14,560
or sent to the list but i will start an

2678
01:44:14,560 --> 01:44:15,440
adopting

2679
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:20,239
call for this after this idf

2680
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:22,000
okay so let's move to the forward the

2681
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,280
next one is pgp

2682
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:27,280
update for sd1 edge discovery

2683
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:29,360
linda or whoever is going to be

2684
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:30,800
presenting that

2685
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,480
yes can you hear me yes i can hear you

2686
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,840
good good okay so um

2687
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:41,040
we have this draft in idr um

2688
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:44,400
for the sd1 h discovery

2689
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:48,000
um what it is is sd1 is basically

2690
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,119
adding additional bandwidth to

2691
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:54,320
the existing mpls vpn network so the

2692
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,040
provisioning

2693
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,639
is slightly different from the ipsec

2694
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:01,040
so the reason for us to come to here to

2695
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:01,760
ipsec

2696
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,320
me group is to get the feedback on what

2697
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,840
we did what we are doing

2698
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,320
and see if there's any problem with that

2699
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:09,840
and because our next step

2700
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,960
is for working group last call

2701
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,119
okay next page please

2702
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:20,800
okay so um here just some typical

2703
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,600
comparison with the traditional ipsec

2704
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,880
configuration

2705
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,560
so for the pgp controlled sd1 so we have

2706
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:29,600
the mpos

2707
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,040
vpn already existing and we're adding

2708
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,199
additional episode tunnels between the

2709
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:35,679
two

2710
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:39,119
edge nodes to increase the bandwidth

2711
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:42,000
the differences be to the traditional

2712
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:42,880
ipsec

2713
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:47,440
is those cpes are already connected to

2714
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,600
the controller which is the route

2715
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,719
reflect rr

2716
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,920
in this diagram through a secure channel

2717
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,360
so the authentication is already down

2718
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,119
because they have to control other

2719
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:02,480
configuration for the cpe2 and cpu one

2720
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,920
um so and also for the

2721
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,920
um um the like we called um the

2722
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,360
ipsec we call traffic selector you

2723
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,800
we have in bgp we have route target

2724
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,159
with broad target you can import a

2725
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:21,760
particular vif

2726
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,119
or export vif and so that your

2727
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:27,840
your routes can be allowed to talk or

2728
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:29,760
not allowed to talk

2729
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,440
and all those policies are implemented

2730
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:37,440
through the client vrf and

2731
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:39,440
so with this you can scale better with

2732
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:40,880
large number of nodes

2733
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,679
so so this is just the compare with the

2734
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,280
traditional episode

2735
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:48,320
next page please

2736
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,880
so here we put a table here i want to

2737
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,080
get your feedback

2738
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,719
the highlight yellow means the bgp

2739
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,000
controlled sd1

2740
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,800
for the ipsec parameter exchange can be

2741
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:00,719
optimized in the bgp control

2742
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:03,119
hdmi environment and the gray part is

2743
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:04,480
the same as

2744
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,280
ipsec traditional configuration

2745
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,719
especially for the

2746
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:11,360
um the authenticated peers the

2747
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:12,080
controller

2748
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,320
actually has the total saying a total

2749
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,520
control on

2750
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,920
which node can this particular node can

2751
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,520
communicate with

2752
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,239
and the communication is already

2753
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:23,600
authenticated

2754
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:26,239
and for the remote peer address

2755
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,440
configuration

2756
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:29,679
that is also controlled by the route

2757
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:30,639
reflector

2758
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:33,119
the policy is in the controller and not

2759
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:34,880
on the node themselves

2760
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:38,400
um the the grey part the ip

2761
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:42,159
i ik v2 proposal the transform set

2762
01:47:42,159 --> 01:47:45,440
those are the same even with bgp we have

2763
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:45,840
to

2764
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:49,440
exchange them through the messaging

2765
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,800
for the client discovery the prefix

2766
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,800
discovery like when you have multiple

2767
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,159
client prefix

2768
01:47:56,159 --> 01:47:58,719
attached to the edge node um in the

2769
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:00,000
ipsec you run

2770
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,199
routing protocol in each of the tunnels

2771
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,639
in bgp update bg update itself

2772
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:10,159
will update advertise the client

2773
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:12,880
attached to the particular node and also

2774
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,560
associate tunnels

2775
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:17,760
so here the last one is the access list

2776
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,560
or traffic control traffic selector and

2777
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,920
is

2778
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,040
achieved by the bgp route target

2779
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,239
import and export raw target next page

2780
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:30,480
please

2781
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,199
okay so so here's uh just explanation on

2782
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:33,920
how does

2783
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,040
um client traffic are exchanged

2784
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:40,880
so in bgp we have those recursive update

2785
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:43,520
we advertise the the bgp advertise the

2786
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:46,320
client route like for example 10.1

2787
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:50,159
slash 1624 and

2788
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,880
um the next hop is the node which is

2789
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,239
cpe2

2790
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:57,679
and then it can have the

2791
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,040
extended community to indicate this is a

2792
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:01,760
hybrid

2793
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:05,360
tunnel which includes mpos tunnel and

2794
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:08,639
the ipsec tunnel and we use color to

2795
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:12,560
coordinate with the update 2.

2796
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:16,639
so update 2 is more about infrastructure

2797
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:20,080
information so

2798
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,199
that this will

2799
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:26,960
describe in detail of the like episode

2800
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,480
parameters

2801
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:32,159
or the vpn mpos parameters

2802
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:35,520
um and also indicate for specific

2803
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,480
um ipsec um like inner encapsulation

2804
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,679
whether gi or other other

2805
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,599
form of inner encapsulation so with this

2806
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:50,960
the client update is separated from the

2807
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:51,599
ipsec

2808
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:54,400
itself make it more flexible and make it

2809
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:56,719
scale better

2810
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:01,280
next page please so

2811
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:04,800
so for the bgp update you can include

2812
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,400
the ipsec attributes

2813
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:11,199
or you can be have a pre-established

2814
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,880
security association

2815
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,560
with the identifier so for the underlay

2816
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:19,599
tunnel advertisement we can include

2817
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:22,840
the ipsec sa

2818
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,239
identifier and together with the inner

2819
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:31,360
encapsulation um next page please

2820
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:34,800
and you can also give this specific

2821
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:38,800
episode subtlyovs which indicate all the

2822
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,480
key information the nouns the transform

2823
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:43,920
set

2824
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:48,159
next page so

2825
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:51,119
i sent the email to the episode me a few

2826
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:52,080
weeks ago

2827
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,560
asking for feedback i got some people

2828
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:55,440
coming back with

2829
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,920
questions so i just want to take this

2830
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,599
opportunity to

2831
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:02,000
get feedback see if there's any major

2832
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,280
flaw we're doing

2833
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:06,480
in bgp and if not that would be great

2834
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:07,280
then we will

2835
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:12,320
go for working group adoption in idea

2836
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:15,119
any questions

2837
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:19,119
all right so i don't see any questions

2838
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:20,159
here

2839
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:23,280
running out of time so the two

2840
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,080
resources are only a couple of minutes

2841
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:26,719
each

2842
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:31,440
so try to be very fast okay

2843
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:35,920
next one go ahead

2844
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,760
yeah um hi everybody can you hear me

2845
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:43,199
okay great um yeah this is leonie

2846
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,040
brockett from zakunet

2847
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,920
um i'd like to raise the topic of

2848
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:49,280
alternative signatures

2849
01:51:49,280 --> 01:51:53,759
in ikv2 next slide please

2850
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:58,480
so the iso x509 standard defines

2851
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:01,760
three extensions subject alt public key

2852
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:02,320
info

2853
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,800
alt signature algorithm and alt

2854
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:07,040
signature value

2855
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:10,320
they allow for for introduction

2856
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,719
of an alternative algorithm into

2857
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:14,400
certificates

2858
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,320
and they if if this extension is present

2859
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:21,360
and the application are upgraded the

2860
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,639
alternative algorithm is uh is used

2861
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:28,159
instead of the native fields

2862
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:31,119
so if you think of post-quantum

2863
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:32,320
cryptography

2864
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,080
so um you choose a post-quantum

2865
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,000
signature scheme as an alternative

2866
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,280
algorithm

2867
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:39,270
then this would mean that um

2868
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:40,639
[Music]

2869
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:43,520
only the post-quantum signature will be

2870
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,840
verified

2871
01:52:47,679 --> 01:52:50,960
so pc is not

2872
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:53,040
not fully trusted at the moment

2873
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,159
standardization

2874
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:57,520
will take some time so it may be it

2875
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:02,639
may be a good idea to use a hybrid mode

2876
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,760
so yeah of course this alternative

2877
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:06,880
extension

2878
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:10,239
allows for a smooth migration

2879
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,800
from one algorithm to another and is not

2880
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:13,760
limited to

2881
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:17,119
post-quantum cryptography but um

2882
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:18,480
yeah in case you want to use

2883
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:20,159
post-quantum cryptography early

2884
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:23,520
it may be a good idea to use yeah

2885
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:26,639
a hybrid solution such as it's done with

2886
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:29,599
the hybrid key exchange

2887
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,840
yeah so um the first question to the

2888
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,000
working group is

2889
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,440
has anyone already thought about

2890
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:41,119
how this alternative signature

2891
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:44,960
extension can be integrated in ike

2892
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,320
and the second question is um

2893
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,719
yeah i know some people that would

2894
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:53,119
prefer a hybrid solution

2895
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:55,599
so i'd like to hear your feedback do you

2896
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:57,679
think that we need a hybrid

2897
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:01,440
solution for signatures

2898
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:04,719
all right so i think we are now

2899
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,320
so much out of time that i don't think

2900
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,239
we actually want to cut the comments on

2901
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:08,639
here

2902
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:10,880
i think we want to discuss this in lamps

2903
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,880
or or some other working group because i

2904
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:13,440
don't think it's

2905
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:15,440
actually it's related to we actually

2906
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,119
just use the certificate as

2907
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,679
x5.9 gives them us to us or pickix or

2908
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,080
whatever

2909
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,960
jumping in as the area director there's

2910
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,560
been some discussion already

2911
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,480
in the lamps working group about post

2912
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:29,760
quantum crypto

2913
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,040
and the potential for doing hybrid and

2914
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:35,679
what the hybrid would actually look like

2915
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:37,440
so i think that may be

2916
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,000
best to try and consolidate the itf

2917
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,560
discussions of that in lamps

2918
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,960
and that would also give the opportunity

2919
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,639
to sort of align

2920
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:50,560
what we do for x 509 and pkix

2921
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,960
in general in the itf because i think as

2922
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:54,080
you note there is some stuff

2923
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,199
in the iso x509 that's

2924
01:54:57,199 --> 01:55:00,320
not really in the rfc 5280 that we

2925
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,960
tend to use in the itf so that would be

2926
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,480
my suggestion is to

2927
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,760
to talk about in lamps all right so

2928
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,400
there is a couple of comments in the uh

2929
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,719
jabber about this but uh i think we'll

2930
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:14,320
skip them now and go to the next

2931
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,400
presentation this is paul look at the

2932
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:18,320
five minutes for your two five-minute

2933
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,639
sessions so try to compress them in

2934
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:23,440
two and a half minutes each okay test

2935
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:24,800
okay

2936
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,719
so there was a draft a couple years ago

2937
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:28,800
about simplifying the re-key

2938
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,040
process by leaving out all the things

2939
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,880
that we don't need

2940
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,960
because they are staying the same anyway

2941
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:37,599
so this draft originally didn't see much

2942
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,760
adoption because there was some ipr

2943
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:40,800
confusion

2944
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,880
that has been resolved now so there's no

2945
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,639
no problems with ipr

2946
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:47,119
and i think it's a good good um drive to

2947
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:47,679
have

2948
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:50,400
um it will also um valerie will be happy

2949
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,199
to know

2950
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:53,040
greatly reduce the number of bytes and

2951
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,119
during reiki because you're basically

2952
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:57,840
skipping the entire sa payload all the

2953
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,400
algorithm negotiation parts they're all

2954
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:01,840
you don't send them you just

2955
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:04,719
send a new notify saying yeah same as

2956
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:05,679
before

2957
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:08,800
here's the new spy here's the old spy

2958
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:12,639
continue so next page

2959
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:15,599
um so the way they do it is they they

2960
01:56:15,599 --> 01:56:17,440
send a new notify a minimal reiki

2961
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:19,119
support it and then during the re-key

2962
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:20,639
you can omit the sa

2963
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:23,679
and or ts payloads and then send a

2964
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:26,719
unchanged message with the spy

2965
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:28,159
and everything else is the same as

2966
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:30,000
before and then

2967
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,800
next slide

2968
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,639
and uh the changes i think that are

2969
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:37,440
still needed for this document um

2970
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:40,080
it says that you're you could change

2971
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:41,360
your algorithms which

2972
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,800
i don't think is allowed so i don't i

2973
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,480
don't think we should have that text

2974
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,000
and there's some text that said what to

2975
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,239
deal with if your acls change to sort of

2976
01:56:48,239 --> 01:56:50,400
fall back to the old system but i think

2977
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:51,920
that should be simplified by well if

2978
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,199
your configuration changed and you

2979
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:54,480
reloaded from disk

2980
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:56,159
you should just delete all your items

2981
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:57,599
all your essays and start from scratch

2982
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,159
like we normally do

2983
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:03,760
and i think for the the sats unchanged

2984
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,760
payloads is where you basically

2985
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,360
[Music]

2986
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:10,080
do a child re-key i think we also need

2987
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,840
to send the old spy which is currently

2988
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:14,400
doesn't do because if we have multiple

2989
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:16,159
traffic selectors multiple child assays

2990
01:57:16,159 --> 01:57:17,679
with the exact same traffic selectors we

2991
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:19,119
really want to tell them which one we

2992
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:20,480
are replacing with this wiki and

2993
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,440
otherwise

2994
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,360
we don't know because normally that spy

2995
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,360
is present in the sa payload but we're

2996
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,199
not sending that now

2997
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:29,040
and i think we should clarify a bit more

2998
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,199
the bfs and the ke payload

2999
01:57:31,199 --> 01:57:33,520
so that's initial overview nichelle uh

3000
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:35,360
please read the draft

3001
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,920
um think about the idea and discuss this

3002
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:40,320
on the list

3003
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:49,440
and then the very last quick overview

3004
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,960
we've done some more work on the

3005
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,520
multiple sa performance issue draft

3006
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:57,760
so we have new code so we've updated

3007
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,280
code so please pull it down if you want

3008
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,040
to look at it

3009
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:02,719
so again it's for installing multiple

3010
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:05,360
ipsec assays one per cpu or one per

3011
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:06,960
quality of service

3012
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,840
um there's two notify payloads for that

3013
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:12,159
the q info one and the num q1 one tells

3014
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:13,360
you how many you want and the other

3015
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:13,920
tells you

3016
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,760
a bit information about each one of them

3017
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,679
so you can distinguish them

3018
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:21,360
next slide

3019
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,960
so this is the performance increase we

3020
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,800
see like it basically literally scales

3021
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,719
with the cpu is just a reminder

3022
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:29,679
so next slide

3023
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:33,520
so the changes we made the numcus now

3024
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:34,719
only has one value

3025
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:36,719
we found that negotiating minimum

3026
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:38,800
maximum leads to too many corner cases

3027
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,199
where um where things get confusing

3028
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:43,599
so we just take one number of the the

3029
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:46,159
preferred number and people can take the

3030
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:48,320
the largest of the two if it's not

3031
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,480
insane and outside of their you know

3032
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:53,920
ddos protection things um we also added

3033
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:54,320
uh

3034
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,320
a significant possibility for the cpu

3035
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,560
identifier initially we didn't have them

3036
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,159
but our experience has shown that

3037
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:03,760
if you start re-keying things it's

3038
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,400
really useful to know which one

3039
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:08,880
goes where or what what where it relates

3040
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:10,880
to so that you can better match the

3041
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,360
match then um and we did a bunch of

3042
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,599
readability improvements uh

3043
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:18,000
some language changing so again we would

3044
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:18,880
like people to

3045
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,599
read it and give us feedback and run our

3046
01:59:21,599 --> 01:59:22,000
code

3047
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,400
and then maybe we will all get consensus

3048
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:31,760
and that's it

3049
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:35,760
oh okay i i that's basically it like

3050
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,360
that actually one thing if you go one

3051
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:38,719
slide back sorry there's one important

3052
01:59:38,719 --> 01:59:40,480
thing i want to mention

3053
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:44,480
um the problem is that the rss on

3054
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,920
network cards for esp is rarely

3055
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,520
supported and so we're kind of stuck

3056
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,199
with if we want to do this properly we

3057
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:50,400
would really need to use

3058
01:59:50,400 --> 01:59:53,040
um encapsulation like udp encapsulation

3059
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:53,840
usually

3060
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,760
um the problem is if we have multiple

3061
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,199
one of them currently

3062
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:59,040
the protocol maps this all to a single

3063
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,119
port and we really would like some way

3064
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:02,800
where we can map them onto different

3065
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,960
ports so that they can actually use the

3066
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:05,599
rsr

3067
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:07,760
rss mechanism of the nic cards and it's

3068
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:10,320
currently not possible on ike

3069
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,880
and so we would really uh like some more

3070
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:16,400
people thinking about this problem

3071
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,639
all right so so i i will request

3072
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,480
that next time you put the draft name

3073
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,480
and put it in so that there's an ipsec

3074
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,239
ma in the name so it actually

3075
02:00:26,239 --> 02:00:28,719
shows up in the automatic uh listing of

3076
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:29,440
the

3077
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:32,560
draft but now it has this uh

3078
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:36,239
b voters that multi essay performance

3079
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:38,639
doesn't show up in the list so but yes

3080
02:00:38,639 --> 02:00:40,080
people would i would hope

3081
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,520
hope people would actually review this

3082
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:43,599
document and you can probably send a

3083
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:45,119
name reminder to the list and ask for

3084
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:46,560
reviews and so on

3085
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,560
but i think that's actually we are

3086
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,159
running out of time now

3087
02:00:50,159 --> 02:00:53,360
this was the final thing and i

3088
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,400
don't think we have a time for open

3089
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,400
discussion anymore because we used most

3090
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:58,800
of that

3091
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,119
during the earlier times so

3092
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:05,599
and we know we don't allow any puppies

3093
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:07,599
so

3094
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:11,199
i think that's it uh unless somebody has

3095
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:11,599
some

3096
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:13,760
really really important things before we

3097
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:16,400
close up

3098
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,760
okay i i don't hear anything so i hope

3099
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:22,480
we are going to be seeing people uh

3100
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:24,080
interacting in the list and try to get

3101
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:27,599
you know things going forward

3102
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,920
in my to-do like list i have an starting

3103
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,520
working group last call for

3104
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:36,719
lab labeled ap i question two do some

3105
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,800
reviews on eye question two

3106
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,719
make a working group other ups and call

3107
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:42,800
for uh meep document and grade your

3108
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:44,639
document and i think that's what

3109
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:46,960
i was i'm planning to do after this

3110
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,840
meeting closes

3111
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:57,280
so valerie you have still something

3112
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,199
uh i just want to remind that uh

3113
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:01,040
multiple key is

3114
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:05,840
oh multiple key access yes

3115
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:10,400
all right good thank you okay so we will

3116
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:10,719
see

3117
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:14,320
in next ietf or in gather town

3118
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:17,040
or somewhere else

3119
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:19,920
in sag everybody's gonna come to sag

3120
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:23,199
