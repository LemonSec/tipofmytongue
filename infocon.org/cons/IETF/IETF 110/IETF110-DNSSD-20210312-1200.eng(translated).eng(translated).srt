4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
coffee really fast then

5
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
that's the danger of the meetings that

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,840
start god awful early

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,039
okay let's see

8
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,720
so welcome to the combined dns sd

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,880
and home net your friendly chairs are

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,159
in just a wee bit of disarray because

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,520
we forgot to put together chair slides

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,798
um let me see

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,720
but we're going to work through this you

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
should be able to find

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,320
easily by google the ietf note well

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,840
which is enough to be displayed no need

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
to be a slide

18
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,320
and the agenda tracker so take it simply

19
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640
going to upload my home net slides and

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
just display the note weld that i pasted

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,560
on that

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,520

23
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,320
i'll have that

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,880

27
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,679
really annoying

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
okay

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,479
and then i have to switch it to the

30
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,639
other computer because i did it on one

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,799
and

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840

kodia md link

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
from the data tracker and if anyone else

51
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,599

52
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,239
or take notes while stewart is talking

53
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
please go and lend him a hand that would

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
be helpful

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,640
okay and that is the

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,200
really small agenda wow thank you um

57
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,799
and so we're going to be starting with

58
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,560
dns sd

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,080
and just a quick status we do

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,159
within the nssd have some drafts

61
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,799
that ted did update

62
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,920
um let's see

63
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,959
and we're going to be starting with ted

64
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
and so i need to pull down ted's slides

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,478
so that i can present them

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,120
all right should i do the uh the intro

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
or i guess that was our intro probably

68
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
uh we've lost your audio barbara oh yeah

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
i keep muting myself locally

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,000
it's easier than trying to find the

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
scroll to mouse over to the mute button

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
um

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,880
so jabber you know

74
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,040
we should all be able to monitor jabber

75
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,000
at this point because

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
it's so nicely integrated and uh

77
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,759
probably will be probably i could ever

78
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,800
scrap

79
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
i'm already in there and i'll keep an

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
eye on it and uh as usual folk

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,479
if you wanna or i'll type it in the

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,880
and stuart will you be taking notes on

83
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,280
code

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,880
md or elsewhere

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
that's actually what i'm just looking at

86
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,280
it appears that code md is the tool of

87
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,199
choice now is that right

88
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
yes yes right if you could use

89
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,240
that that would be wonderful

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,240
um uh yes i've not used this before

91
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,039
it tells me visit slash features if you

92
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,960
don't know what to do happy hacking it

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,800
seems like a bit of a text adventure

94
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
game

95
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
there's an edit button at the top right

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
somewhere

97
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,960
okay i'll figure it out okay

98
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,639
so let me see

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,319
meeting materials how does this work

100
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,039
oh you know i really should have done

101
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,080
the training

102
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,840
um let's see so i need to

103
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,520
right i guess i was going to say that we

104
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,280
haven't met in a while and this is how

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:35,840
it shows

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
i'm almost

107
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
there now is there any way i can

108
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
hmm i'm sharing through the browser i

109
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
hope it's just large enough

110
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,880
now that works but there's probably a

111
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,560
full screen button at some

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,240
somewhere well it's not a chromebook so

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,039
[Laughter]

114
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,800
all right well while you figure that out

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,240
maybe ted should get started

116
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
ah there we go

117
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,960
okay you're up ted

118
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
we can't hear you well uh

119
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,160
yeah you're you're very um

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
are you microphone well yeah actually

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,520
it's just very dim yeah or soft is the

122
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,240
right word i guess

123
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,840
no that's worse

124
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,560
we you're you're very very soft

125
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
by the way do we have an audio speaker

126
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
uh yes stewart's taking notes okay thank

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
you stuart

128
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
and uh ted if you go into the audio midi

129
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,599
setup app maybe you're

130
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,599
on the uh wrong microphone or maybe just

131
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,599
in the mid echo settings

132
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,479
in the top right and you know i found

133
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,599
the weirdest thing

134
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
in that even though i had selected my

135
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,199
audio on meet echo

136
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,840
that i actually had to go in my laptop

137
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
and select the right audio

138
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,080
output that it refused to acknowledge my

139
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,840
meat echo choice

140
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:41,838
still still we can't hear you ted

141
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,880
okay can you hear me now yes

142
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
um maybe just if you could have a little

143
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
more volume on your

144
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
mic or phone but if not that's okay

145
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,680
let me see if i can do that uh

146
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
it'll do

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,040
okay is this any better

148
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,600
did that prove anything okay i can like

149
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,279
how about now

150
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,480
i don't want to go too high or i'm going

151
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
to start clipping now you're fine

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
i can hear you you're very intelligible

153
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
at this point

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
that's good uh let's hope that i'm

155
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,399
actually intelligible when i start

156
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,440
talking

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,959
so um i actually have been doing a whole

158
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,600
bunch of

159
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
uh work that is a combination of home

160
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,200
net and

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,680
uh dns sd related work or at least so i

162
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,560
claim

163
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,279
um and

164
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,680
so uh can you guys still hear me

165
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,640

166
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
we hear you

167
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
i just uh sorry we decreased our videos

168
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
so i've been working on on this sort of

169
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,640
project that's that's involved a bunch

170
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,680
of

171
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,240
stuff having to do with with uh home net

172
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,959
and

173
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,079
uh dnssd and so this presentation is

174
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,600
actually a combined presentation with

175
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,120
all of the stuff that's on the agenda

176
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
for both working groups

177
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,240
in the same presentation because they're

178
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,839
deeply interrelated

179
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,440
um i'm there's a question in the air as

180
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,399
to whether

181
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,920
some of this work is home network or

182
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,600
whether it's not uh

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,160
partly because homenet has been fairly

184
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
inactive for a long time and so it's not

185
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,800
clear that there's

186
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,079
uh that there are people in the home

187
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,360
networking group that would like to work

188
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
on this so that's something we need to

189
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,399
explore but

190
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,000
it's certainly topical for home that and

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
it comes out of the work that i did

192
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,120
in homenet several years ago so let's go

193
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,480
to the next slide

194
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,880
oh it's not progressing let me see

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,120
um just a second let me i may have to

196
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,040
now i'm not hearing barbara this is

197
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,839
really bad

198
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,440
oh really i can hear barbara

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,240
yeah um and it's just that i'm pushing

200
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
buttons for my slides to progress but

201
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,959
they're not

202
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
oh okay there we go barbara i'm seeing

203
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
you talking and i see the little thing

204
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,680
making noises but no oh there david

205
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
spoke and i didn't hear that either this

206
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,079
is really really bad

207
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
but we oh well he's not going to hear me

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
let me type in the chat

209
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,160
tell him we hear you ted we hear you and

210
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
we love you you make

211
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760


212
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:57,839
let me see what happens

213
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
so barbara i have a slight

214
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,519
problem though on the ietf webpage

215
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,639
it starts with a dns sd

216
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
first and here we are into the omni part

217
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
some other people will join just for

218
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,839
home net and this part

219
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,760
stop networking which is scheduled in

220
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,360
one hour

221
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,639
so so i was really sorry that

222
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,399
if you wake up too early but you were

223
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,160
scheduled at 13 utc

224
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,120
in one hour for this part so i would

225
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,959
really and strongly suggest

226
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,760
that you start this part in one hour

227
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,399
other people

228
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,760
are interested in this part right so

229
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,880
that's your fame basically

230
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,839
we don't hear you baba

231
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,519
okay now it's sending audio really

232
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,480
okay um so yeah i was about to discuss

233
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,360
that with head

234
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,839
because uh we just got the slides

235
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,160
um well rather late for me from ted

236
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,880
i think is offering to present which

237
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,320
might make it easier

238
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
uh how about we let him what do you

239
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,319
think barbara

240
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,839
so ted are you wanting to do the

241
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,639
presenting

242
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,680
um can you guys hear me now yes we've

243
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,279
been hearing you the whole time it was

244
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,639
for just some reason you couldn't hear

245
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,600
us

246
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,079
i don't know what's going on like um i'm

247
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,360
just having the worst trouble here

248
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,880
i'm hearing you through my computer

249
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,320
speakers not through my headphone

250
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,399
speakers for some reason

251
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,360
so ted did you want to present or do you

252
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,920
want

253
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
me to you you click the uh present

254
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,440
button

255
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,399
oh did i okay so i'll just keep

256
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,360
presenting

257
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
now eric was bringing up a question in

258
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,720
that the way we put the agenda together

259
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,199
was dnssd topics first and there's

260
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,839
probably some people joining for dns sd

261
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,399
topics first and we put stub networks as

262
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
the start of the second hour

263
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
okay and i noticed that your um dns sd

264
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,160
update slides were kind of embedded in

265
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
the middle of this presentation

266
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,240
yeah i mean we could just go over those

267
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
and then wait until the

268
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,560
start time for the next bit okay i think

269
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,399
we suggest this because i got at least

270
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,519
two other people

271
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,399
asking me please ping me when the dns

272
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:36,800
the

273
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,760
home net and the networking starts that

274
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,399
looks like it's

275
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,079
important to pick for many people that

276
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,880
so okay

277
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
all right well so uh

278
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
yeah i think if we start here that gives

279
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,560
us the dnssd stuff

280
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,839
sorry i should have looked at the agenda

281
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,279
when i was preparing the slides but i

282
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,399
was like

283
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,440
i've just been completely maxed

284
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
um so can you go back one slide

285
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
oh okay okay

286
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,160
so um i was basically trying to weave

287
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,360
these two subjects together because

288
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
they're so tightly interrelated but but

289
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,920
since we're

290
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,440
since we have this split agenda let me

291
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
just talk about um the things on here

292
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
that are dnssd

293
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,480
which is the first four items so um

294
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,440
what i've been working on um has been so

295
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,760
so srp is actually very mature at this

296
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,240
point

297
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
um and uh is able to be used by

298
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,240
uh so the use case that we have right

299
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
now is um

300
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,440
uh iot devices registering for

301
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,480
to be able to be discovered um

302
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,519
and uh that's that's been working we had

303
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,279
an independent implementation that was

304
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,160
done

305
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
uh recently uh and so that's that's

306
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,480
really

307
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,800
uh quite a long ways along and i think

308
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,160
it's actually pretty close to ready for

309
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,519
a working group last call and i'll hit

310
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,800
that on another slide

311
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
i'm just going to give you the overview

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,360
here now so the service registration

313
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,040
protocol is about getting information

314
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
into the dns database that's pretty much

315
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,120
done at this point the work that's been

316
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,079
going on

317
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,480
that went on last year was the

318
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,320
advertising proxy getting an advertising

319
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
proxy which can advertise what's in that

320
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,040
database

321
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,160
on a link so the idea is

322
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,199
um you have uh you know normally we do

323
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,320
dnssd with

324
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
multicast dns because it's really easy

325
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,680
it's permissionless

326
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,320
uh etc but that doesn't work when you're

327
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,920
going across subnet boundaries and that

328
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
was one of the issues we ran into

329
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,399
when we tried to deploy it in homenet so

330
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,000
srp is a way to

331
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,360
do dnssd advertisements um

332
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,079
that's uh that doesn't rely on um

333
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,959
on uh

334
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,639
multicast cns and however

335
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,240
the reality is right now all of our

336
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
clients are doing multicast dns

337
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,370
and um so

338
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,519
[Music]

339
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,000
uh so we needed a way to and and by the

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
way there's no way to to

341
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
permissionlessly incorporate

342
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,079
a new dns zone into your into your

343
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,599
network configuration so

344
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
so we have to use multicast dns for

345
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,039
advertising right now so

346
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,480
the advertising proxy is sort of the

347
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
other half of the service registration

348
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,439
protocol it's like now we've now we've

349
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,959
got the database how does somebody find

350
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,400
something in the database

351
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,760
right now we're doing that with dns

352
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,720
multicast dns um so that's the

353
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
advertising proxy

354
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,120
uh stuart did a version of that document

355
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,679
and

356
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,240
uh it's pretty complete but it's not

357
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,679
sufficiently detailed so that needs a

358
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,039
fair amount of work

359
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,000
um and then uh additional work that's

360
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,280
been going on this year

361
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,120
is so srp um was originally envisioned

362
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
as something for updating stateful dns

363
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,080
servers

364
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,360
and uh the idea is a stable dns server

365
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,440
has like you know it's on some kind of

366
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,039
reasonably sizable computer there's a

367
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,760
disk drive

368
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
or some kind of flash memory to store

369
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,840
information and so you just do the dns

370
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,360
update and then you can do dns lookups

371
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,480
to that server

372
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
problem is um in reality when you go to

373
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,919
try and deploy this there aren't any dns

374
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,840
servers like that in homes

375
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,520
and so in order to make this work in

376
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,440
homes we need

377
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
something that's equivalently hopefully

378
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,280
equivalently stable to

379
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
a stateful dns server but

380
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
is not doesn't doesn't require that

381
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,640
there be support on the home router

382
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
um and so the way that we did that is

383
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
the idea is that you probably have

384
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,520
multiple um

385
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,080
stub routers in your home that you know

386
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
the example that i would use right now

387
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
would be a homepod mini

388
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,400
all right so homemade midi is a

389
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
subrouter for thread networks

390
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,080
so you have multiple subrouters in your

391
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,559
home is possible at any given time that

392
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,840
one of those subrouters might get

393
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,160
unplugged or whatever but hopefully

394
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,919
at any given time at least one of them

395
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
will be alive so

396
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,520
all of the service registrations that

397
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
occur can be maintained

398
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
by doing replication so that all of the

399
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,080
stub routers in your home network

400
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,600
are sharing the information that they're

401
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,320
getting from srp registrations

402
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,160
any one of the sub routers goes down the

403
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,240
other stub routers take over for it

404
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,720
um you know seamlessly so so that's

405
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,240
that's the goal of replication is for

406
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,840
all the stub routers or

407
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,200
doesn't have to be stub routers but

408
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,480
that's the use case we have right now

409
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,760
for all the subrouters in the home

410
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,559
network

411
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,520
to have the same data so that if any

412
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
stub right any one stub rubber goes away

413
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,280
we don't lose everything

414
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,600
um and then uh the next issue that we

415
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,720
that that i want to talk about is um

416
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
the problem of doing too much multicast

417
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,880
so suppose you've got like an iot

418
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,000
network with

419
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,120
say 50 light bulbs on it and

420
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,520
uh or you know um obviously it's not all

421
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
giving light bulbs but but

422
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,559
just as an example 50 light bulbs um now

423
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,880
when you try to use an advertising proxy

424
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,799
to advertise those 50 light bulbs you

425
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,640
may find that you your performance isn't

426
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,320
that great because advertising proxies

427
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,760
are using multicast and now we've got

428
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
big chunks of data that we're trying to

429
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,039
transfer over multicast

430
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,679
and also multicast dns really wasn't

431
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,799
designed with the idea in mind of

432
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,679
having a single server with 50 answers

433
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,640
um

434
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,360
and so uh in order to work around that

435
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,240
um

436
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
we i've been working actually one of my

437
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,640
colleagues have been working on a

438
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,600
feature

439
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,679
to add the ability to discover

440
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,960
an actual dns server using using mdns

441
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,640
so um so that's the those are the four

442
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,480
pieces that i wanted to talk about

443
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,840
um so let's go to the next slide

444
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,760
okay so um yeah so so

445
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,280
this is this is this is that problem

446
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,720
when you have a lot of devices behind a

447
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,880
stub router the answers get really big

448
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,280
it's not scalable um can we

449
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,240
use multicast more efficiently so rather

450
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,000
than using multicast to transfer all the

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,520
data can we just use multicast to

452
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,840
discover the place where the data is

453
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
and then use unicast to get the data

454
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,400
so what we implemented was exactly that

455
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,120
we have

456
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,840
we basically just advertise an ns record

457
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,240
for

458
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,200
whatever zone it is on the local network

459
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,960
using multicast dns

460
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
and um you know we exclude

461
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,799
actual real dns domains so that we don't

462
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,919
find ourselves

463
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,640
answering questions about you know you

464
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
know bank of america.com or something

465
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,840
bad like that

466
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,880
um and uh and then uh once we've once we

467
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,559
get that ns record advertisement over

468
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,240
multicast dns we can get the

469
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,640
the a record also over multicast dns or

470
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,840
the quad a record

471
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,080
and now we have a connection to a dns

472
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,799
server that will answer for that zone

473
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,120
um so this is something that we've uh

474
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
been working on

475
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
for a while this year we have one

476
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
implementation it's in the mdns

477
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,039
responder project that's not actually

478
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,559
been pushed out yet but it'll be pushed

479
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,640
out soon

480
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,960
and we have actually a fairly good

481
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,320
document but i haven't gotten around to

482
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,679
turning it into an internet draft it's

483
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,280
actually an internal design dock that

484
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,480
needs to be turned into an internet

485
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:02,960
draft

486
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,520
so this is work that i'd like the dnssd

487
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
working group to consider

488
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,440
um i think this is a really useful thing

489
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,039
to be able to do

490
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,760
it'd be nice to have more eyes on it i

491
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,120
think it's relatively

492
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
harmless in the sense that um we're

493
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,320
essentially advertising

494
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
only zones that you would the only

495
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
information that you would

496
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,440
typically be discovering with multicast

497
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,960
dns so

498
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,200
the fact that we're you know advertising

499
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
the availability of a dns server

500
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,000
um using multicast dns which is not in

501
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,440
any way secure might sound a little

502
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,240
alarming but

503
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
but the actual thing we're doing is just

504
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
replacing

505
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
existing multicast dns servers with that

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,360
dns server

507
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,479
um so uh let's go to the next slide

508
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,799
okay so uh service registration protocol

509
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,159
as i mentioned earlier we've got two

510
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,480
open source implementations uh

511
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,440
i did an implementation uh about two

512
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,559
years ago

513
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,480
which matured into what was released in

514
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,760
the homepod mini

515
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,480
um and then independently some folks at

516
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,280
google

517
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,039
did a very nice implementation open

518
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,960
thread which is

519
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,000
uh pretty complete at this point and

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,080
you if you were following the mailing

521
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,840
list you saw the comments that those

522
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
guys had on the document

523
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
and so we made quite a few improvements

524
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,600
to the document the documents had tons

525
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,720
of review

526
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
um we've actually got deployed versions

527
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,640
of this protocol

528
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
um and uh you know so server and the

529
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,039
homepod mini

530
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,480
and there are a bunch of home

531
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
accessories that implement it like you

532
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,880
know

533
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,480
eve you've uh uh

534
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,159
sensors and now leaf light bulbs um

535
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,640
so um i think this document is pretty

536
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,600
close to ready for

537
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,679
your last call probably needs one more

538
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,640
revision but

539
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,720
i think if the working group is willing

540
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
i'd really like to see this finished

541
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,360
um so that's it on srp next slide

542
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
by the way if anybody wants to like you

543
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,279
know chime in and argue about this i'd

544
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:03,679
be

545
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,720
more than happy to argue about it um

546
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
so again for argument um

547
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,799
when you're well yeah we'll open up the

548
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,840
queue for argument

549
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,360
don't worry okay cool so um

550
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,799
so i mentioned the advertising proxy

551
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,799
already stateless it's a stateless

552
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,640
srp registration database that

553
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,320
advertises its contents over

554
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,000
mdns or dnssd um

555
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,400
we have an implementation mdns responder

556
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
i think the open thread guys did one too

557
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,320
but i'm not sure where that

558
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,240
where that is in terms of maturity um

559
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,919
the advertising proxy spec needs a bunch

560
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,919
of work um definitely would appreciate

561
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,840
people reading it and i'd also like to

562
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,039
ask the working group to consider

563
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,480
adopting it

564
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,039
next slide

565
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,720
okay and then srp replication um i

566
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,200
pretty much

567
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,960
already gave you this feel on this uh so

568
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,279
it's a it's a it's a uh my

569
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,799
implementation is a state machine

570
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,320
that um that

571
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,880
you know that runs through the srp

572
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,760
database on

573
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
on the local server and proposes updates

574
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,440
to the remote server

575
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
the road server does the same thing

576
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,960
after after all of those updates have

577
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,679
been done and

578
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,760
principally you're in sync it's possible

579
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,039
that there might be

580
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,960
um conflicts because um the

581
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
if the two servers had been operating

582
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,159
independently

583
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,919
uh one of them might have received an

584
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,120
update that's incompatible with an

585
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,760
update that

586
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,080
the other one received um in that case

587
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
there needs to be some kind of

588
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,880
conflict resolution but we also try to

589
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,640
do conflict avoidance so

590
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,919
when an update comes in we attempt to

591
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,360
update the other server before we

592
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,200
acknowledge the update so if the other

593
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,880
server has a conflict we can report the

594
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,480
conflict back to the client and resolve

595
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
it that way

596
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,840
obviously we can't wait forever for that

597
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
but this gives us

598
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,960
um a nice uh the nice quality that that

599
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,480
most of the time we can expect things to

600
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,919
work correctly occasionally we'll see

601
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
some glitches but they should resolve

602
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,320
quickly

603
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,080
you know within within the least time of

604
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
an srp update

605
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,320
so the goal here is not perfection the

606
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
goal is to make something that works

607
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,799
really well

608
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,240
and um and that when it fails

609
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,000
fails in a way that that ultimately

610
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,679
produces um

611
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
you know a good result that is to say

612
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,039
the failure gets gets sort of

613
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,559
automatically cleaned up

614
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,640
um so the experience you would have on

615
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
this is basically just that

616
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
um you know you're going to see

617
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,400
hopefully hopefully right now with the

618
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,919
existing srp implementation you're not

619
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
seeing a whole lot of instability with

620
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,960
with name registrations but this will

621
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
make the name registrations a whole

622
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,159
bunch more stable

623
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,679
so you get better reliability better

624
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,000
user experience um

625
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,400
i haven't described this this thing to

626
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,600
anyone else so

627
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
as far as i know it would be kind of

628
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
surprising if anybody else has done an

629
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,159
implementation i need to write a

630
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,440
document i have a

631
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,880
an outline of a document but i haven't

632
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
written a document yet but it just

633
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,320
describes what the protocol does

634
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
um i think the protocol probably needs a

635
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,080
whole bunch of eyes on it i think it

636
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,600
would be good to get some criticism of

637
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,279
it

638
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,799
after having done the implementation i

639
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,320
already had some ideas for what i would

640
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,440
do differently and

641
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,760
um it's not casting concrete at this

642
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,440
point so it'd be great to

643
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,679
to uh to get some working group eyes on

644
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,960
that um

645
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,159
so that's that's my next thing um and

646
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,799
the next slide

647
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,600
okay i think let me just go through my

648
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,960
copy of the slides and make sure that

649
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,320
there are any other slides we should be

650
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,879
talking about

651
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,320
no that's it so uh i guess at this point

652
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,159
this will be the time to discuss these

653
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,919
these slides and whether the working

654
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,120
group's interested in this work

655
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,240
okay so as you said oh yeah i got audio

656
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,760
um there was a whole lot of discussion

657
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,279
on i guess it was the srp draft

658
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,559
um and

659
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,080
i'd like to yeah open up the

660
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,960
microphone for anybody who has further

661
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,679
comments

662
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,279
or who would like to um

663
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,919
voice their support ted has asked that

664
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,080
this go to working group last call so if

665
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,679
you have technical comments

666
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,799
or questions on the srp replication or

667
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,600
if you have

668
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440
administrative comments like we would

669
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,279
love to see this go to last call and we

670
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,320
think it's ready

671
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,039
that would be welcome since ted is here

672
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,159
the mic is also

673
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,480
open for the other drafts there's the

674
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,440
draft you'd like

675
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,960
to um suggest that we adopt

676
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,360
um and then i think you know just

677
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,720
technical comments

678
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,240
on the srp replication because

679
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
that's not ready for adoption or

680
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,600
anything

681
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,840
so my line is open

682
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,360
this could be oh esko

683
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,960
please yeah i was just wondering for

684
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,360
srp replication was there already a

685
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,760
published draft for that

686
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,159
no uh that's that's basically work that

687
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,120
i

688
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,039
have just been working on it's it's the

689
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,559
reason why these slides are so

690
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,679
uh okay why do slides were so late so

691
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,840
yeah that that i have a i have an

692
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
outline of a document that describes the

693
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,120
current implementation

694
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,120
and uh i should be able to get that

695
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,919
ready

696
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,440
uh within the next month so um

697
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,520
so that's that's the level of maturity

698
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,799
right now which is to say not much

699
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,720
okay so that's that's coming up yeah and

700
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,919
then for srp

701
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,480
uh i had one one thing in mind you

702
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,279
mentioned that

703
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,279
before the working group last call could

704
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,640
be done you wanted to have

705
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,000
probably one more vision right

706
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,760
yeah and i think that that

707
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,279
at least fits well in my schedule

708
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,880
because i would like to check

709
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,120
the latest version to see if the the

710
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,039
review comments i had or addressed so i

711
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:57,520
didn't

712
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,640
get around that yet okay maybe i can do

713
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,480
that just before the

714
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,480
the next revision uh yeah yeah i i'd

715
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,240
like to get that one revised quickly and

716
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,679
get it to last call quickly

717
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,520
um we've done a whole bunch of work on

718
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
it people it's in people's cash right

719
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,399
now i don't want it to fall out of

720
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:15,760
everybody's cash

721
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,200
so um so basically um

722
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,120
and then speaking of falling out of cash

723
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,559
um i think there are

724
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,880
a little there are a few more uh edits i

725
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
need to make to the document based on

726
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,080
the most recent comments

727
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,520
about uh uh deletion

728
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,880
of srp updates um

729
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,000
but i haven't i'm not positive i i know

730
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,640
that i

731
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
i the document has a bunch of text about

732
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,760
that already

733
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
and so it may be that i've already done

734
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,120
all of those in which case there isn't a

735
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,799
whole lot more for me to do but let me

736
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,640
just do a pass through my mailbox and

737
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,120
make sure

738
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,679
that before uh and then you know if

739
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,200
that's the case i'll do a rev and then

740
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,080
you can

741
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,399
look at the at that document and review

742
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,279
that document

743
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,600
and you know working with last call

744
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,960
doesn't mean we're done working

745
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,720
group last call is please review this

746
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,000
document one more time so

747
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,279
it would be perfectly fine if you were

748
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,919
here at that point okay

749
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,240
that's right i really appreciate your

750
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,039
comments by the way

751
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,720
thanks so ted we're gonna wait on you

752
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,559
publishing one more revision before we

753
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,480
start the workflow

754
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,760
all right sounds good and for the

755
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,720
other documents uh before we even start

756
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,559
talking about adoption we would like

757
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,360
to know that the document exists so

758
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,320
so advertising proxy exists and that was

759
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,840
the one you were asking about

760
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,080
adoption yeah

761
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,000
the the other one is the work in

762
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,559
progress that uh is still a gleam in

763
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,159
ted's eye

764
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,840
right yeah i'm not i'm not asking the

765
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,360
working group to adopt those documents

766
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,240
cite unseen

767
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,840
you're not

768
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,880
yep eric uh you have something you'd

769
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
like to say

770
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,320
yes thank you so more about this srp

771
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,440
replication i understand it's still not

772
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,799
in the air completely because they are

773
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,760
code existing

774
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,679
can you shed some lights on it are you

775
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,320
using dns replication like zone transfer

776
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,760
between zones or how do these they

777
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,360
discover each other

778
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,440
yeah so yeah i can talk about that a bit

779
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,960
it's actually implemented using dns

780
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,880
stateful operations um

781
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,640
i thought about using zone transfers for

782
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,399
this but the problem is zone transfers

783
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,399
the way that zone transfers work is that

784
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,440
they rely on

785
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,679
a on an agreed-upon um

786
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
serial number for the zone and so

787
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,039
basically uh that makes zone transfers

788
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,559
work really well because when somebody

789
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,240
says you know i have this serial number

790
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,440
can you can you give me everything

791
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
that's changed since this serial number

792
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,000
you just get this

793
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,640
small change set and it's really clean

794
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,039
but

795
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,519
um that doesn't work so well with

796
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,960
stateless servers because there's no way

797
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,840
to there we

798
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,480
don't have like a a primary server in

799
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,080
secondaries everybody is printing

800
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,000
principle just as primary as everybody

801
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,640
else

802
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,399
or just as secondary as everybody else

803
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,080
and so using zone transfers

804
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,440
just didn't look like it was going to

805
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,360
work that's how i wanted to do it but it

806
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,720
just didn't make sense

807
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,279
so um there are a couple of assumptions

808
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,880
in the protocol and these may actually

809
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,000
be bad assumptions and

810
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,679
worth investigating one of them is that

811
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,760
there's probably not a gigantic

812
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,559
database because if you have a gigantic

813
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,320
database you probably want that to be in

814
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
a real dns server

815
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,640
so this is really more for the sort of

816
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,960
you know

817
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,600
uh home environment where you might have

818
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,720
50 or 100

819
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,960
things in the database not thousands or

820
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,720
tens of thousands or millions of things

821
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,760
in the database

822
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,200
and so um making the protocol efficient

823
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,559
in the way that incremental zone

824
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,000
transfers are

825
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,039
isn't as high a priority because the you

826
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:55,919
know

827
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,919
you could get into a situation where you

828
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,360
have um

829
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,919
you know kind of an n probably not n

830
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,679
squared but maybe n log n kind of

831
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,679
traversal across the database

832
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,399
and in if if that was gonna be millions

833
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,839
of records you really wouldn't want to

834
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,639
do that

835
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,359
but um that's not the case here so so

836
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,760
the way that it works is really stupid

837
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,159
and um and that's sort of by design

838
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,760
right i'm not trying to do like a super

839
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
fancy

840
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,040
you know uh state synchronization

841
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,199
protocol with three phase commits and

842
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,639
stuff like that um but uh but basically

843
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,159
to just do a you know

844
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,839
let me see what you have here's what i

845
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,520
have and

846
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,359
let's you know i'll take the new things

847
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,639
that i haven't heard of from you

848
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,199
and and you know all of the sort of the

849
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,719
the things that you would be concerned

850
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,119
about

851
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,199
like you know what happens if um

852
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,359
i get a uh a dns update

853
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,399
or an update from um from a server

854
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,399
just as an update is coming in from a

855
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,560
client that's for the same record

856
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,960
um and uh you know how do i avoid like

857
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,200
when i get an update from the server not

858
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,640
seeing that as the same thing that i

859
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,240
have to send back to the other server

860
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
and getting into a loop that way so

861
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
there's all kinds of stuff like that but

862
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,400
uh but the basic replication protocol is

863
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,160
its own thing and as i said it's really

864
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,480
stupid it's pretty easy to implement

865
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,440
my state machine is on the order of

866
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,599
maybe 1500 lines of code

867
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,560
so um and actually i'm kind of

868
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,720
suspecting that it could be made simpler

869
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,240
and that's the direction that i would

870
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,240
tend to want to go if we have to go in

871
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,040
the direction

872
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,520
of remembering states

873
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,440
so that we can do incremental transfers

874
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,280
based on based on differences between

875
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,000
states

876
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,119
i think that's a whole different topic

877
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,040
possibly an interesting topic because we

878
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
haven't really solved that problem for

879
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
dns as a whole yet

880
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,599
um but uh

881
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,119
that's not really the problem i want to

882
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,640
work on in this

883
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,160
unless we discover that we really have

884
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
to work on it i'd much rather work on a

885
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,879
simpler problem

886
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,680
okay so

887
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,839
um for the srp

888
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,680
you're going we're going to wait for

889
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,599
another update

890
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,079
and then we'll start a wglc on that

891
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,520
um we'll send an email out to people

892
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,839
asking them to comment on the

893
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,000
advertising proxy

894
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,480
um just to gauge i think some interest

895
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,359
in it

896
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,560
um and if there's

897
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,960
interest then we can put out a call for

898
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,320
adoption

899
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,079
but i'd like to at least see some

900
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,920
discussion on it i think

901
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,359
david what are your thoughts

902
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,800
i definitely agree i don't think there's

903
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
been enough discussion for us to start

904
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,000
adoption right now

905
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
so let's see ted if you can maybe drop a

906
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,839
drum up some interest on the list

907
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,560
and uh with that we can move to an

908
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,000
adoption call

909
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,119
sounds good and we'll wait

910
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,200
for a draft looking forward to a draft

911
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,680
on

912
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,799
srp duplication um

913
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,839
replication okay

914
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,520
and i think then

915
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,240
that really is a summary of all of the

916
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,200
work we have

917
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,400
going on in dnssb

918
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,480
uh do we want you know we had said that

919
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,359
uh home net would uh start at the top of

920
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,000
the next

921
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,800
hour do we want to take a five minute

922
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,480
break while we send out an

923
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,000
email to the home net list

924
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280
that we're going to be starting at let's

925
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,079
say at 45 past the hour with home net

926
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,119
and then start then

927
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,640
yeah you know i i it might be that

928
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,040
so daniel migos draft for home net is

929
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,000
actually

930
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,119
very relevant to dnssd so it might be

931
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,480
good to start with his because if

932
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,079
there's if there are any stragglers that

933
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,520
are just interested in the routing stuff

934
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,359
they'll probably

935
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,280
you know i suspect the dns people are

936
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,520
already here

937
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,440
well and they can stay here your your

938
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
stub network is actually pretty

939
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,720
interesting so i think we'll just

940
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,160
proceed with our

941
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,280
regular plan um but

942
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,680
we'll uh i'll send out an email to the

943
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
home net list that will start at 45

944
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,440
minutes past the hour

945
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,400
we'll take a small break and reconvene

946
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,480
at 45 past the hour and get going on

947
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,240
home net and stephen is that okay with

948
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,800
you two

949
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,720
uh pretty much yeah i think i like ted's

950
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,880
suggestion maybe to look to maybe

951
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,560
flip the homeless agenda so that ted's

952
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,160
sloth which is the kind of new thing

953
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,680
that might attract people it does

954
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,800
actually start around the top of the

955
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,760
hour

956
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,400
so if you do daniel michael first that

957
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
might make more sense

958
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,280
eric does that kind of chime with the

959
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,560
interest you had in this topic

960
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,720
yeah okay so we started 45 with

961
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,520
let's say michael and daniel assuming

962
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,240
they're available

963
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,520
[Music]

964
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,240
we'll start at 45 with the formal agenda

965
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,880
bashing

966
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,359
in which case we'll have that proposal

967
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,560
and then we'll get started

968
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,240
okay more coffee more coffee

969
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,799
okay um at 45 let's see

970
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,599
i'm going to escape these

971
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,720
i'm sure i can do this

972
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,880
okay and y'all are all free to come back

973
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,000
at 45 and

974
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:11,839
um i'll send an email first

975
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,119
so barbara if it's some stage you want

976
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,359
me to present then i can do that

977
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:01,520
uh if you rather do that's fine too

978
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,640
so i've got these things up and

979
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,720
i think i can

980
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,079
show them let me see

981
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,200
uh and i guess stuart are you willing to

982
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,799
keep on helping with uh

983
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,599
with minutes we'll continue doing that

984
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,319
seriously again

985
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,079
i said yes i will continue taking notes

986
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:30,800
i have not

987
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,920
used this code md tool before

988
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,920
are the edits i'm doing now are they

989
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,240
showing it visibly to everybody else

990
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,599
yeah it looks good to me yep okay and so

991
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:43,599
just keeping under the same file or page

992
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:44,079
or whatever

993
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,200
is just fine we can text thanks amanda

994
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,800
so thanks uh let's go ahead then and get

995
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,760
started

996
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,880
um home net session

997
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,280
um where session one not two but other

998
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,119
than that i think i got things mostly

999
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,400
accurate

1000
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,920
um again we are still

1001
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,880
under the note well which was already

1002
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,200
shown at the start of the dns sd but

1003
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,279
here it is again note it well

1004
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,440
and the agenda this was the

1005
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,079
overarching agenda for the two sessions

1006
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:22,960
um we did

1007
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,240
go ahead and have ted lemon talk about

1008
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,319
the uh let's see

1009
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,480
oh no this is just the home net agenda

1010
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,319
right so the home net agenda

1011
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,079
we had initially put ted on first but

1012
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,400
ted and others have suggested that if

1013
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,079
daniel and michael

1014
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,640
are open to starting that it would

1015
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,240
probably be useful

1016
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,280
if they went first

1017
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,760
on the aspects of the the delegating

1018
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,200
names so

1019
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,240
daniel would it be okay with you

1020
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,119
if we swapped the order and you went

1021
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,280
first

1022
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,960
oh yeah no problem at all okay

1023
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,640
then that's what we're going to do and

1024
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,559
we'll have the wrap up at the end

1025
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,400
um we did go ahead stewart is going to

1026
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,839
continue with notes

1027
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,800
um just a quick comment on some document

1028
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,440
status

1029
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,119
items the uh the babel profile is not

1030
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,520
yet published it is still waiting

1031
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,759
specifically for the um

1032
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,160
the the babel item on the

1033
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,000
oh what was the name of that it's just

1034
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,280
so early um

1035
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,000
the uh source address you know source

1036
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,599
right source specific

1037
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,240
um which i think julius said that his

1038
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,400
current intention is actually

1039
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,960
that technically it's correct he said

1040
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,599
but it's

1041
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,760
very poorly written written in his

1042
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,480
opinion and so he intends to rewrite it

1043
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,240
and he'd like then for it to go all the

1044
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,640
way back through

1045
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,119
wglc and ietf

1046
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,240
lc and all of that so um that one may be

1047
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,359
a while

1048
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,640
um with that i'm going to then

1049
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:17,359
bring up daniel's slides

1050
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,078
let me see

1051
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,119
hi everyone

1052
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,000
so i i think i'm gonna be very brief

1053
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,040
with the two

1054
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,319
draft on that um so we are

1055
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,960
um three percent very actively working

1056
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,079
on those and

1057
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,760
um regularly chatting um

1058
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,640
on it we we try to report what we're

1059
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,800
doing on the mailing list as well

1060
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:58,160
um but here it is next slide

1061
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,640
so just a quick reminder about what

1062
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,079
we're doing

1063
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,160
um so we're basically defining how

1064
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,520
um a home net can outsource the dns

1065
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,319
service to

1066
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,079
um another infrastructure

1067
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,559
and we designate this infrastructure the

1068
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,440
dns outsourcing infrastructure

1069
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,559
um and so and the

1070
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,040
the entity within the home net that is

1071
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,960
uh orchestrating this um

1072
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,359
outsourcing infrastructure is called the

1073
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,400
home naming

1074
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,119
authority which is designed designated

1075
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,200
at hna

1076
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,800
so in a home net there are basically

1077
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,040
two kind of zones um the forward zone

1078
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,119
which here i represented with home

1079
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,640
net.example

1080
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,520
and you also have um the the reverse

1081
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,000
zone

1082
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,359
which is here ip.ipv6

1083
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,920
dot opera so

1084
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,400
in this environment the isp has

1085
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,520
a specific position

1086
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,720
mostly because for the river zone the

1087
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,119
isp is providing the ip address

1088
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,280
and is also responsible for the reverse

1089
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,559
zone

1090
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,559
and in most cases isp

1091
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,599
already assigns a name to

1092
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,040
cpes for example so um

1093
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,000
the isp is likely to play a significant

1094
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,559
role in that

1095
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,720
so given that next slide

1096
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,240
so we ended up in two drafts

1097
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
well ended up a long time ago but the

1098
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,240
first one is really describing the

1099
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,440
architecture

1100
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,480
and how an home net can outsource its

1101
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,440
own

1102
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,960
a dns zone reverse or forward

1103
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,000
to a dns outsourcing infrastructure

1104
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,680
um there is no assumption about who

1105
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,200
is that dns outsourcing infrastructure

1106
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,559
it could be

1107
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,040
a third party that's the party we we

1108
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,240
took but it could be

1109
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,319
the asp as well and then

1110
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,559
because in this kind of environment the

1111
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,440
isp

1112
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,040
has a special role um we

1113
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,319
we we defined it as second draft

1114
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,559
which helps and he's how an isp

1115
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:33,200
can is the configuration of the

1116
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,040
home net naming authority uh using dhcp

1117
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,680
and and so this is why we have this uh

1118
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,040
naming architecture

1119
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,880
uh dhc options so it's clearly

1120
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,559
only intended to help the communications

1121
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,200
between the

1122
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,400
an isp and a cpe uh

1123
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:01,119
that is using a dhcp next slide

1124
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,800
so um so for the front hand um

1125
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,079
um i mean the document

1126
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,520
is a i mean uh relatively stable now

1127
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,640
we're working on an implementation and

1128
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,839
currently um i'm saying it's michael

1129
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,760
because he's not here probably

1130
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,880
so he has the ball he's polishing his

1131
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,000
implementation

1132
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,640
and we will take the feedbacks from the

1133
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,720
implementation to um

1134
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,760
to the draft um so that we can check

1135
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,280
everything that works um

1136
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,599
as we expect for the dhcp options

1137
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,640
um we we

1138
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,640
we had some discussions um on the

1139
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,760
mailing list and we

1140
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,040
recently changed the design um so the

1141
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,920
the change we

1142
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,359
we made is that um for the previous

1143
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:52,319
years

1144
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:55,359
um the hna

1145
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,880
was supposed to provide the key

1146
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,920
that's going to be used um to be

1147
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,359
authenticated uh

1148
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,119
to authenticate the hnf uh to from the

1149
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,599
dns outsourcing infrastructure so

1150
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,599
basically

1151
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,640
the previous scheme was the hna

1152
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,040
is providing the credentials via dhcp

1153
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,079
that are going to be used and

1154
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,960
transmitted to the doe and so that the

1155
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,839
goe can

1156
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,200
authenticate the hna um

1157
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,559
it has been shown that such

1158
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,119
cons such way of working is um

1159
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,319
i'm i could say insecure or at least

1160
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,799
does not really make any operations

1161
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:45,839
sense

1162
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:49,520
because dhcp also dhep can provide some

1163
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,240
response

1164
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,959
that are

1165
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,520
adapted to a specific client

1166
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,960
but dhcp is not being used to upload

1167
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,720
some configurations from the network

1168
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,359
to the call network in which case uh in

1169
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,160
this case

1170
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,559
the dns outsourcing infrastructure could

1171
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,200
be um

1172
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,559
seen as the call network or upstream

1173
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:17,440
network

1174
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,960
so what we ended up with we removed this

1175
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,240
option public key um

1176
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,359
from the the current specification so

1177
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,240
we believe that i mean the intent is

1178
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,040
that

1179
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,720
the isp when is using dhep he knows who

1180
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,400
he's talking to

1181
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,040
i mean he's able to authenticate he

1182
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,480
knows which line which

1183
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,760
client customer is um on

1184
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,920
on the other side of the wire and so

1185
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,920
there is no need to

1186
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,480
provide this public key from the hna

1187
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,599
next slide i think that's all

1188
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,280
but i just want to make sure

1189
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,839
yeah so this is what i just explained

1190
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,640
yeah so this is where we are

1191
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,400
i don't want to say that we're going to

1192
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,200
be done by next ietf

1193
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,880
but we're slowly

1194
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,480
slowly moving toward that um

1195
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,359
final stage

1196
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,839
and so right now you have the only

1197
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:28,720
implementation

1198
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,920
is that right so no the

1199
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,319
the only implementation is a from ray

1200
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,799
hunter

1201
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,400
okay any so it would be nice if we did

1202
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,359
also

1203
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:45,280
have additional implementations and i

1204
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,880
think that applies to

1205
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,440
ted's draft as well that it would be

1206
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:49,920
nice

1207
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,000
if we got additional people trying to

1208
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,319
implement um

1209
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,839
ted's efforts in dnssd um

1210
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,920
and so you think maybe another revision

1211
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,480
and then you'd like to try for a working

1212
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,400
group last call

1213
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,720
um and we're going to have an

1214
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,319
overarching discussion

1215
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,200
about i guess things in home net and

1216
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,319
trying to make sure we get enough

1217
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,359
review and support at the end of this

1218
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,520
session and so we'll hold off that

1219
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,760
discussion till

1220
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,079
does anyone um the queue is open does

1221
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:30,079
anyone have questions or comments for

1222
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,480
daniel

1223
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,720
okay so we'll have that discussion about

1224
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,440
where

1225
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,280
this work should live in order to make

1226
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,280
sure it gets sufficient review

1227
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,440
um after we hear from ted

1228
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,440
um if no one has any questions or

1229
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,839
comments for daniel

1230
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,520
okay um then if it's okay i will

1231
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:09,839
bring up ted's again

1232
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,440
daniel actually uh you said there's an

1233
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,240
implementation

1234
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,559
is that available and if so could you

1235
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,760
just send a mail to the list or

1236
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,960
something with the pointer

1237
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,799
um yeah i i mean it's available

1238
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,240
somewhere but i can't

1239
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,078
i don't i don't really know where

1240
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,760
tomorrow is fine okay okay right

1241
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,839
great thank you

1242
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,319
okay should i get started yeah

1243
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,960
all right uh so i'm gonna talk about the

1244
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,119
sort of the whole stub networks problem

1245
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,799
um are you hearing me

1246
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,359
yeah hi just before ted starts

1247
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:10,960
i wanted to take this opportunity to

1248
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,880
thank ted for his

1249
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:16,559
amazing work on this uh 18 months ago

1250
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,240
apple asked us to look into doing home

1251
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,480
kit over thread

1252
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,359
and what we found was that the the big

1253
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:23,680
gap

1254
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,720
in thread is they have they didn't have

1255
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,640
a border router the equivalent wi-fi

1256
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,000
access point the thing that

1257
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,599
connects your thread network to your

1258
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,359
home network

1259
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,200
and just bridging that like the way you

1260
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,480
do with wi-fi

1261
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,280
would overwhelm the slow threat network

1262
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,720
so

1263
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,839
uh ted's work on srp plus the stub v6

1264
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:48,000
networks is what made that possible

1265
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,960
and ted you know in addition to working

1266
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,799
on documents did amazing work in one

1267
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:54,720
year writing the code to go from concept

1268
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,400
to shipping product

1269
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,880
so that was pretty incredible we shipped

1270
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,720
homepod many last november there's

1271
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,559
already a bunch of third-party homekit

1272
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,400
accessories running over thread

1273
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,640
using srp and the stub networks work

1274
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,079
of course we don't it just to be the

1275
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,680
homepod mini we don't want to see a

1276
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,280
whole market full of

1277
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,680
uh other third-party border routers and

1278
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,359
that's why standardizing this work is

1279
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,319
really important

1280
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,760
but i wanted to thank ted for his

1281
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,440
amazing work over the last 12 months

1282
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,240
getting that shipped

1283
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,760
yeah that's why i have rings under my

1284
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,079
eyes

1285
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:33,520
um and late slides anyway uh so

1286
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,240
what i want to talk about is um is

1287
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,920
exactly what stuart just described

1288
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,480
uh sort of the permissionless adding of

1289
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,200
a

1290
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,880
stub networks to existing network

1291
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,040
infrastructure in order to deliver

1292
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,200
uh uh reachability and discoverability

1293
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,799
to the devices that are on the stub

1294
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,319
network um

1295
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:53,680
and from the devices that are on the

1296
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,440
stub network so

1297
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,200
um so just to clarify what a stub

1298
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,040
network is it's a leaf node there's no

1299
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:01,920
through traffic

1300
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,119
um stub network is not a transit network

1301
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,400
in any sense

1302
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,760
um it connects to uh adjacent

1303
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,040
an adjacent network and there needs to

1304
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,480
be some way to get packets

1305
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:17,440
between the two networks um both

1306
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,119
directions obviously

1307
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,400
and uh it needs to be possible

1308
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,839
to discover devices on the stub network

1309
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,240
from the adjacent network and ideally

1310
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,160
from the adjacent network

1311
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,839
discovered by on the adjacent network

1312
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,440
from the stub network

1313
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,280
um so essentially the idea here

1314
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,200
you know considering the use case that

1315
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,559
stuart just described

1316
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,319
the idea is that my uh

1317
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,640
in the case of of homepod may probably

1318
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,160
be a home kit accessory right my home

1319
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,480
kit accessory that's connected to the

1320
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,119
the stun network through the homepod

1321
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,480
mini

1322
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,480
has the same user experience the same

1323
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,799
discoverability the same reachability

1324
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,559
as an equivalent device that was

1325
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,319
connected directly to the wi-fi that was

1326
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,359
our goal

1327
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,400
um so so that's like the minimal

1328
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,000
required functionality

1329
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,880
gets us basically what we need um and

1330
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,559
then additional functionality

1331
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,160
some devices need to be able to reach

1332
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,319
out to the cloud um

1333
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,480
maybe for firmware updates maybe because

1334
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,079
it's like a cloud-based

1335
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,760
iot service not a home-based iot service

1336
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,400
um so reachability of the cloud and when

1337
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,760
i say reachability cloud

1338
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,280
i'm talking about the equivalent

1339
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,039
functionality you have now

1340
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,680
in a matted home network where uh

1341
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,039
devices that are sitting on your home

1342
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:37,039
network are not reachable from the cloud

1343
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,559
you can't like some server out in the

1344
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:39,680
cloud is not going to be able to make a

1345
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,359
tcp connection to a device on your home

1346
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:42,799
network but the device on the home

1347
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:43,599
network

1348
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,440
can make a tcp connection out to a

1349
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,960
device on the cloud

1350
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,599
um and so that's that's what i mean by

1351
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,880
reachability of the cloud

1352
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,079
full routing would be uh you know

1353
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,079
there's two aspects to full routing so

1354
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,680
you've got adjacent

1355
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,799
now an adjacent network um

1356
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,559
would be just like a link that's that

1357
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,160
the stub network is directly connected

1358
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,599
to the sub router is directly connected

1359
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:06,640
to that link

1360
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,839
um you could also have non-adjacent

1361
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,280
networks that are reachable and that's

1362
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,200
what full routing is about so that means

1363
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
reachability suppose you've got a at

1364
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,880
home network or this is a small office

1365
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,240
network or maybe a commercial

1366
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,119
building network um and you want to be

1367
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,359
able to discover and reach devices

1368
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:26,640
on the stub network from

1369
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,839
the uh from anywhere on the on the

1370
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,039
multiple subnet

1371
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,400
lan and vice versa that would be full

1372
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,280
routing

1373
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,839
and then uh in order for that to really

1374
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,440
work well then you need

1375
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,280
probably some dns infrastructure that's

1376
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,200
being updated rather than

1377
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,440
you know the uh the advertising proxy

1378
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,680
stuff that uh that i discussed earlier

1379
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,960
we'll be going over the stuff i

1380
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,400
discussed earlier in case there are late

1381
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,920
comers who didn't hear that

1382
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,079
um so that's the goal is basically

1383
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,240
first of all minimal functionality just

1384
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,160
just the equivalent of what's available

1385
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:00,480
now

1386
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,319
only with your devices that are one hop

1387
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,319
away and then ideally

1388
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,240
full mesh routing and all the sort of

1389
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,920
things that you would expect from

1390
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,359
from a home net and in fact

1391
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:12,960
it's because the the minimal

1392
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,039
functionality is a building block

1393
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:17,760
in the direction of uh the functionality

1394
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,440
that we wanted for home net that i think

1395
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,280
this is relevant to home net

1396
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,799
uh i think this is actually like the

1397
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,160
problem well i'll talk about it in a

1398
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,160
little bit let's go to the next slide

1399
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,079
getting ahead of myself so how we got

1400
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,079
here uh so we started out

1401
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,240
trying to do everything right we wanted

1402
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:33,920
the full mesh topology for

1403
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,760
for uh you know we wanted to

1404
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,280
automatically discover the

1405
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,000
the entire home network mesh we wanted

1406
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,599
full mesh routing we wanted full mesh

1407
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,200
naming

1408
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,439
that was a really hard problem um

1409
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,280
even figuring out how we wanted the

1410
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,880
naming architecture to look was hard

1411
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,079
because some people wanted

1412
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,680
wanted one thing and some people wanted

1413
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,760
another and we had lots of discussions

1414
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,280
about that and never really came to

1415
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,559
consensus

1416
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,599
uh hncp was published but um

1417
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:03,119
it never you know stuart was talking

1418
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,480
about the work that it takes to get a

1419
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,680
product to market

1420
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:09,039
um getting the the spec to the point

1421
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,559
where you think it'll work

1422
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,240
is a very different thing than getting

1423
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,680
the product to market and actually

1424
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,480
having it

1425
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,880
be usable by people and we never got

1426
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,079
there with hncp

1427
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,720
hncp was originally motivated by isps

1428
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,559
who wanted

1429
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,079
full mesh routing in the home and and so

1430
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,680
but the problem was that it took too

1431
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,160
long and there wasn't like there wasn't

1432
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,559
momentum in the home router community

1433
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,039
and so that enthusiasm on the isp side

1434
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,799
never translated into implementations on

1435
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,400
the home router side and so basically we

1436
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,240
did all this work and we didn't

1437
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,480
at least thus far we haven't gotten

1438
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,680
anything out of it

1439
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,760
um and so you know the babel work has

1440
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,039
been proceeding and that's been really

1441
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:50,880
cool um

1442
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,039
i have high hopes for that work actually

1443
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,960
i'd like it if that work could become

1444
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,480
part of the stuff that we've been doing

1445
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:56,880
with

1446
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,039
with stub networks i think that that

1447
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,640
would make stub networks a lot more

1448
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,599
useful

1449
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,960
because right now suppose you have two

1450
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,480
stub networks and can connect to the

1451
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,000
same adjacent infrastructure

1452
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,520
you have reachability to both of those

1453
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,119
sub networks you have discoverability on

1454
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,640
both of those networks but suppose a

1455
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,920
device on stuff network a

1456
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,280
wants to configure a device instead of

1457
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,280
network b how do you do that

1458
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,400
you have to have routing in that

1459
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,880
direction too and uh you know we can

1460
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,000
sort of do that with router

1461
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,200
advertisements but it'd be

1462
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,119
way better to have a real routing

1463
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,319
protocol so

1464
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:27,680
um anyway so so

1465
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,039
the point i'm getting to here is that i

1466
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,119
think we actually like starting with the

1467
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:32,079
top down

1468
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,920
approach we kind of ran into the best as

1469
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,920
the enemy of good enough fallacy

1470
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,640
and uh that's how we got here so next

1471
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,960
slide

1472
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,000
so uh basically where we've been going

1473
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:48,880
recently

1474
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,880
and you know talk a little bit about how

1475
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,880
this started stuart and i were in

1476
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,720
were at a thread meeting in munich a

1477
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,079
couple of years ago

1478
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,920
uh actually i think it was a year and a

1479
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,920
half ago maybe two years ago

1480
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,520
and we were talking about like how do we

1481
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,599
get this stuff into homes

1482
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,799
how do we actually deploy multiple

1483
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:07,520
subnet

1484
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,359
home networks because we have to have

1485
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,119
multiple subnet home networks for iot i

1486
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:11,599
mean

1487
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,000
it was a nice idea for like general

1488
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,520
purpose but for iot it's absolutely

1489
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,839
required how do we get this into homes

1490
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,599
and so um

1491
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:23,599
how do we how do we in a permissionless

1492
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,920
way deploy an existing infrastructure

1493
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,280
and so that's where we came up with the

1494
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,880
requirements that i described earlier we

1495
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,520
have to

1496
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,079
we have to have equivalent functionality

1497
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:32,720
to

1498
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,960
uh devices on the home network and it

1499
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,200
needs to support existing use patterns

1500
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,200
uh if if something worked for a device

1501
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,640
that was connected directly to your home

1502
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,359
network

1503
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,119
it should work if it's connected to your

1504
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,720
to your iot network

1505
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,039
um just to be clear i'm not saying that

1506
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:48,799
stub routers are just for iot it's just

1507
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:49,920
that that's the use case that we

1508
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,920
exploited to to

1509
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,960
to come up with a solution uh so

1510
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,839
next slide

1511
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,760
so uh what we have now uh there are two

1512
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:03,520
stud network implementations the homepod

1513
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:04,480
mini has

1514
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,039
a complete uh implementation of the

1515
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,720
basic functionality that i described

1516
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:09,680
earlier

1517
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,359
and open thread at this point i don't

1518
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:12,960
know if it's merged into open thread yet

1519
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,920
but we have

1520
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,279
a really nice um implementation of the

1521
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,120
srp stuff the in open thread

1522
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:24,960
and uh you know i think that

1523
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,640
uh that at this point the open thread

1524
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:29,120
guys also have routing working

1525
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,600
um so that would that those are the two

1526
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,719
bits of a stub network

1527
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,520
you know routing and discoverability um

1528
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,479
so these are

1529
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,479
in independent implementations i didn't

1530
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,679
actually talk to the guys

1531
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:41,920
other than basically the conversations

1532
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,520
that we had um

1533
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,759
on the mailing list that that so this

1534
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,759
was on the dns's dmail and so if any of

1535
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:48,080
you

1536
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,759
were on the dns emailings you probably

1537
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:51,359
saw those conversations

1538
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,920
um so so we have these two

1539
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,359
implementations they are not

1540
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,640
full implementations they don't do

1541
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,560
everything they're evolving but they

1542
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,080
deliver the functionality we need we can

1543
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,520
control accessories that are connected

1544
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,040
to the stub network we can discover

1545
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,080
accessories that are connected to the

1546
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,040
stud network

1547
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,640
and so on next slide

1548
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,359
so um this is this is a little bit of a

1549
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,238
wish here i'm not

1550
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,319
this is like where i would like to see

1551
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,920
this go

1552
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,279
i'm not convinced this is where it's

1553
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,880
going to go but but i'm mentioning this

1554
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,158
because i think that if

1555
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:25,920
this is an interest home net this is

1556
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,120
probably a direction that we might want

1557
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,479
to consider going

1558
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,600
um and that is can we scale up this stub

1559
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,279
network solution can we use this as a

1560
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,479
building block

1561
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,279
to uh to actually get to the point where

1562
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,960
we have a complete home net solution and

1563
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,719
not just stub networks

1564
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:42,880
so in order to do that we need to add

1565
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,839
babel

1566
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,640
uh we probably want to to have srp on

1567
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:49,279
the edge router

1568
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,120
and we need some way to get prefixes to

1569
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,600
internal routers that could be dhcp v6

1570
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,960
it could be hmcp problem with using dhcp

1571
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:01,600
v6

1572
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,280
is that dhcp v6 binds

1573
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,360
an id to a specific ip address to a

1574
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:10,640
delegated prefix

1575
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,159
and there isn't actually a way to set up

1576
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,560
routing so babel might solve that

1577
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,440
problem

1578
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,440
uh if we can advertise routes in babel

1579
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,960
maybe we don't need to solve the problem

1580
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,520
of how

1581
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,000
how routing is set up but we still have

1582
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,920
a problem that only one thing can own a

1583
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,960
prefix

1584
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,520
and um that was a problem that hncp

1585
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,040
tried to solve and i think

1586
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,960
some degree did solve i don't think it's

1587
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,320
a perfect solution

1588
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,760
uh so one way to go forward with that

1589
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,520
would be to actually provide hncp and

1590
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,960
try to make it into something that's

1591
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,239
that's uh that's actually realistically

1592
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:41,280
deployable

1593
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,560
um but these are things that i think are

1594
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,719
topics that would be worth discussing

1595
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:49,280
next slide

1596
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:54,880
so um and and to get a little bit more

1597
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,440
into that

1598
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,600
um right now like if you i talked a

1599
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,199
little bit about the cd routers customer

1600
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,239
edge routers

1601
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,840
basically don't have any incentive tempo

1602
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,520
in hncp or any of the other home net

1603
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,239
stuff

1604
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,560
um because most of the time they're

1605
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,000
going to do all this work to get into

1606
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,800
the router

1607
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,840
and then you're going to plug the router

1608
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,040
into your network there are going to be

1609
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,080
no

1610
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,760
stub networks connected to it right

1611
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,159
there are going to be no

1612
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,159
other routers in the network and by the

1613
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,040
way if they made it really work well

1614
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,280
it would actually cut into their mesh um

1615
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,640
sales right

1616
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,760
so they actually have a bit of a

1617
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,840
disincentive plus mesh actually gives

1618
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,719
about a ux

1619
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,480
i talked about this a couple of well

1620
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,880
actually a lot of homemade meetings ago

1621
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,520
um that like you know if i and actually

1622
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:37,199
i had this experience the other day i

1623
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,560
was thinking about the talk i gave at

1624
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,600
ietf a while back um

1625
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,360
that uh you know i was on a voice call

1626
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,360
on a meeting i had my iphone in my

1627
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,520
pocket i was using my earbuds

1628
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,960
this was over ip and i needed to go do

1629
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,000
something in the garage

1630
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,840
and i right now i have mesh networking

1631
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,040
set up at my house

1632
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,719
so basically i was talking or i was

1633
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,320
listening to the to the meeting

1634
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:03,040
on my headphones walking walking walking

1635
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,320
out the door

1636
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,960
outside of the faraday cage the

1637
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,800
connection dropped for a minute

1638
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,480
but then it recovered and it was

1639
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,080
connected to my

1640
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,120
uh to the to the the mesh router in my

1641
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,159
garage

1642
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:19,920
so um so that's like a really nice ux

1643
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,000
and so there's a reason why router

1644
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,239
vendors didn't want to do the

1645
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,640
homenet subnetting model for that

1646
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,159
particular use case

1647
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,440
because if that had happened then

1648
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,520
um i would have had to hold entirely

1649
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,040
re-establish my connection it wouldn't

1650
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,040
have just been like oh i missed some tcp

1651
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,520
acts

1652
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,199
i need to wait to catch up with that and

1653
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:40,880
then everything will be back to normal

1654
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,159
it would have been i need to tear down

1655
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,920
the entire connection and re-establish

1656
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,120
the entire connection

1657
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,040
of course we talked about nptcp and

1658
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,480
other technologies for addressing these

1659
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,159
issues but the bottom line is

1660
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,120
right now the ux is way better on uh

1661
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,640
mesh than it would be

1662
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,840
with a subnetted home network so

1663
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,520
so that's not going to motivate router

1664
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,080
vendors to put this functionality in

1665
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,120
if however there were already devices in

1666
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,159
the home

1667
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:07,840
that could take advantage of this

1668
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,320
functionality then when a ce router

1669
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,000
vendor puts this into their router

1670
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,080
they have differentiation they can say

1671
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,440
your network is going to work better

1672
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,159
because you bought our router

1673
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,040
and so uh to me that seems like a better

1674
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,480
model for trying to get

1675
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,880
widespread implementation of this stuff

1676
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,320
than the model that we started with

1677
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:26,960
which was

1678
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,040
the router headers should do it and then

1679
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,800
everybody else will follow

1680
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,640
this way we're basically giving them an

1681
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,840
incentive to follow

1682
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,440
and we're not taking anything away from

1683
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,640
them because the use case that they're

1684
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,679
addressing right now

1685
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,080
is how do i get my iot devices to work

1686
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,800
better

1687
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,719
and you know by the way if i buy another

1688
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,040
router and plug it into the to the

1689
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,040
to the network you know it would be nice

1690
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,560
if if like i had bidirectional

1691
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,679
connectivity

1692
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,239
so anyway that's that's kind of my pitch

1693
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:53,920
for why this is a home net related

1694
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,360
topic next slide

1695
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,440
so the building blocks we have right now

1696
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,560
um

1697
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,320
and now we're back into the stuff that i

1698
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,920
presented earlier so if you were if you

1699
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:06,960
were in that presentation there's going

1700
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,400
to be a review here

1701
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,320
um we have a bunch of naming stuff um

1702
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,719
we have a way to register names we have

1703
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:16,400
a way to advertise those names using

1704
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,920
multicast dns

1705
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,880
we have a way to create a reliable uh

1706
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,320
named database using

1707
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,840
devices like i've been talking about

1708
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,000
stub network devices that are just like

1709
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,520
you know homepod mini i mean your

1710
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,880
homepod you don't think your homepod

1711
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,640
mini as a server right

1712
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,120
so it's perfectly fine to power cycle it

1713
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:37,920
or

1714
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,840
you know install a new software update

1715
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,600
on it there's nothing wrong with doing

1716
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,560
that it's not going to break your

1717
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,440
network

1718
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,920
however if it's got all of your srp

1719
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,120
registrations in it

1720
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,000
you're going to lose all those

1721
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,199
registrations and you're going to have

1722
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,600
to somehow regenerate them

1723
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,960
and because of the way that srp works

1724
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,719
with with conflict detection

1725
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,960
if you lose all of your information you

1726
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,760
could wind up

1727
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,600
getting surprising conflicts when you

1728
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,440
recover it's not a huge problem but it

1729
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,400
is a problem

1730
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,159
so being able to uh to have a stable

1731
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,880
store of name information service

1732
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,480
discovery information

1733
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,880
uh will create a better user experience

1734
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,960
and so that's the replication piece

1735
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:19,679
and then uh the ability to discover

1736
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,440
browsing zones so that you don't have to

1737
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,679
use multicast dns for every query

1738
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,520
if you you know normally like in a

1739
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,760
typical home network prior to

1740
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,360
sort of you know everybody getting light

1741
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,840
bulbs that had wi-fi in them

1742
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,440
uh there might be like five or ten

1743
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,040
services on your home network so there

1744
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,320
was a certain amount of multicast

1745
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,840
traffic but it wasn't like a huge amount

1746
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,280
of multicast traffic

1747
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,679
now we're talking about like a lot of a

1748
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,120
lot of devices advertising their

1749
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,159
services

1750
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,600
um and they're being advertised by the

1751
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,760
uh the srp advertising proxy

1752
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,440
and so um all of those answers are

1753
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,320
coming in

1754
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,800
in multicast packets and we're starting

1755
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,400
to get into situations where they might

1756
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,159
overflow and might wind up with a lot of

1757
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,040
packets

1758
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,239
and so is there a way to uh to

1759
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,360
to uh use

1760
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,080
uh is there is there a way to to get as

1761
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,440
much of that traffic into unicast

1762
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:14,880
traffic as possible

1763
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,239
so and then the fifth item on the on the

1764
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:18,640
uh

1765
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,800
on the agenda here is the actual stub

1766
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,640
networks document so this is this is the

1767
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:23,360
uh

1768
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,520
you know i i want to build a stub

1769
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,040
network i want to have a stub network

1770
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,320
what do i need to do to get the stub

1771
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,280
network working

1772
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,880
what do i need to do in terms of

1773
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,120
addressability reachability

1774
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,679
discoverability and so on so those are

1775
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:36,480
the topics

1776
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,559
um and

1777
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:48,239
so let's let's go on to the next slide

1778
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:51,280
so uh so i mentioned discovery browsing

1779
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,960
zones the deal here is that

1780
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,360
uh it'll be really nice to not have to

1781
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,960
do all of our service discovery with

1782
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,000
multicast

1783
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,159
and so the one way to do that is to add

1784
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,280
a level of indirection

1785
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,159
basically i would like to discover the

1786
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,239
server that i'm going to get my

1787
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,640
information from using multicast and

1788
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,000
then do

1789
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,760
all the rest of my discovery using

1790
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,480
unicast traffic

1791
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,520
and uh so the idea here

1792
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,120
is um that will advertise an ns record

1793
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,360
using multicast dns we'll advertise an a

1794
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,800
record or an a

1795
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,360
a quad a record or you know more than

1796
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,000
one

1797
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,480
that that answer the questions the ns

1798
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,360
record

1799
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,800
and that gets us to a dns server

1800
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,719
that we talked to using multicast oh

1801
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,560
sorry unicast

1802
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,440
so um and in order to avoid like

1803
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:42,480
spoofing

1804
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:45,120
we only allow home.arpa uh we might

1805
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,239
allow service.org

1806
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,159
as well that's an srp zone that would be

1807
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,320
registered when srp gets published

1808
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,520
um and uh

1809
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,320
so this is a this is you know a solution

1810
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,239
to the problem of

1811
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:00,080
of too much multicast traffic on your

1812
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,920
network i'll talk a little bit about the

1813
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,520
problems with that later

1814
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,080
um but because there are some issues

1815
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,040
that are actually

1816
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,800
kind of more home net specific than they

1817
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,239
are um

1818
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,719
dnssd specific about how to reduce

1819
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,400
multicast traffic

1820
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,239
um so we have a draft on this we haven't

1821
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,440
published it yet

1822
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,480
um you know drafted draft i should say

1823
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:21,120
it's not

1824
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,000
in an internet draft form yet um and

1825
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,040
that's going to be worked on

1826
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,040
dnssd but i mentioned it here because

1827
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,239
it's relevant to the

1828
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,600
you know it's something it's a service

1829
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,040
that you would expect to exist on a home

1830
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,560
run on a subrouter

1831
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,120
next slide

1832
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,560
okay similarly service registration

1833
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,640
protocol this is a unicast protocol for

1834
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,440
doing

1835
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,080
dns sd advertisements and again it's a

1836
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,920
service that needs to be available

1837
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,440
on a stub router in order for

1838
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,040
discoverability to work so if you want

1839
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,880
to be able to discover stuff

1840
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,239
on the sub network from the uh

1841
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,320
from the adjacent infrastructure network

1842
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,840
which would be typically your home

1843
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,120
wi-fi or your home ethernet um you need

1844
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,040
a way for the devices on a stub network

1845
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,400
to register

1846
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,400
their services with the stub router so

1847
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,560
the stub router can advertise them

1848
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,080
on the home link so uh so that's srp srp

1849
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,600
is a it's it's got this thing called

1850
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,040
first come first serve naming which

1851
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,560
allows you to claim a name

1852
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,000
using a cryptographically secure

1853
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,760
authentication mechanism

1854
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,760
um and um

1855
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,280
and then you get to keep that name until

1856
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,960
you until it expires

1857
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,159
um and so uh this is something that's

1858
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,440
already been implemented it's on the

1859
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,640
homepod mini

1860
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,760
there are a whole bunch of thread

1861
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,000
accessories that support it

1862
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,840
and that's something that's that's

1863
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,199
actually quite mature at this point and

1864
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,719
we expect we're hoping that the working

1865
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:41,600
group will

1866
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,080
go to last call soon but that's the dnsd

1867
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:44,800
working group so

1868
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,080
that's pretty sure next slide

1869
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,800
advertising proxy i talked about this

1870
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,480
earlier basically the idea is you have

1871
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,000
this database that you built up with

1872
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,320
srp now you need to make it available to

1873
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:57,679
devices that are on the adjacent

1874
01:19:57,679 --> 01:19:59,120
infrastructure network the advertising

1875
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,480
proxy is how you do that it just

1876
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,080
basically advertises everything that's

1877
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,960
in the

1878
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,560
database that's being maintained using

1879
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,239
srp using

1880
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:09,679
multicast dns um or using the ssd so

1881
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,000
the uh what i was talking about earlier

1882
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,280
with discovering

1883
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,320
multi with discovering dns ssd zones uh

1884
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,159
using multicast dns

1885
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:19,920
now we're discovering the advertising

1886
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,080
proxy using multicast dns but then all

1887
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,440
of the rest of the queries

1888
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,760
that we do to the advertising proxy go

1889
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,560
over

1890
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,480
unicast and so that saves a whole bunch

1891
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,840
of multicast traffic

1892
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,960
so that's another thing that's it's it's

1893
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,199
we've got several implementations of

1894
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:36,480
that um

1895
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,400
and it's in pretty good shape but we

1896
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,920
still have work to do in the dssd

1897
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:40,480
working group

1898
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:41,440
this is something that's going to be

1899
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,239
part of the stub router specification

1900
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,839
next slide

1901
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,840
srp replication i mentioned this earlier

1902
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,440
you need to be able to have

1903
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,440
a stable database or you'd like to be

1904
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,120
able to have a stable database of srp

1905
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,000
clients

1906
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,679
and not lose them when there's a reboot

1907
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,280
so that's srv replication

1908
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,360
addresses that issue i won't go into

1909
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,120
great detail about srp replication here

1910
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:04,400
unless somebody wants to ask more

1911
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,280
questions

1912
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,840
next slide

1913
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,440
okay so now the stub networks document

1914
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,639
so this is the document that's actually

1915
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:12,960
the

1916
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,199
the the core work that i wanted to talk

1917
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,639
about for home net

1918
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:18,880
um there are actually two documents one

1919
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,560
of them is a problem statement basically

1920
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,280
says

1921
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,639
here's the problem we're trying to solve

1922
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:23,679
and here are some ideas that we've

1923
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:24,480
considered

1924
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,760
for how to solve it um and i don't know

1925
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,360
if that document needs to become

1926
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,679
a working group document i think it's

1927
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:33,360
useful information

1928
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,840
uh michael had the idea of actually just

1929
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,199
taking that information and putting it

1930
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,960
into appendices

1931
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,800
in the uh the implementation document so

1932
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,080
that's another way to go the

1933
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:46,000
implementation document currently draft

1934
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,199
lemon stub networks

1935
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,520
uh describes how to connect stub

1936
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,600
networks to existing infrastructure

1937
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,840
and

1938
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,400
that document is based on the work that

1939
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,760
we did on

1940
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,880
the homepod mini and on open thread um

1941
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,199
and it's uh

1942
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,199
it's a pretty good document it's it

1943
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,639
still needs some work it needs like it

1944
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:09,920
would be nice to talk about people have

1945
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,679
asked about a state machine for

1946
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:13,360
for how things are managed i'll talk a

1947
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,719
little bit about what's in the document

1948
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,159
after i've sort of gone over my field

1949
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:17,360
about maturity

1950
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,120
um so uh

1951
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,199
it's not ready to implement i i think is

1952
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,480
work that would be interesting to do in

1953
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,040
homenet

1954
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,840
and so so my goal is to uh to see at

1955
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,360
home that is interested in adopting it

1956
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,159
and working on it

1957
01:22:30,159 --> 01:22:31,760
and you know the big question mark is

1958
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:33,120
are there people here who are actually

1959
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,800
interested in doing this work and is

1960
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,000
this a place where they would be willing

1961
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,880
to do it

1962
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,960
it feels a little funny to do this work

1963
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,280
in iot ops because i really don't think

1964
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,040
this is iot specific i actually think

1965
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,159
this is very

1966
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,239
core to the work that that home net was

1967
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,360
trying to do

1968
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,679
and so i i'd like to see it done here if

1969
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:51,040
it's possible

1970
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,960
another place could be done is v6 ops

1971
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,080
the current document is

1972
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,120
is claiming to be a bcp

1973
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,520
you know obviously if it gets published

1974
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,400
um

1975
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,239
and so that would be something that

1976
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:03,920
could be done in v6 ops the problem is

1977
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,480
v6 ops that would be very unfocused

1978
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,719
whereas this use case is very specific

1979
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,080
to home networks so really the question

1980
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,040
is is there

1981
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,480
is there interest i mean i think the

1982
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,679
question is is they're interested in

1983
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:14,880
working on this in the

1984
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,480
networking group so i'll talk a little

1985
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:19,040
bit about what uh i know let me see

1986
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,320
i'm gonna look at my own copy of the

1987
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,440
slides um

1988
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,080
so yeah so let me just talk a little bit

1989
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,360
about what the stub networks

1990
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,560
uh document describes so um

1991
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:33,520
basically the idea is you connect a stub

1992
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,120
network a stub router

1993
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,360
to the adjacent infrastructure network

1994
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,960
the stub router looks on the

1995
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,960
network to see if there's ipv6 service

1996
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,719
so one thing to say about this is that

1997
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:43,840
currently

1998
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,120
there isn't an easy way to do

1999
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,679
bi-directional permissionless

2000
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,360
ipv4 um but it's actually pretty easy to

2001
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,440
do bi-directional permissionless ipv6

2002
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,320
and so we just

2003
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,920
said that's what we're doing we're not

2004
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,239
doing ipv4

2005
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:01,440
for bi-directional connectivity you know

2006
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,560
it would be no problem to have a an ipv4

2007
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:04,880
net

2008
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,400
behind another ipv before that and

2009
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,840
devices on the stub network could

2010
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,280
connect out to devices that are on the

2011
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,159
home network

2012
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,639
or out to the cloud but we didn't really

2013
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,239
want that answer because that doesn't

2014
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,520
give us the ability

2015
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,360
to operate devices on the stub network

2016
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,360
from the home network so hence ipv6 only

2017
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,239
all right so how do we make that work uh

2018
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,040
stub network

2019
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,360
router the stub router looks on the home

2020
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,320
network and

2021
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,679
checks to see if there is um ipv6

2022
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:35,120
service already available on the home

2023
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,120
network um that would be a router

2024
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,040
advertisement that contains

2025
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,199
a

2026
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,679
a prefix information option that is

2027
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,880
on link and is uh eligible for auto

2028
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:49,840
configuration

2029
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,120
or has dhcp v6 support those are the two

2030
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,159
options

2031
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:57,760
um sorry i've been talking a long time i

2032
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,719
thought it's getting dry i should have

2033
01:24:58,719 --> 01:24:59,920
brought some water

2034
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,520
so um

2035
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:06,480
so so is there ipv6 addressing already

2036
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,880
available on the home network if not

2037
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,199
then the home router will advertise the

2038
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:12,159
prefix

2039
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:14,560
um and it this is this would be a little

2040
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,159
dangerous right because

2041
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:18,639
what if ipv6 service comes back we don't

2042
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:19,199
want to

2043
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:20,480
steal the default route from the

2044
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,080
customer edge router that would be

2045
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,040
really bad

2046
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,719
so the way we advertise this is using um

2047
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,120
using an ra with the default with the

2048
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:31,280
router's default lifetime

2049
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,840
sorry the router lifetime set to zero so

2050
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:34,320
that means

2051
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,480
don't use this as a default router and

2052
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,080
so devices that support

2053
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:41,040
that functionality will ignore the ra in

2054
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,560
terms of setting up their default route

2055
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:43,360
and in fact this

2056
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,120
this is you know we haven't had any

2057
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,320
issues with devices that don't

2058
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,360
understand this that

2059
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,960
the issue that we have seen is that

2060
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,560
there are some devices that

2061
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,520
when they see a router lifetime of zero

2062
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,199
they just ignore the ra

2063
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:57,280
um but that's less of a problem now than

2064
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,639
it was two years ago

2065
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,199
uh through efforts that we've undertaken

2066
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:01,920
so

2067
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,600
um so that's that's how we get

2068
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,639
ipv6 addresses onto the home network um

2069
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,560
and we can do roughly the same thing

2070
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,719
for the stub network um for thread it

2071
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:13,920
turns out that there's a different way

2072
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,199
of configuring prefixes

2073
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,440
we don't use r8 but but basically the

2074
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,040
principle is the same you advertise the

2075
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,199
prefix on this on the stub network

2076
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,000
and uh you know and by the way the

2077
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,080
prefix is being advertised here

2078
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:28,320
in sort of the normal case is just a ula

2079
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,080
the home the router creates a ula and

2080
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,600
advertises it on the home network and on

2081
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,880
the stub network different

2082
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,360
different slash 64s out of that slash 48

2083
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,719
ula

2084
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,120
and now we have ipv6 addressing on both

2085
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:39,920
sides

2086
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,840
so that means that the nodes that are on

2087
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,159
the home network have ipv6 addresses

2088
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,600
nodes that are on the stub network have

2089
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,280
ipv6 addresses and so

2090
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,040
therefore in principle they could talk

2091
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,239
to each other because they have

2092
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:51,520
addresses

2093
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,159
the next step is how do we tell devices

2094
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,600
on the home network they can reach

2095
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,440
devices on the stub network and that's

2096
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,360
by again doing an ra

2097
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,520
with the route information option so ras

2098
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,360
have this is something was added after

2099
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,760
the original ra document

2100
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,719
that provides the ability to advertise

2101
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:10,320
specific routes

2102
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,199
in the ra and so we just advertise a

2103
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:14,800
specific route to the prefix that's on

2104
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:15,760
the sub network

2105
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:19,440
and we're done now now a host that's on

2106
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,120
the home network can send packets to the

2107
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,760
stub network

2108
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,360
so then the next step is

2109
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,920
that the devices on the stub network

2110
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,360
need to be able to send packets to the

2111
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,000
home network

2112
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,840
and that's actually sort of easy i mean

2113
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,840
one way to do that is to just have

2114
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,520
any stub router advertise a default

2115
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,679
route that works great except what if

2116
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:41,199
you have two stub routers that are

2117
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:42,480
connected to

2118
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,120
different adjacent infrastructure links

2119
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:46,639
but are connected to the same stub

2120
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,239
network link

2121
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,320
then you have a problem because if both

2122
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,719
of them are advertising default route

2123
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:53,600
then you're only going to have

2124
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,600
reachability to whichever one is closest

2125
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,880
to the accessory

2126
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,120
reachability to the adjacent network of

2127
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,000
the stub router that's

2128
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,520
closest to whichever accessory is trying

2129
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,040
to talk to that device

2130
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,400
so it's if we want to support that use

2131
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,760
case and i think we do

2132
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,760
then we actually need to advertise

2133
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,199
essentially the same thing on this on

2134
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,800
the stub network side we need to

2135
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,719
you know if the stub network is a wi-fi

2136
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,000
network then we would advertise

2137
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,159
route information options with specific

2138
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,760
routes to the adjacent infrastructure

2139
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,560
links

2140
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:23,760
um if it's a

2141
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,719
if it's a thread network uh then we're

2142
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:30,159
not using ras but basically the same

2143
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:31,360
principle applies

2144
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,520
so so that's basically the idea of how

2145
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,719
routing works

2146
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,679
um so this is not like a routing

2147
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,120
protocol we're just using router

2148
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,239
advertisements because we're just

2149
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,440
talking to adjacent links we're not

2150
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,639
doing anything fancy

2151
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,000
it would be nice to enhance this with

2152
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,239
people um but but

2153
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:52,080
you know this basically works so um

2154
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:56,320
the next step is uh let's see

2155
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,960
uh oh right so so i talked earlier about

2156
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:01,040
dnssd so all of that functionality is

2157
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,159
required

2158
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:05,520
in order to um provide discoverability

2159
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,400
of devices

2160
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,280
on the stub network from the adjacent

2161
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,239
network

2162
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:11,920
um one thing i didn't mention in the

2163
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,760
slides

2164
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,080
is that stub network devices also may

2165
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,679
need to discover devices that are on the

2166
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:18,880
adjacent network

2167
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,800
and the so in the adjacent network being

2168
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,400
a wi-fi network you know it's your home

2169
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,760
now usually right so

2170
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,960
so those devices are going to be

2171
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:27,440
advertising using multicast dns

2172
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,960
um and that means that we need a dns sd

2173
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,000
discovery proxy as well in the sr sr

2174
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,400
in the stub network router and by the

2175
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,600
way all of the stuff that i'm talking

2176
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,800
about is already in stub network

2177
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,400
documents so if you're totally lost and

2178
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:40,960
you

2179
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,440
you know you can read the document and i

2180
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,639
think it's pretty clear

2181
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,520
um but anyway the uh in order for

2182
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,880
devices that are on the stub network to

2183
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,639
discover devices in the home network

2184
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:52,960
they need to be able to send dns queries

2185
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:53,679
to

2186
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,960
the discovery proxy which can then

2187
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,239
send dns's d queries out on the home

2188
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,080
network to get back the answers that

2189
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:02,800
that are

2190
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,920
returned to the to the sr to the to the

2191
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,679
just to the dnssd

2192
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,800
client on the stub network so so that's

2193
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:12,159
an additional piece of functionality

2194
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:12,480
that

2195
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,920
the reason i don't mention that in these

2196
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,520
slides is because that work is completed

2197
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,840
we already have dns push we already have

2198
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,239
the discovery proxy those are both rfcs

2199
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,040
so

2200
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,639
so there's no further work to do on that

2201
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:23,679
it's just something that needs to go

2202
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,440
into a stub network router

2203
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,400
so can we go to the next slide now i'm

2204
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:29,920
almost done honest

2205
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:33,199
um so

2206
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:34,560
one of the issues that we have and i

2207
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,480
alluded to this earlier is that

2208
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,960
um we need to be able to do if we want

2209
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:40,639
to be able to do full mesh routing we

2210
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,080
have to have prefixes that are

2211
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,320
that are valid on the network so like

2212
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,400
this the subrouter can generate a prefix

2213
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,760
a ula prefix

2214
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,120
and use that on a link that it's

2215
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,360
directly connected to and that works

2216
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:54,639
right but if we want routing to links

2217
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,239
that the stub router is not directly

2218
01:30:56,239 --> 01:30:57,199
connected to

2219
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:00,000
we have to have a real ipv6 address it

2220
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,560
doesn't have to be a gua it could be a

2221
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,639
ula but the ula has to come from this

2222
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:06,159
from the infrastructure

2223
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:07,520
not from the sub router so the

2224
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,800
infrastructure knows how to route the

2225
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,480
ula if it is ula

2226
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:12,239
if it's a gui that's great too it just

2227
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,000
needs to be able to route that

2228
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,800
so um so we need a solution for pbx

2229
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:17,440
delegation

2230
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,800
right now we don't have one um dhcp v6

2231
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,440
sort of gives us what we want hncp sort

2232
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:24,960
of gives us what we want the problem is

2233
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,800
hncp is doing a bunch of stuff we really

2234
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,239
don't want for stub networks we don't

2235
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:29,280
want the

2236
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,960
we don't want hmcp to be blasting out

2237
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,560
multicast packets on the sub network

2238
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,920
that's a really bad idea it's never

2239
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,360
going to reach anything

2240
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,560
um so so we would need to to have a

2241
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,679
profile for hmcp if we used hncp

2242
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:43,600
and similarly we would need extensions

2243
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,120
to dhcp v6 if we use dhcp v6

2244
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,719
these are open questions but also if we

2245
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:51,120
use dhcp v6 we need some way

2246
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,760
to cooperate we because there might be

2247
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,360
multiple sub routers that all need the

2248
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,679
same prefix for the same stub network

2249
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,280
how do they all know about it how does

2250
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,719
that get into the routing infrastructure

2251
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:02,480
that's an interesting problem

2252
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,480
um an unsolved problem so this is

2253
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,040
something we could work on

2254
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,320
um another problem is uh suppose we've

2255
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:12,480
got a ce router that supports

2256
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:15,760
uh dns ssd supports

2257
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,280
uh you know supports

2258
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:21,440
delegating browsing zones how do we how

2259
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:22,960
do we actually tell it what browsing

2260
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,320
zones to delegate

2261
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,320
um you know there's two there's two

2262
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,600
solutions here actually one is we can

2263
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,760
just put an srp server in the stub

2264
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:32,080
sorry in the ce router and then the stub

2265
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:33,440
network

2266
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,840
devices could discover the srp server

2267
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,440
that's in the stub router

2268
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,000
and then they could just forward srp

2269
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,360
requests straight to the stub router and

2270
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,040
now those devices are all discoverable

2271
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:43,840
using

2272
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,639
using dnssd without any multicast

2273
01:32:46,639 --> 01:32:48,080
traffic at all

2274
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,679
that's one way to solve the problem

2275
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,120
another way to solve the problem

2276
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:54,719
is to have the keep the the

2277
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:58,080
srp server and the uh dns

2278
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,120
zone in the stub routers but

2279
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:03,920
have a delegation from the ce router so

2280
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:05,600
either way we solve that problem there's

2281
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,000
new text to write

2282
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,320
and it's probably text that needs to get

2283
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:11,360
written in

2284
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:14,000
home net or some equivalent working

2285
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:14,639
group

2286
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:16,639
i think i suppose it could be done in

2287
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:18,320
the ssd also but it seems home net

2288
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,040
relevant because

2289
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,320
we're talking about customer edge

2290
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,560
routers in a multi-subnet at home and

2291
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,480
that seems like home network

2292
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,000
um so uh and then

2293
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,760
how do we eliminate all this excess

2294
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,280
multicast dns traffic because we're

2295
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,320
starting to like if we're going to

2296
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,760
really leverage all of the service

2297
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,040
discovery stuff we're going to start to

2298
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,480
see more traffic

2299
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,400
multicast traffic is already a problem

2300
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,920
it slows the network down

2301
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:43,199
it's not reliable um and so

2302
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:44,960
you know one way to do that is to just

2303
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,239
like

2304
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:47,920
have the stub router intercept all the

2305
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:49,760
multicast sorry have this the customer

2306
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,000
edge

2307
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,520
router have the wi-fi access point

2308
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,840
intercept all the multicast traffic

2309
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,120
so when you've got a multicast uh dssd

2310
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,000
multicast

2311
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,199
sorry an mds multicast from a client

2312
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:04,400
on the wi-fi network it's just consumed

2313
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:04,960
by the

2314
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,520
by the access point which then forwards

2315
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,199
it to a discovery proxy

2316
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,120
which sends back the answer if we need

2317
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:13,199
to discover devices we can use

2318
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,679
dns we can use mdns but it's not really

2319
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,520
multicast we're just sending mdns to

2320
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,719
each host

2321
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,719
um and then if that host has one of the

2322
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:22,560
services it will reply with the unicast

2323
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:23,360
reply

2324
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,120
which it thinks is a multicast reply but

2325
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,040
we're intercepting the multicast

2326
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,679
so we can basically eliminate all of

2327
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:31,280
that multicast traffic from being

2328
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,440
actually transmitted as wi-fi multicast

2329
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,320
traffic

2330
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:38,239
um this again seems like something that

2331
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:40,719
would make sense to discuss in homeland

2332
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:41,440
um

2333
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:44,000
so those are other topics that i think

2334
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,239
would be worth working on in the future

2335
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:50,159
um and uh

2336
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:51,760
that's that's pretty much what i have to

2337
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,199
talk about we go to the next slide that

2338
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:55,840
has that has the list of drafts

2339
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,600
and you can talk to me about this and

2340
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:59,040
you can talk to stuart about this

2341
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:00,560
and there are actually there are a bunch

2342
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,159
of people in open thread that you can

2343
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,600
also talk to about this but

2344
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,360
but stuart and i are kind of the main

2345
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:07,040
co-conspirators so

2346
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:10,239
so talking to us would be good

2347
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,719
thank you ted um

2348
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,440
that was actually really cool okay so

2349
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,880
first i'd like to

2350
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,520
open up the queue for technical

2351
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:24,960
discussion

2352
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,159
on um all of this uh

2353
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:31,040
stub network topic i have seen a little

2354
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,080
chatter in the

2355
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:35,040
chat um would anyone have additional

2356
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,080
questions or comments

2357
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,520
i noticed that oola asked the question

2358
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,600
about what i mean by full mesh routing

2359
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:45,840
is do i just mean routing the reason i'm

2360
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,119
drawing that distinction

2361
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:50,080
is because um we're sort of doing riding

2362
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:51,840
with ras which is not really a

2363
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:54,880
routing protocol so uh so i say full

2364
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,800
mesh routing just to distinguish between

2365
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,639
like you know sort of routing with ras

2366
01:35:58,639 --> 01:35:59,119
versus

2367
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:03,040
actual routing so yes i do mean

2368
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:07,679
stuart yeah the thing i would add to

2369
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:08,320
that

2370
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:13,199
is the distinction

2371
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,239
uh when when ted and i talk about full

2372
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,360
mesh routing

2373
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,679
we mean multiple hops within the home

2374
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:20,639
network

2375
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,239
and what ted is talking about here with

2376
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:23,679
the stub networks

2377
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:26,800
is a simplified form of that where you

2378
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,920
assume

2379
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,239
that the home has one current wi-fi

2380
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,280
network which is

2381
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,679
in a sense the backbone network and you

2382
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,760
may have multiple stubs hanging off that

2383
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,880
backbone

2384
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,960
but it's not an arbitrary topology of

2385
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,239
interconnected links

2386
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,320
it is a backbone with some number of

2387
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:44,320
stubs hanging off it

2388
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,159
and part of the complexity ted's talk

2389
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,800
mode is some of those stub routers

2390
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,280
might serve the same stub network so

2391
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,040
that's where some coordination is needed

2392
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,159
because you want multiple

2393
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:56,960
stub routers for reliability but you

2394
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,400
don't want them to step on each other's

2395
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,040
toes

2396
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,040
so this is intentionally a

2397
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,360
simplification of the problem statement

2398
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,199
to not try to do a full multi-hop

2399
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:06,800
network in the home

2400
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,440
but to have a two-tier hierarchy with

2401
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,440
the backbone and stubs hanging off it

2402
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,199
but not stubs hanging off stubs

2403
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,080
and infinite

2404
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,480
okay is there further technical

2405
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:23,600
discussion

2406
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,639
um if not we'll launch

2407
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,880
into the administrative discussion

2408
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:35,840
of oh eric

2409
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:40,159
yeah so that first without any hat at

2410
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:40,800
all

2411
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:42,880
uh looks like the cool stuff honestly i

2412
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:44,239
didn't read i didn't

2413
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,400
write uh your slides uh that's one thing

2414
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:48,239
i will do over the weekend for sure

2415
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:51,520
uh look there's simple ids now

2416
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:54,080
putting back my ad hat just curious

2417
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,480
about the intended status

2418
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,560
do you think it could be more like a

2419
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:00,719
best command practice

2420
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:03,040
for these document like so you don't

2421
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,800
produce any protocol right that's my

2422
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:05,760
understanding

2423
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,679
so it's only advise and bcp

2424
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:11,600
yeah it's it's really on the edge

2425
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,960
because uh

2426
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,600
for for you know one of the things we

2427
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,360
want is to avoid having the stub

2428
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,679
router step on the home network right we

2429
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:21,360
don't want the stub router to be

2430
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,880
adding a bunch of stuff to the home

2431
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,800
network that isn't needed and in order

2432
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,320
to avoid doing that we need a state

2433
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,679
machine to track what's happening on the

2434
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:29,440
home network so in a sense

2435
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:30,960
that state machine looks an awful lot

2436
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,719
like a piece of protocol work

2437
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,080
but um but yeah

2438
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,400
this is really more in the line of best

2439
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,760
this this particular

2440
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:41,760
the the stub networks document in

2441
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,880
particular i think

2442
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,719
you know the reason i call it bcp right

2443
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,159
now and why i think that's maybe the

2444
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,840
right name for it is because

2445
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,600
really it's mostly here's what you do

2446
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,360
with ras which we already have a

2447
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,639
protocol spec for

2448
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:54,800
you know here's what you do with uh

2449
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:55,840
dnssd

2450
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,440
we already have these protocol specs or

2451
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,440
we're working on these protocol specs so

2452
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:03,119
um so in that sense uh

2453
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:04,480
you know it does make sense to call it a

2454
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,920
bcp and i think that that's a question

2455
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,199
that we should answer

2456
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:10,159
um it may be that that the right way to

2457
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:12,159
do this is to have a bcp

2458
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:13,920
and then actually have a little document

2459
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,199
that just talks about the state machine

2460
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:15,600
that's

2461
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,960
that's a that's a standard document

2462
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,119
okay so going back

2463
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,119
i was just going to say you know as

2464
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:27,679
someone who is involved in all of the ce

2465
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,560
router documents um actually what i was

2466
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,560
thinking was that what you're describing

2467
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:36,000
sounds rather like a device profile

2468
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,520
type document which has often been uh

2469
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,119
published as informational

2470
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:48,239
then we can't say mustard should

2471
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:50,480
oh no oh no we have no problems with

2472
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,119
mustang sheds and informational

2473
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:54,880
those can be all over the place in

2474
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,239
informational drafts

2475
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:58,719
trust me it's not to my taste personally

2476
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:00,400
but okay

2477
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,159
again no on this one no head at all

2478
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,199
now other questions the open

2479
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,400
threading group open thread group does

2480
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,199
it produce

2481
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:15,040
specification no no the goal is to have

2482
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,280
this be a specification the ietf and by

2483
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,560
the way i mean one thing that i would

2484
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,080
like to emphasize is that although this

2485
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,440
is shipping and products

2486
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:23,760
because it's sort of just advice about

2487
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,960
how to do stuff

2488
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,719
if we change the advice a little bit i

2489
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:28,000
don't think it would have i don't think

2490
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,199
that would be a bad outcome like we're

2491
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:29,600
not

2492
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,280
wedded to doing it exactly the way we're

2493
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:32,639
currently doing it so

2494
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:34,560
so this is not like please please rubber

2495
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,320
stamp this on iatf this is let's work on

2496
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,920
this let's look at this let's critique

2497
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:38,480
it

2498
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:41,119
let's change it if we need to okay that

2499
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:41,920
was basically

2500
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,480
my next point and my last command is way

2501
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,159
too early to to decide of course

2502
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,760
for sure it's not for iot ops uh i'm not

2503
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,159
sure though it's in home net

2504
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,320
we need to check the charter based on

2505
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:57,840
the content of course we can start

2506
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,199
working here right so

2507
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:01,040
like every community in the ietf that's

2508
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,239
for sure

2509
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,880
um omnet was very specific a sling

2510
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,520
somehow

2511
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,040
in the mindset of many people to hncp

2512
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,440
and maybe it could be wise and again

2513
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,639
it's way too early

2514
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:14,239
and maybe i'm removing my head on this

2515
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,320
one

2516
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,719
it's way too early to link this to hncp

2517
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:20,560
maybe another group

2518
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,840
and dissociate hncp uh from your ids

2519
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,480
could be better on the long term again a

2520
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:26,960
little bit

2521
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,960
early right but just put the question in

2522
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,080
your mind

2523
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,920
i mean i will say that i think this

2524
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,760
document is ready for adoption in some

2525
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:34,880
working group

2526
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,040
so in that sense perhaps it's not quite

2527
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,880
as early as you're suggesting

2528
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,679
but uh yeah i agree that if we think

2529
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:43,679
home that is really all about hncp

2530
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,840
then it probably isn't the right place

2531
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:48,400
that's an open question to me i mean

2532
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,719
for me is about the multi-subnet routing

2533
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,239
problem but it really depends on who's

2534
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,239
showing up right

2535
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:56,159
yeah but maybe your document is ready

2536
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,360
right so it's not about

2537
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,400
the quality but again

2538
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,000
i'm not sure whether it's good tidy to

2539
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,960
link both together

2540
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:07,920
i mean you said it right somehow it's

2541
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:10,719
disappointing but hncp is not deployed

2542
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:13,360
yeah i mean i think i think you know one

2543
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,800
suggestion that i would have is that

2544
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,159
this is something we could discuss on

2545
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:17,520
the working group mailing list and if it

2546
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,600
basically just falls flat

2547
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,560
then it's probably not a good idea right

2548
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,920
we probably shouldn't do it at home

2549
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,159
nobody answers questions about it nobody

2550
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:27,600
wants to talk about it

2551
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,840
we shouldn't do it at home yet but you

2552
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:31,280
know if there's interest in doing the

2553
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,080
work

2554
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,520
i mean i think that you know there are

2555
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,360
some experts who are not normally

2556
01:42:35,360 --> 01:42:37,360
attendees at home that who would

2557
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,760
hopefully show up if we did it at home

2558
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,400
that

2559
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,480
if we did it in v6 ops maybe those

2560
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,920
experts would already be there but the

2561
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,520
problem is if we do it in v6 ops then we

2562
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,159
just have like

2563
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,159
it's it's just it's the anything working

2564
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:50,080
group you know this isn't this isn't

2565
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:50,400
really

2566
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,040
anything smart i won't comment on this

2567
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:53,520
right but

2568
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,440
routing looking group for instance

2569
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,800
voting area working group would be also

2570
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,679
an interesting part

2571
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:03,119
hey thank you

2572
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,280
uh this is stuart i want to add

2573
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,119
something uh eric

2574
01:43:07,119 --> 01:43:08,639
you asked a question and i want to make

2575
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:11,199
sure we give you an accurate answer

2576
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:12,880
you said does the thread group produce

2577
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:15,040
specifications and the answer is yes it

2578
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,880
does

2579
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,520
for things that are specific to thread

2580
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,840
and

2581
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,800
one possibility is we could do this work

2582
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,600
just within the context of thread

2583
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:29,119
but the reason we think that's a bad

2584
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:30,719
idea is because

2585
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,800
it's applicable to many different kinds

2586
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:34,400
of networks not just threat

2587
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,920
so we don't want it to be pigeonholed

2588
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:39,840
want to work with the ietf to find the

2589
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,440
right ways to solve this

2590
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,760
and thread will be a beneficiary of that

2591
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:46,960
but not the only one

2592
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,560
and basically when i was asking the

2593
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,159
question it was basically

2594
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,280
whether we will receive the

2595
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,880
specification from thread and you put

2596
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,320
the itf stem on it

2597
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,880
so it's not the case and i do agree it

2598
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:57,520
goes

2599
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,000
it seems to go at least to be something

2600
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,119
much wider

2601
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:04,960
than playing thread so yeah

2602
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,360
this is exactly why ted and i have

2603
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,639
encouraged

2604
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:11,280
uh people currently engaged with thread

2605
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:12,960
we've encouraged those people

2606
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:15,920
to understand how the ietf works and get

2607
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,679
involved because we think the ietf

2608
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:21,840
is the right venue for this work

2609
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:25,920
by the way just a slight clarification

2610
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:26,320
um

2611
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:29,520
eric asked about open thread and stuart

2612
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,199
you answered about the thread group and

2613
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,960
they're actually two different things

2614
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,280
but you know that's that's a good point

2615
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,800
there is there is an organization that

2616
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,560
does specs for thread that's the thread

2617
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:40,800
group

2618
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,320
stephen

2619
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:47,360
yeah so i mean i think this is pretty

2620
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,199
cool stuff uh i i would like to see it

2621
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:50,639
happen in the itf somewhere

2622
01:44:50,639 --> 01:44:52,960
and home it might be in that place i

2623
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:53,840
don't know i don't

2624
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,639
it's not a huge deal it is or isn't but

2625
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,400
i guess the question i have is how many

2626
01:44:58,400 --> 01:44:59,920
other people are interested in working

2627
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,040
on this that's the one i'd love to get

2628
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,159
an answer to which you might not get

2629
01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:02,719
today

2630
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,760
for sure raising the list of course

2631
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,440
but i'd really love to know from this

2632
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,040
from the you know there's 40 people in

2633
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:10,560
the session

2634
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,719
how many people if there are people here

2635
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:14,880
who are interested in this work or

2636
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,360
helping with it seeing it happen you

2637
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,880
know those expressions of interest now

2638
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,159
could be quite useful in terms of

2639
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:22,239
figuring out what to do

2640
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:25,920
i'll uh put together a poll on that

2641
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,159
um i thought we had another in the queue

2642
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:34,000
um but esco was in the queue

2643
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,199
yeah did you want to okay um while he

2644
01:45:37,199 --> 01:45:38,239
talks i'm going

2645
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:40,719
to um put a poll together and we'll see

2646
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:43,440
what sort of interest we have

2647
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,440
yeah i think what i wanted to say was

2648
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,520
just the clarification indeed uh like

2649
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,320
open threads that's the open source

2650
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,600
software project

2651
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,239
it does not make any specifications

2652
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:56,239
there's a thread group who it doesn't

2653
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:56,639
make

2654
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:58,800
the open source source software but does

2655
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,960
make specifications but they're

2656
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:05,199
mostly based on itf specifications

2657
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:09,679
so that's the clarification

2658
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,880
one thing to say about um asking that

2659
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:13,760
question is

2660
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:16,480
i was planning on getting the open

2661
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:17,360
thread people

2662
01:46:17,360 --> 01:46:20,320
sorry the thread group people to uh to

2663
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,760
come and participate

2664
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,080
in this meeting but i just didn't have

2665
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,520
time this week to arrange that

2666
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:28,880
so um i really one of my goals here is

2667
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:29,679
actually to get

2668
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:31,360
because we this working group has been a

2669
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,800
little bit more open

2670
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,040
and that's been a little bit sad to me

2671
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,639
because um

2672
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,000
i think the work we're doing in this

2673
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,360
working group is really interesting

2674
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,239
useful work

2675
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:42,800
and i feel like we didn't quite make it

2676
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:44,320
and that's frustrating

2677
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:45,679
so i really want to see this working

2678
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,199
group succeed at what it originally set

2679
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:48,320
out to do

2680
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,960
and so one of my you know sort of sort

2681
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,199
of evil plans is to get more people

2682
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,880
involved by pulling thread group people

2683
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,639
in to help work on this stuff

2684
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:58,000
because i think it's an area of interest

2685
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,199
to a lot of those folks as well

2686
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,239
barbara i'm not sure if that uh poll

2687
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:12,559
worked

2688
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,440
no i'm uh redoing it because i found it

2689
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,159
was ambiguous the way i put it together

2690
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:23,839
i got it good

2691
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:37,840
okay i think this is less ambiguous

2692
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,600
and so if anybody um hasn't used the

2693
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,480
poll tool you should be able to go up to

2694
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,000
the little icon

2695
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,960
at the top that looks like a vertical

2696
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,760
bar graph

2697
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:53,119
and click on that and um vote on one of

2698
01:47:53,119 --> 01:47:55,839
the options

2699
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,280
if people clicking buttons are

2700
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:05,920
comfortable to also speak on the topic

2701
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,880
that would be welcome to

2702
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:20,960
okay um so it looks like uh

2703
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,760
out of the 35 participants on the call

2704
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:24,560
today

2705
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,000
11 have raised their hand and one has

2706
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:32,400
purposefully not raised their hand

2707
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:36,400
which is a no i'm not interested um

2708
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,520
and i guess that means the remaining 23

2709
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:44,000
are disinterested

2710
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,840
um

2711
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:51,600
there is always that possibility um

2712
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:55,760
okay so

2713
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,040
let's sort of then talk about

2714
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,800
um not just this but also daniel

2715
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,480
and michael's work on the

2716
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:10,080
name delegation and how to

2717
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,520
best get good

2718
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,800
um review of that topic

2719
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,920
so maybe

2720
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,360
let me do another just a clarification

2721
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:24,480
um

2722
01:49:24,480 --> 01:49:28,080
um me and michael i mean they are um

2723
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:31,199
andre thanks father what's going on but

2724
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:34,080
i'd prefer not to

2725
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,360
fair enough um y'all are simply the lead

2726
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:37,920
authors

2727
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,880
that's why i name you um and rey is also

2728
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,960
i think one of the authors now that's

2729
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,320
listed

2730
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,840
um but yeah so let i'm going to

2731
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,360
just do a poll of uh

2732
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:55,599
if we were to do a wglc

2733
01:49:55,599 --> 01:50:11,840
how many people would review

2734
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:52,480
that is a pretty good um review it's not

2735
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,560
bad to get nine raised hands on that

2736
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,040
sort of thing

2737
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:59,280
um

2738
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:05,360
does it make sense steven and eric then

2739
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,119
for us to just go ahead

2740
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:10,239
and proceed with the wglc

2741
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,239
if uh this many people are willing to

2742
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:14,800
review it here

2743
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,920
for me yes it's enough specifically in a

2744
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:19,280
small working group

2745
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,840
and now you may want as well to ask the

2746
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:22,400
review

2747
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,800
by the internet directorate to get some

2748
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:27,679
dns expertise

2749
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,239
yes i think it's if we got nine or

2750
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:34,560
nine decent reviews it would be great if

2751
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,159
nine people are willing today

2752
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:38,000
we may get less than nine it's possible

2753
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,599
but i think it's it's worth a shot

2754
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:43,360
um so yeah when

2755
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,840
when daniel and michael think it's ready

2756
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:47,040
then yeah we could do

2757
01:51:47,040 --> 01:51:48,400
we could give it a try and see what

2758
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:49,840
happens and if it's if we don't get

2759
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:51,360
enough review i think then we just pass

2760
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:54,400
the problem back to eric and say

2761
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:58,239
figure out what to do um

2762
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:02,800
so yeah thank you okay um

2763
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,520
then daniel do you think it's ready or

2764
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:09,280
do you think you want one more reb

2765
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:13,040
your last one was in november

2766
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:16,239
yeah i think we need to to have one more

2767
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:19,040
update on that

2768
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:23,360
okay um then we will

2769
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:25,920
you know if you get it in soon then i

2770
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:28,239
think you know we can ride this wave of

2771
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:29,360
interest

2772
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:33,360
um so i would prefer sooner rather than

2773
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:34,000
later

2774
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,800
and then we can start the wglc on it

2775
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,239
okay work fine thanks

2776
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:46,000
okay so then let's go back to

2777
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,239
stub networks and what to do with that

2778
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:53,360
i think it's been pointed out it's not

2779
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,599
currently in our charter of course there

2780
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:57,360
could be

2781
01:52:57,360 --> 01:52:59,840
a recharter which as eric pointed out

2782
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:00,400
would be

2783
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:03,599
similar to uh having another wg

2784
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:07,199
um so eric

2785
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,599
i'd really like to get your perspective

2786
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:11,040
on

2787
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,520
where you would like to go with stub

2788
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,520
network since um you know there are a

2789
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,159
lot of

2790
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:19,360
options that are within interior

2791
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,159
so just before we go there um i mean i

2792
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:23,599
wonder

2793
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,040
these documents are pretty new i haven't

2794
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:26,719
read them in detail myself so so i think

2795
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:27,199
we should

2796
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,599
whatever we talk about here we should

2797
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:31,119
make that a bit contingent on waiting

2798
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:32,320
three four weeks so that people have a

2799
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,400
chance to read them as well yeah

2800
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,119
absolutely you are stealing my word i

2801
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:37,840
just

2802
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:39,599
basically browsed through it and got the

2803
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:42,159
id it's a way to take any decision

2804
01:53:42,159 --> 01:53:44,400
i do think it's personally right as an

2805
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,320
individual i do think it's an important

2806
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:46,960
work

2807
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,960
as an idea we need to take some more

2808
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,639
thinking and decide which is the best

2809
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:51,760
place

2810
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,040
right that's it we need to think

2811
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,719
basically

2812
01:53:56,719 --> 01:54:01,360
um and so then it sounds like also

2813
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:04,800
you know ted i think it would probably

2814
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,040
be good for

2815
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,199
also asking review in other working

2816
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:10,080
groups

2817
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:12,320
it doesn't hurt because it's not a

2818
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,320
working group draft it could actually

2819
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,320
get you know commentary from various

2820
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,799
places

2821
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:22,800
yeah it's actually been mentioned on iot

2822
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,599
ops and i think v6 ops as well

2823
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:27,760
but we haven't actually formally asked

2824
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,400
for review yet

2825
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:31,920
so so i guess one thing we could think

2826
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,520
about is whether

2827
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:34,719
we give people three or four weeks to

2828
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:36,719
read it and

2829
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:38,239
we we could think about organizing a

2830
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,080
kind of an inter home networking group

2831
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:41,280
session

2832
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:43,119
where you know where we would try and

2833
01:54:43,119 --> 01:54:44,480
flesh out more are people really

2834
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,760
interested in working on this and then

2835
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:49,040
if there's recharge or whatever

2836
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:51,119
you know i i don't know if doing it on

2837
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:52,719
the main i mean just

2838
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,000
is doing this all in the mailing list

2839
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,679
better or is organizing it kind of an

2840
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:57,199
interim in a month or

2841
01:54:57,199 --> 01:54:59,440
six weeks or so gonna be a better way to

2842
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:00,800
try and figure out what to do with with

2843
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:05,199
disturbed network stuff

2844
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:08,480
kind of think both i mean

2845
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:12,239
then why don't we have an interim

2846
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:15,360
on home net um both on the stub

2847
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:19,199
networks and you know to give

2848
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:23,599
um the authors of the name delegation

2849
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:27,199
a target for having their drafts out

2850
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:29,840
where we can you know they can give a

2851
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,840
brief presentation on what's changed and

2852
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:35,840
we can agree to launch wglc

2853
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:38,639
that is have about 10 minutes for that

2854
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:41,599
sort of thing um just to

2855
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,880
give it a push and a date and then spend

2856
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:47,199
time on stuff

2857
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:48,960
yeah i think you know some kind of date

2858
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,560
like that tends to get people

2859
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,520
reading and doing stuff yeah whereas if

2860
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,040
we try and only do it on the main list

2861
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:55,760
it might

2862
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:58,880
kind of just wither away again

2863
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:03,520
so okay i see daniel says deadlines are

2864
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:03,920
good

2865
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:08,800
okay okay then

2866
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:11,040
um okay so i guess he actually will be

2867
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:13,280
honest as chairs to try and

2868
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,360
do a doodle for six weeks each time or

2869
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,199
something like that

2870
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:21,360
yep that sounds good

2871
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:24,719
okay so we're coming close to the end

2872
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,800
are there things that we should discuss

2873
01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:29,840
that we haven't discussed

2874
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:37,199
