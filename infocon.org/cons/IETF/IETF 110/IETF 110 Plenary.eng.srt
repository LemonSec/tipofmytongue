51
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,879
meeting host for this meeting google

52
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,239
even though we're not meeting in person

53
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,720
these meetings still require a lot of

54
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,080
effort in the background

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,040
and the support of sponsors like google

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,319
is critical to

57
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,599
being able to deliver the meeting

58
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
experience that we all have so we are

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,920
deeply thankful to google for their

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,560
continuing support

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
and i think we have a video to queue up

62
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
next

63
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,720
hello i'm vince surf i'm vice president

64

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,759
but some of you

66
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,680
might know me as one of the fathers of

67
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
the internet

68
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
bob khan and i started the design work

69
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,080
on the internet in 1973

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,160
and the internet engineering task force

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
was started in 1986.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
those of you who've been participating

73
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,720
in ietf thank you

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,320
those of you who are interested in

75
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
participating please do

76
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,400
yeah you can't become a member all you

77
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
can do is show up and share your ideas

78
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
why is that important well the

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
internet's been evolving for the past

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,360
40 some odd years and to first order

81
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,440
the reason it's been evolving is to meet

82
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,039
new demands

83
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,680
and to incorporate new ideas coming from

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,039
people like you

85
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
at the ietf and so let me encourage you

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,639
to continue all of that creative work

87
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,560
it's a huge opportunity to keep

88
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,880
expanding the functionality and utility

89
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,240
of the internet

90
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:25,840
as it spreads around the world

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,759
excellent well that was very inspiring

92
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,639

again the the meetings couldn't couldn't

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,960
happen if not for the efforts of

105
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,400
a large number of people who

106
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
put in their time to make sure that

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,280
everything gets off smoothly and we've

108
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,560
had a really smooth

109
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
experience this time thus far so big

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
thanks to all of you

111
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,599
next

112
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,400
so this will be my report um just a few

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
topics first we're going to look at

114
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
participant statistics

115
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,440
uh look a little bit at the impact of

116
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
covet 19 on

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
activity in the ietf and talk about

118
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,560
planning for

119
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,199
future meetings so we go to the next one

120
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,800
so these are our statistics for this

121
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,919
meeting

122
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,560
same format as we've been doing for each

123
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
plenary during the pandemic

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,160
we have a good number of registrations

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
here

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,400
uh north of 1200 and we're pretty steady

127
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
on the fee waiver numbers as well

128
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,280
um a lot of people participating in the

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
hackathon virtually even though we can't

130
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
get together in person so that's

131
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
that's been great and um these are

132
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,319
especially for the meeting itself

133
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,680
these are the registration numbers we'll

134
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,880
have more detailed attendance numbers

135
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
um that get posted after the meeting is

136
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
over once we can um

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
identify actual attendance through the

138
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,080
whole week you can see here

139
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
also the country breakdown um

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,639
so we have a fairly typical split for us

141
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,720
but if we go to the next slide we can

142
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
look at this in more detail across the

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,120
last couple of years

144
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
so we thought we were inspired by

145
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
some folks who are collaborating during

146
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
the hackathon in the

147
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,560
who work on the big bang project and

148
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,479
nick doty in particular who

149
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,759
produced the chart that you're looking

150
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,639
at here so big thanks to nick

151
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,039
so what we're looking at is the

152
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
regional breakdown proportional

153
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,080
breakdown

154
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,280
for attendance at the lesson of

155
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,680
in-person meetings that we had 104 105

156
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,479
106

157
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,240
and the three virtual meetings that

158
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,479
we've had 107 108 109

159
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
prior to this one so if you look at the

160
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
first set of three 104

161
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
five and six um these show a fairly

162
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,560
typical

163
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
regional variation for us when we meet

164
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,159
in europe we have a higher

165
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
participation from people who are based

166
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,519
in europe

167
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,000
not too surprising same thing for north

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,279
america

169
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,159
same thing for for asia and the swings

170
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,120
there can be pretty

171
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
significant um some you know something

172
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,240
between 10 and 20

173
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,320
swings for each of those regions

174
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
depending on where we locate the

175
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,959
meetings

176
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,440
as we've switched to virtual it's much

177
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,480
more steady

178
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,560
um and caveat here a little bit that

179
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,160
ietf 107 was not

180
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,040
exactly the same format as 108 or 109 if

181
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,959
people recall it was a much shorter

182
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,560
day we did a much smaller number of

183
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,399
sessions so the data might not be

184
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,880
directly comparable um but nevertheless

185
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,720
we thought was interesting to look at

186
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,839
um so if you look here at 107 108 109

187
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,320
you can see that the the proportions are

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,519
much more stable

189
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,600
um and a little change there in 109 but

190
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,240
um some

191
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,839
something more in like a few percentage

192
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,519
points of swing for

193
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,200
for each of the largest regions from

194
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
which we get um participation

195
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,920
uh nothing like 10 or 20 um so that's i

196
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,720
think interesting

197
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
also because we have been rotating the

198
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
time zone of the

199
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
of the virtual meetings um but that

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,519
doesn't seem to affect

201
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,120
the regional distribution of the

202
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,040
participants as much as

203
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
um rotating the actual physical meeting

204
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,320
location

205
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,519
and then the last thing i'll say about

206
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,800
this is that the 104 105 106 numbers

207
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,440
these are just

208
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,760
the in-person attendees um they don't

209
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,200
include the remote participants

210
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
that might be interesting to look at as

211
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,560
well and and see what the differences

212
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,120
are

213
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,399
um all of this data is actually

214
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,560
available by the data tracker api

215
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,360
um so people who are interested can go

216
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,240
take a look at that

217
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
or if you're generally interested in

218
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,680
doing some analysis

219
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
on participation data of different kinds

220
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,519
not just meetings but also

221
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,320
mailing list analysis go take a look at

222
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
that big bang project

223
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,959
people are doing some some really

224
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
interesting work there

225
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,920
good collaboration next slide please

226
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
so the iesg's also been tracking a

227
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,320
little bit

228
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,040
the impact of covet 19 on a few

229
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
measures of participation we looked at

230
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,040
some of this data in the last

231
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
meeting but we've kind of built it out a

232
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
little bit more so i thought it would be

233
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,079
good to look at again here

234
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,160
so what you're looking at here is the

235
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,360
total volume of

236
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,160
email messages on ietf lists and we have

237
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
a four year comparison

238
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
from 2017 through 2020 2020 obviously

239
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,360
being

240
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,399
the dominated by the by the pandemic

241
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,680
year

242
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,279
and so for email traffic what we see is

243
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
that the email traffic during the

244
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,600
pandemic

245
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
uh last year was roughly in line with

246
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,079
what it has been in previous years a

247
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:08,720
little bit

248
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
a little bit higher um but you know

249
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,279
similar to what we've had in past

250
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,920
years we'll go to the next slide please

251
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
if we look at internet draft

252
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
publications we see

253
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
something fairly similar so a small dip

254
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
from 2019 to 2020 in terms of the total

255
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
number of internet draft publications

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
but not really a huge difference from

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,360
what we've seen in past years

258
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,760
so that's for total drafts published

259
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,360
and then if we go to the next one

260
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,360
well if we look at zero zero drafts

261
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,440
published here's where we start to see a

262
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
difference

263
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,680
so from 2019 to 2020

264
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,639
there's about a 16 drop in the total

265
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,200
number of zero zero drafts published

266
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
um which might tell us a little bit

267
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,720
about you know new work coming into the

268
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,839
ietf

269
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,079
and um the rate at which you know people

270
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,120
are

271
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
coming up with new ideas and thinking

272
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,079
that it's a good time to you know

273
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,000
publish a zero zero draft

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,040
i think a lot of people um

275
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,839
anecdotally who who do work in the itf

276
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,160
have

277
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
um have had this feeling that it's

278
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,519
harder to get new work

279
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,920
going without the hallway conversations

280
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,000
and the face-to-face interaction

281
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
um and i think this this particular

282
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,600
number um

283
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,480
illustrates that fairly well there's a

284
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
few things i'll say about that one is

285
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,160
that

286
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
there's lots of other ways that you can

287
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,360
attempt to measure

288
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
you know the impact of covid on

289
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
participation and the iesg is very

290
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,680
interested in people's ideas about that

291
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,200
we also had a little bit of discussion

292
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
about the rfc publication rate

293
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,560
and you know the rate of documents

294
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,320
coming into isg review those are more

295
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
like trailing indicators

296
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,639
this is more like a leading indicator

297
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,000
but it might be interesting to look at

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,600
trailing ones as well

299
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,560
um and we're also really interested in

300
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,200
people's

301
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,639
thoughts and ideas about how we can

302
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,920
try to make up the difference when we

303
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,079
can't meet in person so

304
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,320
if people have good ideas for you know

305
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
how we can sort of re-stimulate on some

306
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,320
of this new work activity

307
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,079
um or whether you you know even think

308
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,839
that this this isn't you know

309
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,519
cash accurately capturing um a trend of

310
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,120
of it being more difficult to start new

311
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,040
work um that would be

312
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
we're super interested in people's ideas

313
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
for that so please um you know come to

314
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,399
the mic at open mic or you can reach us

315
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,000
at our email address isg ietf.org

316
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,880
next slide please

317
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
so planning for future meetings people

318
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,399
may have seen

319
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,800
that the decision process for whether

320
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,199
itf-111

321
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,480
will run in person or not um began with

322
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
community consultation

323
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,279
last week it may have been the week

324
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,639
before actually when i'm not sure it was

325
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,160
last week when we wrote the slides or

326
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,120
actually was last week but feedback is

327
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,959
welcome on the mini couch's

328
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
mailing list there is like a very

329
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,560
structured and detailed

330
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,639
process that we've followed in the past

331
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,760
few rounds for

332
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
making the decision about whether to

333
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,360
move forward with an in-person meeting

334
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,519
or switch it to online and the proposal

335
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,839
is to follow that process again

336
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,000
so those who are interested please check

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,199
out the proposed process

338
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519

462
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
selected the two positions

463
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
um it's now for confirmation with the

464

iesg but it will only be announced

465
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
later in may because we coordinate this

466
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,559
with ice hock

467
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,000
and then one last announcement

468
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
um we have created a new position which

469
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,520
is called the iab

470
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
liaison coordinator position and we have

471
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,720
created a new male alias

472
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,360
that you can use to post any kind of

473
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,840
info

474
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
questions or information about liaisons

475
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,039
to us

476
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,840
we are currently in the process of

477
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,240
reviewing the liaison management process

478
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,480
and

479
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,919
these are oversight and set up

480
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,480
so you will hear more about this in

481
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,120
future

482
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,600
and this first step this first new

483
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
position is really to

the liaison managers

486
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
a clear contact point because that has

487
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,160
been missed in the part

488
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,520
in the past um but

489
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760

administrative side and not so much

496
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,919
technical side but it's a really

497
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,080
important topic for the iap so we will

498

next slide please

521
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,559
so as i'm sure most of you know the irtf

522
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,919
is a parallel organization to the ietf

523
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,840
that works to encourage collaboration

524
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,760
between the research community and the

525
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,640
standards community uh it's organized

526
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
there's a set of research groups

527
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,880
uh and those of the groups uh which are

528
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480

534
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,240
uh so i think some some really nice uh

535
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,000
research happening here

536
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
uh if you want to learn more about how

537
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,840

538
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,880
is a really nice primer for a

539
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
etf participants to introduce the way

540
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,400

please

543
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,120
in addition to the research groups

544
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,919
we also run the applied networking

545
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,360

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,840
uh to um recognize interesting new

555
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,840
research ideas uh which are of potential

556

and i just don't know what problem all

638
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
of y'all have in not just uh

639
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,559
volunteering in maths and reaching out

640
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,840
to andrew

641
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,600
um but anyway it was a good experience

642
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
uh the voting members were wonderful the

643
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,600
liaisons were wonderful

644
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,880
um the interviews using calendly to set

645
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,600

647
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,480
provided webex worked great

648

um the nominees were wonderful and

649
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,799
followed instructions

650
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,080
um so it was time consuming

651
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,720
but you know if anybody's uh thinking

652
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,919

got me through this past year of nom-com

669

um this is the list uh

670
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,039
and you know i i know that the rfc

671
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,559
actually said that somebody needed to

672
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
have a good sense of process but trust

673
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,039
me there are

674
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,600
so many people helpful people on the

675
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
ietf email list who are just

676

perfectly willing to help you out with

677
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,760

678
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,679
to be the strong suit

679
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,440
it certainly wasn't mine um okay so

680
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,440
next slide um these are some of the

681
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,440
takeaways uh and this was something that

682
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,000
actually

683
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,039
was probably for me the most stressful

684
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,279
part of the entire hong kong

685
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,640
process was the uh considerable

686
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,679
disconnect

687
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,720
between what the ietf community thought

688
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,760
it wanted from an

689
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,679
llc uh board member and

690
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,039
what the posted expectations

691
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,159
and desired expertise were and

692
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
also what the rfc uh defining the llc

693
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,520
said that was needed um so this is

694
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,279
you know something that the community

695
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,640
may want to think about

696
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,039
because there is the um

697
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,600
rfc 8711 does say that it should be

698
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,440
revisited about three years after

699
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,520
formation you'll need to consider giving

700
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,799
input

701
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,120
um and also i did communicate to the llc

702
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,840
that there was this disconnect

703
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,320
i think it reconnected okay so

704
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,279
i was saying that um you know i do think

705
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,320
that the llc

706
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,240
is working on uh

707
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,440
getting better communication i know

708
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
i've noticed a lot more from jay i've

709
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
noticed a lot more from jason i've

710
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,399
noticed people

711
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,799
you know are being invited to the open

712
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,360
part of the llc board meetings

713
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,520
and so if you feel that there's this

714
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,919
disconnect i strongly encourage people

715
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,960
to take advantage of these opportunities

716
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,960
that are being presented to all of us

717
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,159
in order to take your step

718
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,279
in being better connected

719
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,799
next slide

720
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,480
um just some others uh some people in

721
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,200
the community thought it might be useful

722
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,399
if they had some more information

723
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,279
on what people wanted to accomplish as

724
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,480
part of being

725
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,600
um a candidate for

726
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
a particular position um so just some

727
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,520
things to

728
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,720
consider you know if anybody wants to

729
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,080
create a new rfc or organizer

730
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,000
i don't know what process is not my

731
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,440
strong suit but

732
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
you know maybe consider the the

733
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,559
existence of a pro

734
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
public profile with a statement for

735
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,480
nominees and maybe their picture

736
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
right there um consider a town hall

737
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,039
discussion for ietf chair which of

738
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,559
course won't be happening for

739
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,159
this year um where maybe people can get

740
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,720
a better sense of the candidates because

741
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,240
um while you know to be

742
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,720
widely known within ietf probably means

743
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,320
you're only known to about half of the

744
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,520
people in ietf

745
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,440
and other people might have opinions on

746
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,039
what you'd like to accomplish but may

747
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,760
not

748
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,360
have opinions on who you are

749
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,240
because they don't know you um another

750
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,960
comment

751
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,440
uh and this came from some of the people

752
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,559
who

753
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,159
are not employed by big vendors uh

754
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,120
and are individual contractors and such

755
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,520
and need to get funding for support

756
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,840
um there was a sense that maybe if

757
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,679
there's anything we can do to shorten

758
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,520
the duration

759
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,559
of time between putting your name in the

760
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,200
hat and

761
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,039
getting the decision that would be

762
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,480
helpful again this

763
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,720
would be something you know process

764
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,760
people might

765
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,880
need to look at um

766
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,200
and then you know just another takeaway

767
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,279
and i gave this one at the last uh

768
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,440
session is you know you saw the

769
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,200
statistics from

770
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
alyssa as to who's participating

771
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,520
and in none of those charts did uh north

772
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,440
america get over 60 percent

773
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,919
from what i saw and it tended to be

774
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,520
trending around 50 percent

775
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,080
and yet 65 percent of the nominee pool

776
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
seem to be coming

777
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,039
from north america um so i think this

778
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,080
is something we can improve on and you

779
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,640
know i'm

780
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,919
uh really intrigued by the work that

781
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,559
keith and fernando are doing to try to

782
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,279
document

783
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,480
some of the additional ways to improve

784
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,519
diversity

785
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,840
that they're putting a draft in gen

786
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,559
dispatch

787
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,880
and things like that so i do hope that

788
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,679
this

789
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,039
is a conversation that continues on how

790
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,480
to um make leadership

791
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,320
look more like participants

792
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,039
moving right along to the next slide

793
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,720
uh okay nominees did like the flexible

794
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,000
interview schedule

795
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,799
um you know i had times pretty much all

796
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,799
across the day there was a six hour time

797
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,519
slot

798
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,840
during the a lot of people's middle of

799
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,279
the night

800
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
um that we didn't have any but in

801
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,480
general it seemed to work really well

802
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,760
um that there was an interesting

803
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,080
concept that incumbency nomcom feedback

804
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,960
is the only way

805
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,360
they can get feedback on how they're

806
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,799
doing their job

807
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,440
so you know it may be useful if we

808
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,880
considered other

809
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,240
mechanisms for providing

810
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,000
current leadership with feedback

811
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,720
um it shouldn't be too hard to do

812
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,440
i think uh it should probably you know

813
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
feedback

814
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,120
should be separated from mom com nom-com

815
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,600
really

816
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,799
is not the best way for feedback to

817
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,760
happen

818
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,799
um there was a request to coordinate

819
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,640
candidate announcements with

820
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,159
uh press release and public relations

821
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,279
um and so maybe you know bring

822
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,480
in somebody like greg wood uh

823
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
before the announcement goes out so that

824
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,240
he could have things ready

825
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,360
from a pr perspective um

826
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,440
before the announcements that get get

827
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,200
shipped and i'll certainly work with the

828
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,159
next uh

829
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,720
numcom chair on that if maybe if that's

830
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,159
okay with

831
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,559
you know maybe we need a discussion on

832
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,240
the process of whether that's acceptable

833
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,360
um and then you know one thing i'd like

834
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,679
to

835
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,039
get help from that would be really good

836
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,600
from a tools perspective is we've got to

837
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,760
get rid of the 77 column pre-wrapped

838
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,480
ascii

839
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,440
for providing um questionnaire responses

840
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,880
and it would be really nice if we had a

841
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,440
web form

842
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,320
and you know a major takeaway is yes

843
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,960
numcom

844
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,480
can be done remotely i think it clearly

845
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,279
it can be done 100 remotely and i also

846
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,000
think

847
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,640
that it can be done remotely by just a

848
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,880
portion of the members and nominees

849
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,919
and so there should not be any

850
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,399
expectation or requirement

851
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,080
that uh you know going forward even

852
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,360
that non-pom members or nominees have to

853
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,080
be

854
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,679
present for interviews for meetings for

855
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:58,399
any of that

856
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,039
they we need to be able to support all

857
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,120
of this remotely going forward even once

858
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,200
we get to meet in person again

859
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,399
okay i think uh

860
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,440
let's see next slide and i do have some

861
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,000
things

862
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,679
that i needed to mention that i didn't

863
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,440
put on a slide

864
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,040
um so i forgot to put a slide together

865
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,079
about the community feedback questions

866
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,520
so i'm just going to run through those

867
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,480
really quick

868
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,719
um there was a question about iesg

869
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,199
expectations of proposed standard

870
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,320
um so they were unhappy people

871
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,159
and they were satisfied people and there

872
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,839
was no consensus on this

873
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,399
and it to me and it seemed that the

874
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,679
unhappiness was

875
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,239
mostly impacted by personal experience

876
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,040
with specific drafts

877
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,199
rather than general trends really

878
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,079
because we don't

879
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,199
have statistics on general trends

880
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,879
um iesg as servants of the community

881
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,000
um motherhood and apple pie

882
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,839
absolutely it was agreed that this was

883
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,359
generally how it should be

884
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,560
but there was some pushback that one job

885
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,440
of the steering committee is to steer

886
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,200
um with that said there were

887
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,359
views from some people that they

888
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,240
actually think

889
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,720
the various i groups are doing a good

890
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,599
job with this

891
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,599
and there are some people who felt there

892
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,520
did not and so i could not say that

893
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
there was any consensus

894
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,240
as to the current state of affairs as to

895
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,839
whether people are living up to the

896
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,079
expectation of iesg

897
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,320
and others as servants of the community

898
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,839
um and again

899
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,400
the view seemed impacted by specific

900
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
personal experiences

901
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,880
and how people perceive things you know

902
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,880
glasses half full or empty or things

903
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,160
like that

904
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,200
um engaging with external impacted

905
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,240
stakeholders

906
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,800
uh in general there does seem to be a

907
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,440
belief

908
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,079
that the ietf cannot exist in a vacuum

909
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,760
and needs to engage with open source

910
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,119
community opera

911
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,400
community with operators with other sdos

912
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,280
and with um others in order to remain

913
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,359
relevant and to avoid having

914
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,119
our efforts driven to other

915
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,119
organizations this opinion was not

916
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,520
universal some perceived ietf to be in a

917
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,079
position

918
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,560
of strength where it could dictate how

919
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,480
things happen in the world but i would

920
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
say that the consensus view was one of

921
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
engagement and humility

922
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,880
um recycling leadership and returning

923
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
incumbents

924
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
and this was not a direct question to

925
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,760
the community

926
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
but it did get discussed post

927
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,200
announcement

928
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,520
of the candidates and it was certainly

929
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,680
considered in a lot of the feedback on

930
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,040
specific candidates or specific nominees

931
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,839
um in i would have to say there is

932
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,400
strong consensus that people who have a

933
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,160
single term under their belt and are

934
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,920
doing a good job should be given a

935
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,359
second term

936
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,640
um there is a learning curve and so

937
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,359
there is

938
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,640
not a strong push

939
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,359
in any way shape or form to simply have

940
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,560
new leadership with

941
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,920
every cycle um now with that

942
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,240
said i did notice a strong trend that

943
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,040
once

944
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,000
uh former leaders are out of leadership

945
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,800
for

946
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,000
multiple years um maybe four or five

947
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,079
certainly more than five years there

948
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,920
seems to be a significant number of

949
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,880
people who prefer not to put them back

950
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,280
in

951
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,880
not as a.d um iab was a little less

952
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,920
clear but even

953
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,480
there there was a strong um you know

954
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,560
this person's already been there

955
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
done that um we'd like to see new people

956
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,880
um and that doesn't mean that people who

957
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,720
have been leadership in the past

958
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,359
shouldn't try but i can say that there

959
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,400
was

960
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,680
a fairly strong feedback

961
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,880
of that ilk um

962
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,040
there is a strong sense that iab seems

963
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,760
to be a place where ads go to retire

964
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,960
um but even there you know there's a

965
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,160
difference between

966
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,680
if you're a recent ad or current a d

967
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,040
who's stepping out of an a d position um

968
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,599
there's a lot of uh support for those

969
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,480
people

970
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,599
and so there wasn't a push to not do

971
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,359
that in the iab

972
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,720
but you know again the the recent people

973
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,119
there the feedback that i saw was

974
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,640
different from what i saw

975
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,880
for feedback who of people who had been

976
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,680
80s a lot

977
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,720
while previously and um

978
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,240
that simply is what it is and

979
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,359
i can't speak to necessarily why that is

980
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,800
um but i did see a lot of that and so

981
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,040
you know i hope the next mom com chair

982
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,160
has as good

983
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,520
luck as i did and uh

984
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,759
you all have fun it's not my job anymore

985

00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,480
in past meetings that uh as ellis noted

1002
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,720
they depend really on uh the sponsors

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,119
we've restructured the itf

1018
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,319
sponsorship program and the aim of that

1019
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,160
is to align the opportunities and

1020
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,480
benefits of sponsoring the ietf so that

1021
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
they're

1022
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,680
more appealing to current and potential

1023
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,920
sponsors they're easier to administer

1024
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,560
and

1025
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,960
they provide greater certainty for both

1026
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,079
the itf and

1027
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,119
sponsor organizations so um more more

1028
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,200
details available on the idea of website

1029
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,000

1030
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,040

uh as i was i just noticed a few days

1088
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,520
ago that the first

1089
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,680
message to the many couches emailed us

1090
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,760
that alyssa mentioned earlier

1091
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,000
actually happened about five years ago

1092
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,720
around this time and the first message

1093
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,200
is

1094
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,119
included questions about whether or not

1095
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,800
it would be possible to hold

1096
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,920
meetings with people on the order on the

1097
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,359
order of a thousand people

1098
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,520
all everybody from home uh would that

1099
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,960
even be possible and what are the issues

the important point i think from the itf

00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,000
lc point of view is that

1157

you can see that we've exceeded the

1158
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,000
plans or the expectations

1159
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,880

new person

1199
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,800
on the board as a result of his new

1200
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,760
position

1201
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,160
so we're welcoming him to the board he's

1202
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,359
joined our

1203
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,119
official lists as of today and we've

1204
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:20,880
been working the past few weeks to

1205
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,119
onboard him and prepare him for

1206
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,000
everything

1207
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,960
related to the board uh next slide

1208
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,160
of course we very very very much wish to

1209
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:32,720
thank our

1210
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,440
outgoing board member alyssa cooper of

1211
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,040
course she was not only the

1212
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,040
itf chair but she also served on the lc

1213
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,240
board for

1214
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,680
several years since its creation of

1215
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,839
course and i think it's important to go

1216
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,760
back and look at the entire

1217
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,240
sort of life cycle of the process um for

1218
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,839
iasa 2 if you will

1219
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,280
all right hopefully i'm back at the

1220
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,440
beginning of the iasa 2 process

1221
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,880
alyssa was really part of helping

1222
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,599
organize the ietf helping create a

1223
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,880
working group

1224
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,839
and try to achieve some consensus in the

1225
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,599
organization of the itf

1226
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,839
about where we needed to go and then was

1227
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,200
able to get the lc

1228
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,440
formed and cooperation and partnership

1229
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,640
with isoc

1230
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,000
and then able to serve on the

1231
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,839
initial interim board and then of course

1232
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,040
the first

1233
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,520
full board so she's been a part of this

1234
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,520
effort for many many years predating all

1235
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,880
of us on the board

1236
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,400
and we really appreciate her

1237
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,800
contributions not just to the board but

1238
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,240
to the itf

1239
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,359
more broadly i would also say i'm sure

1240
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,359
she's very eager to have some extra

1241
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,160
personal time

1242
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,280
to devote to other activities and

1243
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,599
we are going to be sharing usually we

1244
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,280
would do this at the stage but we will

1245
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,160
be sharing

1246
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,559
uh some gifts with her to help you know

1247
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,720
her and her family enjoy some

1248
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,160
much deserved time off and a little bit

1249
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,319
of break and more family time

1250
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,319
so thank you melissa really appreciate

1251
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:10,000

1252
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,800

1254
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,200
we do have a board meeting

1255
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,760
uh later this week on the 11th which i

1256
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,400
think

1257
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,040
is actually tomorrow um so you're you're

1258
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,839
welcome to that

1259
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,440
um you can find the links at the bottom

1260
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,520
that get you the webex information

1261
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,079
as well as the agenda i'll also note

1262
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,680
that at this meeting

1263
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,839
tomorrow we are finalizing the agenda

1264
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,680
for our strategic retreat

1265
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,480
which will take place the 24th and 25th

1266
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,520
of march

1267
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,240
that will also be largely open i think

1268
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,000
there's only one small section that is

1269
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,960
not open

1270
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,200
so we'll be posting after the board

1271
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,520
meeting the agenda for that retreat

1272
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,680
and uh webex links and so on so you're

1273
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,760
welcome to join us for that as well

1274
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,520
and we've got comment periods of course

1275
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,280
throughout to get feedback

1276
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,040
so thank you next slide

1277
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,200
so um some current work we obviously

1278
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,160
concluded the

1279
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,800
community survey um that was one of the

1280
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,400
recommendations that came out of the

1281
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,240
nom-com and we implemented that in

1282
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,280
december

1283
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,280
and i think had feedback open on the

1284
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,040
survey through january to allow people

1285
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,800
to comment through the holidays

1286
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,359
and we circulated results posted a blog

1287
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,240
about that

1288
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,920
i think the only comment i would have

1289
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,680
there is it would be great to have more

1290
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,800
respondents

1291
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,599
next year when we do it um number two

1292
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:31,920
we're

1293
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,720
finishing up a uh sort of the

1294
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,480
preparation of the fiscal year

1295
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,599
financials and completion of an

1296
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:40,079
independent

1297
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,359
audit as we did last year i already

1298
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:45,520
noted the strategic retreat

1299
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,680
i will just make a quick note of the

1300
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,720
items that we

1301
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
so far in our draft agenda are focusing

1302
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,680
on one is community engagement

1303
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,800
two is how to kick off the iasa ii

1304
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,800
retrospective three is fundraising

1305
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,960
four is improving diversity and

1306
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,480
inclusion

1307
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,359
five is what does postcovid return to

1308
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:08,400
normal look like

1309
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,480
for the organization and what

1310
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,000
implications would that have

1311
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,839
administratively technically and

1312
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,200
financially

1313
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,599
and then finally reviewing any

1314
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,800
additional

1315
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,880
strategic administrative or technical

1316
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,079
debt that we need to have the

1317
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,480
organization focus on

1318
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,720
um so that brings us to item 4 here as i

1319
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,000
mentioned fundraising

1320
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
we're very close to having that

1321
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,119
fundraiser on board

1322
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,240
jay's working on that diligently the

1323
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,160
iosa 2 retrospective

1324
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,599
i mentioned that in our retreat that's

1325
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,520
where we'll be really digging into that

1326
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,880
for the first time

1327
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,520
this was required it was put into the

1328
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
the rfcs and bcps

1329
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,160
when we kicked off the iasa 2 or

1330
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,079
approved the iso2 structure

1331
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,240
that we would conduct a retrospective to

1332
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,160
see if there were any gaps

1333
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,640
in the iasa 2 structure if there are any

1334
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,480
things that we would like to tweak

1335
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,400
i think the idea was instead of doing

1336
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,280
this once every 10 plus years

1337
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,400
to do it on a somewhat more agile basis

1338
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,520
though i think three years still a

1339
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,200
little bit waterfall but in any case

1340
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,720
come back and see if there are

1341
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,240
minor course corrections that we want to

1342
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,760
do organizationally

1343
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,079
and of course if there are and

1344
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,599
identifying what those are going to

1345
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,000
require a lot of community consultation

1346
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,680
and sorting out how we're going to want

1347
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,359
to work that is something we're

1348
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,920
going to work on soon and i mentioned of

1349
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,599
course i'm boarding our new board member

1350
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,400
next slide please

1351
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,680
uh so these are the the latest um

1352
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,480
financials

1353
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,520
based on december balances um

1354
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,920
the only two notes here is the some of

1355
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,000
the net income differences

1356
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,319
um and we'll have more information about

1357
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:45,440
this one the

1358
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,680
financials are are shared this is

1359
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,359
largely due to when we are

1360
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,960
recognizing the revenue from the

1361
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,400
internet society

1362
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,680
and so we had a certain amount of

1363
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,760
revenue that um

1364
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,920
was forecast for this year based on

1365
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,680
prior process

1366
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,839
however based on the new deal with the

1367
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,839
internet society

1368
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,359
those funds are actually coming in the

1369
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,520
first quarter of this fiscal year

1370
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,200
um and there'll be more phones of course

1371
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,040
so that will explain some of those

1372
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,480
differences we'll explain them in the

1373
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,440
notes

1374
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,480
when the fiscal year is closed um and

1375
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,760
then on investments

1376
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,359
you know the only thing i will note here

1377
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,200
is don't expect returns like that

1378
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,640
in any other year um we really um

1379
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,400
lucked out in a way i mean it was really

1380
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,160
the result of good planning

1381
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,040
but some of it was luck in essence when

1382
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,599
we got

1383
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,880
our investment funds from the internet

1384
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,839
society

1385
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,400
they were all kept in cash until such

1386
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,119
time as we

1387
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,160
completed the investment policy and once

1388
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,040
we did

1389
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,720
have the policy that said how we would

1390
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,319
invest and what our diversification

1391
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,200
would be

1392
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,520
then we had to decide over what time

1393
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,200
period to invest

1394
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,680
and because of the the covid 19 pandemic

1395
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,119
beginning

1396
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,000
last year the stock market in the late

1397
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,559
first quarter really took a nosedive

1398
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,800
and so as a result of that we felt that

1399
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,920
represented

1400
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,160
an unprecedented opportunity to buy into

1401
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:08,960
the market

1402
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,880
and so working with goldman sachs our

1403
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,720
investment advisor we decided to pull in

1404
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,119
some of our planned investment timing

1405
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,400
and were able to benefit from the uplift

1406
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,599
in the stock markets

1407
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,559
globally since that time so great

1408
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,839
benefit now

1409
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:26,079
but don't expect returns like that in

1410
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,440
the future especially given our

1411
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,000
conservative investment profile

1412
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
um next slide please

1413
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,720
so these are all the ways you can get in

1414
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,079
contact with us

1415
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,559
next slide

1416
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,640
and that's it for now thank you very

1417
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:53,839
much for your time

1418

1420
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,119
on the ietf trust activities next slide

1421
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,440
please

1422
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,400
next slide please uh so the ihf trust is

1423
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,680
made up of five members

1424
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,160
uh i'm the chair uh kathleen moriarty is

1425
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,880
our treasurer

1426
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,280
uh the other trustees are joel halpern

1427
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,680
john levine and stephen wenger

1428
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,400
joel uh was just re-uh re-upped for

1429
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,160
another three-year term by the nom-com

1430
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,359
and so we welcome joel

1431
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,960
to back and continue on his service as a

1432
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,960
trustee next slide please

1433
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
so a lot of people uh don't really hear

1434
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,760
much about the itf trust and we're

1435
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,640
probably the most

1436
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,119
misunderstood part of the itf uh simply

1437
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,119
put the purpose of the itf trust and the

1438
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,960
reason it was created

1439
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,200
was to manage the ip assets for the ietf

1440
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,119
with the goal of making them easy to use

1441
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,640
and available to use but while

1442
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,400
protecting the ownership

1443
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,520
of those assets so that the ietf retains

1444
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,079
control

1445
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,319
and and is able to do with its assets

1446
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,599
what it wants to do

1447
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,880
uh with one uh ex we focus on the if

1448
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,599
one extension was done in 2016 uh as

1449
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,760
part of the nti ayana transition

1450
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,920
uh there's some material from the iana

1451
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,839
that also came into the trust care

1452
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:20,319
such as iana.org uh the domain

1453
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,319
registration and things like that

1454
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,240
and so we serve both the itf and the

1455
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
broader community

1456
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,079
uh so if you ever wonder who owns the

1457
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,480
domains like itf.org and all the other

1458
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,359
kind of stuff

1459
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,880
and who takes care of the registrations

1460
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,480
well that's one of the things we do

1461
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,640
we also manage the copyrights logos

1462
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,240
photos things like that

1463
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,480
uh trademarks as well as software so

1464
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,160
when tools and rfc tools and things like

1465
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,079
the yang catalog are published

1466
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,599
we worry about the licenses there and

1467
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,799
make sure that everything's kept in

1468
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:47,520
order

1469
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,119
one thing we don't do by the way is we

1470
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,520
don't do patents so we do ip but not

1471
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,559
patents

1472
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,359
next slide please

1473
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,839
so uh the trust is a fairly quiet uh

1474
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,200
group compared to

1475
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,839
certainly groups like the llc uh the iab

1476
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:04,640
and the isg

1477
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,200
and working groups uh because hopefully

1478
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,480
not a lot of legal stuff needs to be

1479
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,440
done uh

1480
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,720
but there's a few things we do need to

1481
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,880
keep up to date one of them was the itf

1482
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,760
trust website

1483
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,280
i don't think it had been updated since

1484
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,920
the itf trust was originally created

1485
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,559
many many years ago so we undertook in

1486
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,079
2020

1487
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,559
we restructuring the website updating it

1488
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:25,599
refreshing it

1489
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,040
uh so that no longer looked like

1490
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,799
something out of the mid 1990s

1491
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,400
we brought it up to date with you know

1492
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,799
early 2000s at least

1493
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,119
styling one of the big reasons we did

1494
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,480
this by the way was

1495
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,480
we wanted to create an easier way for

1496
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,319
the community to engage where they

1497
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:41,920
needed to engage with the trust

1498
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,680
which is primarily around licensing you

1499
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,760
know we get requests for licensing rcs

1500
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,440
how do you do that we get requests for

1501
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,119
licensing using our logos

1502
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,880
stuff like that uh this is meant to

1503
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,640
be a front door and help people

1504
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,480
understand what that process is

1505
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,760
how to engage with it and how to work

1506
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,079
with it the other thing we've done

1507
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,760
recently in

1508
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,599
late 2020 we did a consultation with the

1509
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:07,040
itf community

1510
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,040
around some clarification of the iana

1511
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,520
parameter registry usages uh

1512
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,640
they uh themselves as stated if you look

1513
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,640
at them they don't bear a copyright

1514
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,880
uh statement uh we had to take a look at

1515
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,319
that and decide what was the

1516
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:21,839
appropriate thing we did a consultation

1517
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,440
with the community

1518
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,280
feedback our goal of course is to make

1519
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,200
these things easy to use with

1520
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,480
minimal uh process and so

1521
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,240
uh in keeping with that we've heard from

1522
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,920
the community and now we're working with

1523
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,960
ayanna

1524
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,599
and i can legal to get the actual

1525
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,119
implementation the right way to

1526
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,000
label that material on the iana registry

1527
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,359
parameter registry site

1528
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:44,559
and make sure that we get the stuff that

1529
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,880
we want included in

1530
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,839
the open access and make sure the things

1531
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,280
which we don't have the rights to or

1532
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,000
need to be

1533
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,839
uh bran you know bracketed off and

1534
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,920
protected uh because maybe the itf

1535
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,960
doesn't have uh

1536
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,040
rights over them to say what the rules

1537
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,119
should be uh are correctly implemented

1538
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,400
so we're working with ayanna

1539
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,240
expect something uh to be coming

1540
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,599
announced up hopefully

1541
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,160
in q1 or early q2 i guess we're getting

1542
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,359
pretty close to q2

1543
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:14,319
uh 2021 on that next slide please

1544
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,319
so we have some other stuff we've been

1545
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,480
working on uh we of course

1546
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,720
daily or you know as they come up will

1547
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,640
handle license requests for trust assets

1548
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,680
that's just part of our normal

1549
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:24,960
day-to-day business

1550
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,480
one of the things we however have been

1551
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,079
taking a look at is we're looking at to

1552
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:28,559
see

1553
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:30,720
new situations that are coming up such

1554
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,559
as around the github repositories

1555
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,240
and what the appropriate way to label

1556
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,200
things and make sure things are

1557
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,319
protected

1558
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,079
in addition we had requests suddenly

1559
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,599
coming in for

1560
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,240
things that are non-traditional uh

1561
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:42,640
things

1562
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,000
the itf would grant usage rights to

1563
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,400
people outside the itf2 things like

1564
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,400
wikis and stuff like that

1565
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,160
this is above and beyond our traditional

1566
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,920
rfc content that we already have

1567
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,920
well-established processes for managing

1568
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,319
or things like our trademarks we of

1569
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,079
course ongoing we maintain

1570
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,760
our registered trademarks that's uh we

1571
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,119
do that around the world

1572
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,640
uh they are not things you just do once

1573
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,839
and you walk away from you have to

1574
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:06,880
maintain them you have to

1575
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,799
register them uh and make sure that they

1576
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,480
are kept up to date and we also well

1577
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,520
defend them

1578
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,760
in case somebody infringes upon them you

1579
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,440
have a requirement to defend the mark or

1580
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,359
you can lose the right to use it

1581
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,640
uh the other thing is we're working on a

1582
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,640
couple of things right now uh

1583
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,440
we've been re-looking at the early rfc

1584
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,799
author assignments uh

1585
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,359
that were done if you know some of the

1586
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,799
history of the itf

1587
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,200
the trust came into existence fairly

1588
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,160
late into in the itf's long existence

1589
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,720
and so the early rfc assignments uh were

1590
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,000
handled a little bit differently than

1591
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,319
the

1592
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,240
ones that are today and so we've been

1593
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,599
reviewing that and we're going to go

1594
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,200
back and make sure that everything

1595
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,799
all the transfers all the assignments

1596
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,079
are in order and that we have all the

1597
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,720
paperwork

1598
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,520
uh in hand and that those things are all

1599
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,760
really well done and documented

1600
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,680
uh likewise we're going through and

1601
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,960
reviewing and updating the list of

1602
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,799
assets held by the itf trust

1603
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,640
uh the iff trust is volunteers and

1604
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,839
there's been a lot turnover through the

1605
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:00,480
years

1606
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,160
uh and so one of these we're trying to

1607
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,839
make sure we've done is that everything

1608
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,200
and all the institutional knowledge

1609
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,960
including the list of every asset we

1610
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:07,599
have

1611
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,599
is well documented and published on our

1612
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,960
website

1613
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,760
next slide please

1614
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,400
finally if you need to get a hold of us

1615
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,680
there's a really

1616
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,040
uh spiffy new design website

1617
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,760
trustee.itf.org

1618
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,880
or you can email at trustees itf.org

1619
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,200
thank you

1620
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,000
good day so i'm here i'm magnus westland

1621
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,760
i'm here to talk about applying and

1622
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,599
evolving quick for every one of you

1623
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,200
so next slide and i'm the outgoing

1624
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,160
transport lady

1625
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,720
so uh i had the pleasure to quite

1626
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,240
recently approve

1627
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,200
quick version zero one zero zero zero

1628
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,079
zero one and

1629
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,200
http three uh and this is

1630
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,799
it's been almost five years since the

1631
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,720
buff

1632
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,880
and seen lots and lots of github issues

1633
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,200
over 2000 there's been almost eight and

1634
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,559
a half thousand emails on the working

1635
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,240
group email list

1636
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:12,400
they've been 23 different meetings of

1637
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,920
the group

1638
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,240
and some 2021 interoperability drafts of

1639
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,280
different points of

1640
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,760
quick during development with over 20

1641
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:24,319
different implementations being involved

1642
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:25,839
they also been quite a lot of slack

1643
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,480
discussion between implementers

1644
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,799
and the result here is really six high

1645
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,319
quality documents which i'm very

1646
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,640
grateful

1647
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,079
and i really want to thank everyone

1648
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,680
that's been involved in this process i

1649
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,599
do note that when you take the github

1650
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:40,240
process

1651
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,160
beyond the working group stage beyond

1652
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,079
what rc

1653
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,720
describes we did run into some process

1654
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,640
issues should say with an atf class

1655
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,400
called an isd review

1656
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,160
one for example about collecting

1657
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,240
feedback in idf lost call

1658
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,200
and the review teams that don't see that

1659
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,480
request

1660
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,400
it's just one example so there's a few

1661
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,160
things here for isd and the

1662
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:06,079
idf is large to work on i think

1663
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,640
next slide

1664
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,880
so http 3 usage

1665
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,079
is already quite extensive on the in the

1666
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:16,480
web

1667
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,599
it will continue to grow and will evolve

1668
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,160
i also expect to see much more https

1669
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:22,720
usage

1670
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,839
with http 3 for other applications than

1671
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,640
the normal web

1672
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,920
and use quick as a transport protocol

1673
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,760
maybe for your protocol so that's

1674
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,960
it's been started somewhere we have two

1675
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,520
known views in idf it's dns over quick

1676
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,240
and mask

1677
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,319
there's some more different cases under

1678
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,359
consideration

1679
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,880
it's not been adopted yet so it's time

1680
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,799
for you i think to really ask yourself

1681
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:50,640
if it's time to start using quick for

1682
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,640
you uh or not

1683
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,559
so let's see what you need to think

1684
01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:56,079
about if you're going to do that

1685
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:59,839
next slide

1686
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:03,200
so application mappings or high upper

1687
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,280
layer protocol or highla protocol

1688
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,079
mappings

1689
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,119
onto quick http 3 is just one such

1690
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,480
example

1691
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,319
you can do it in your own working group

1692
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,480
you can do it in other seos or

1693
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,240
your organizations or companies

1694
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,480
i would recommend you to read the

1695
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,400
applicability draft

1696
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,319
it's not yet ready for publication but

1697
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,280
it will soon

1698
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,200
and if you have any questions don't

1699
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,880
hesitate to consult the quick working

1700
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,720
group it's shares or potentially

1701
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,559
transport ids so what's

1702
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,760
good to know here is that if you trying

1703
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,559
to do this

1704
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,039
realize just missing something quick and

1705
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,559
you would need a quick extensions to

1706
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,079
solve your issue

1707
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,559
you that's one case where you really

1708
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,200
should start

1709
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,720
discussing with a quick working group

1710
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,839
because if this is general

1711
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:56,319
extension then maybe it should be done

1712
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,760
in quick working group

1713
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,599
as that general extensions if it's

1714
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,200
something very very specific

1715
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,799
it might be fine that you do it in your

1716
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,520
own group and another thing if you start

1717
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,160
experimenting or working with this

1718
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,480
don't hesitate to register a provisional

1719
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,079
code point by jana for any of the

1720
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,240
registration

1721
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,400
so and do that as soon as you're ready

1722
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,079
to actually start

1723
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,119
having that implementation quick has a

1724
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,880
lot of extension space there's no

1725
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,319
shortage of code points

1726
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,119
most fields are 32-bit longs and the

1727
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:29,280
registration rules are very

1728
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,920
open so to say so don't hesitate to

1729
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,680
register

1730
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,640
at this stage we're also doing a quick

1731
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,839
recharging the

1732
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:40,400
it's out for external review currently

1733
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,440
it's uh

1734
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,960
continuing in the working european

1735
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,880
maintenance evolution of the basis

1736
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,160
specifications it's also continuing

1737
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,559
on the operational been started but some

1738
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:51,920
new things like

1739
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,119
q log for example is being considered

1740
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,039
and and enabled by this new charter and

1741
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,160
also general extensions is is what the

1742
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,559
group is charted for

1743
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:09,039
so i hope now you have some more idea

1744
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:09,599
where

1745
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,000
quick is and that it's ready it

1746
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,680
hopefully it will be published within

1747
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,400
weeks

1748
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,200
the first basic specs so there's nothing

1749
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,880
that prevents you from using it from a

1750
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,319
reference point

1751
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,319
and i have the possibility if someone

1752
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,319
has any clarification question or

1753
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:25,359
anything around this

1754
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,119
they willing you can step up to the

1755
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,400
queue and

1756
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,599
ask your question before i hand this

1757
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,839
over

1758
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:42,160
so see if that was clear enough uh thank

1759
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,440
you let's

1760
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,839
go on

1761
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,440
yes uh thank you magnus and then it's

1762
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,960
actually back to me at this point

1763
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,119
and we go into the recognition part um

1764
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,000
if we go on the next slide

1765
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,039
we start with the iab um we have this

1766
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:01,599
times

1767
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,640
uh four outgoing ib members and

1768
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,039
one of them is of course alyssa who has

1769
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,440
as the ietf chair has also been a member

1770
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,720
of the iab i have to say um i really

1771
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,000
enjoyed working with her the last year

1772
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,760
but also the years before where i was an

1773
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,240
ihd member and so had like even closer

1774
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,680
contact with her

1775
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,359
i think she has like a very pragmatic

1776
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,200
approach very often and there has been

1777
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,240
some very difficult

1778
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,839
decisions she had to take in the in the

1779
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,359
last couple of years

1780
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,760
um but she's usually very good and like

1781
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,880
kind of listening to

1782
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,400
the discussion but then also finding the

1783
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,400
right point of time where

1784
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,599
the discussion maybe just goes in

1785
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,520
circles and she can make a

1786
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,640
pragmatic proposal to move forward um

1787
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,520
and that's kind of that's an uh a skill

1788
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,480
which i admire

1789
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,119
maybe that's my german gems um but i

1790
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:48,160
think that was also

1791
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,960
a skill that was very useful on the ib

1792
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,480
and the discussions we had over the last

1793
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:52,960
year

1794
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,839
where she was always actively

1795
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,319
contributing

1796
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:58,799
bring him uh bring him our own views but

1797
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:00,079
also views uh

1798
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:02,960
in her position um so i think she will

1799
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,000
be missed there and

1800
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,400
and we'll see if last can replace her in

1801
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,160
that sense but like as his german i have

1802
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,280
some hope

1803
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,079
um but i also want to thank all the

1804
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:12,720
other

1805
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,920
three ib members who are stepping down

1806
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,600
this time

1807
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,080
i'm stephen has been on the iab since

1808
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,520
2019 but similar to edisa i have been

1809
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,920
working with him on the isg before

1810
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,839
i'm always fascinated because he seems

1811
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,439
to really all draft

1812
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,439
that come up in the ipf he's always on

1813
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,479
top of things

1814
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,560
he's always on top of things that happen

1815
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,679
in the ietf

1816
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,319
but also outside so he's he's been very

1817
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:38,880
active

1818
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,000
uh in in bringing topics and and

1819
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,520
uh and current um things that happen in

1820
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,198
the world to the iab

1821
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,040
in order to figure out if the ib needs

1822
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,839
to discuss it and needs to have a

1823
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:52,238
position um

1824
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:55,279
so um in order to replace that kind of

1825
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:55,679
uh

1826
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,359
service you provided i think we all on

1827
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,359
the on the new ib have to work together

1828
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:01,120
and replace them but you know stephen if

1829
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,960
you if you want to push an email to the

1830
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,719
iv from time to time make sure we're

1831
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,319
aware of the right things that

1832
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,279
still we still happily take that um but

1833
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:09,679
also

1834
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,520
besides that stephen has been very

1835
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,679
active on the iab he has created and

1836
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,839
shared the model t program

1837
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,359
um he has been active on the last

1838
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,520
workshop and we had last november

1839
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,279
and he's usually one of the persons who

1840
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,799
raises his hand if there's any kind of

1841
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,960
admin test that need to move forward

1842
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,000
the thanks a lot for that

1843
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,880
and mark actually has been kind of

1844
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,719
equally active i have to say mark has

1845
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:33,520
been on the ib

1846
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,439
since 2017. um he has been

1847
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,198
very active in the iab but i think he's

1848
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:41,759
also very active in in the in the ietf

1849
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,479
as a whole

1850
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,319
really tries to drive things forward

1851
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,560
really tries to make the internet better

1852
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,600
um and and also brought like in that

1853
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,000
sense his fuse into the iab

1854
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,679
and have been very active in the eye

1855
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,280
being in different position he was a

1856
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,640
member of arsoc

1857
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,920
um he has been the w3c liaison for a

1858
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:00,800
while and then

1859
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,440
um switched over in the shepherd role

1860
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,360
and he's also one of the persons who's

1861
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,280
kind of active in every decisions and

1862
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,520
and take up tasks if needed so um

1863
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,520
thanks for that part and thanks for

1864
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,960
engaging very actively

1865
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,360
and then jeff jeff together with mark

1866
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,080
and eliza

1867
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,400
and yari actually has been one of the

1868
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,520
has also been on the ib since 2017

1869
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,520
so as like three of those four people

1870
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,440
are stepping down

1871
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,000
uh and and like jeff was also one of the

1872
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:32,640
persons

1873
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,040
who was like bringing in kind of this

1874
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:35,760
knowledge

1875
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,560
from the from like the last four years

1876
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,840
and the experience

1877
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,480
and he was always a good person to ask

1878
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:42,880
um

1879
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,800
if if you need to know about something

1880
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,640
that has been a long-term activity on

1881
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,320
the iab or has been discussed in

1882
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:49,600
previous times

1883
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,280
so that's definitely something where we

1884
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,800
will miss him and and

1885
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,360
i think yari has to now pick up the

1886
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,560
remaining

1887
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,640
responsibilities here and step in for

1888
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,679
all of them

1889
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:03,520
so um again thank you all three of you

1890
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,440
um you might wonder now why there are

1891
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,440
these glasses on the slide

1892
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,679
and uh on the one hand this is a little

1893
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,600
bit of reminder that like the last year

1894
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,800
i think where

1895
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,679
was quite challenging for all of us but

1896
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:16,400
um

1897
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,159
on the iab i think it was also

1898
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:19,760
challenging especially for new iab

1899
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,560
members

1900
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,199
to get to know each other because we

1901
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,960
usually have those retreats or we also

1902
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,800
meet in person at other meetings

1903
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,239
where we really get to know each other a

1904
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,159
little bit better and it's it's

1905
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,320
part the retreats give us enough time to

1906
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,719
talk about technical stuff about topics

1907
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,000
that needs discussion

1908
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
but it has also really important role

1909
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,760
where everybody sits together and just

1910
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,560
gets to know

1911
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,719
each other better and we work together

1912
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,040
as a group and get to know each other

1913
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,640
so that was definitely missed out we

1914
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,400
tried to have some

1915
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,600
social involvement but

1916
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,760
i don't think that could replace it it

1917
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,320
fully so what we will do here is that

1918
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,280
all of you

1919
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,080
will get shipped some nicely iab branded

1920
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:00,800
glasses

1921
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,080
and the respective um

1922
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,960
liquid that fits into these glasses so

1923
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,880
at least you can at home have a little

1924
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,360
drink

1925
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,400
uh remember your good times on the iab

1926
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,600
uh and and cheer on on the iab time and

1927
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,920
then hopefully we all can have together

1928
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,760
a dream even so you might not be on the

1929
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:21,360
ib at that point where you will not be

1930
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,320
on here before

1931
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,400
at that point of time anymore i think we

1932
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,080
can hopefully all have a drink together

1933
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,480
when we're back in person somewhere

1934
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,520
so thanks a lot for all for for your

1935
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:37,840
participation in the ib

1936
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:47,440
great um so we also wanted to

1937
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,480
recognize our outgoing ihg

1938
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,880
members i'm going to recognize my my

1939
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,880
co-ads here first

1940
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,320
um so barry deborah and magnus

1941
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,199
they share the distinction i think if i

1942
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:01,920
have my

1943
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,199
information correct of each having

1944
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,560
served six years

1945
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,600
on the iesg which is

1946
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,760
uh a long time i can tell you from

1947
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:12,800
experience

1948
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:16,320
and they um were not all consecutive so

1949
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,040
barry and and magnus each served prior

1950
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,520
terms previously and then came back for

1951
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,080
a third term um magnus going back to

1952
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,920
2006 i think was when he

1953
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,040
um started his first term and barry um

1954
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,400
in 2012

1955
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,400
deborah served her six years um

1956
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,520
consecutively

1957
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,480
so a sort of different kind of glutton

1958
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,920
for punishment there

1959
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,400
but um just based on the the depth of

1960
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:41,840
that experience

1961
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,640
we will we will really be losing a lot

1962
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,679
with these three

1963
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:49,040
stepping off of the isg i think

1964
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,080
for for barry um this time around

1965
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,199
thinking about it barry and i were

1966
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,920
co-id's previously in the art area and

1967
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,600
thinking about the art area in the last

1968
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,960
couple of years it's been a little bit

1969
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,560
quieter than it was

1970
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,159
um maybe in the heyday but there were a

1971
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,000
few really significant milestones that

1972
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,880
very helped

1973
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,320
to shepherd peru the cap working group

1974
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,880
uh has completed the capper architecture

1975
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,120
and the catboard api

1976
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,320
not the easiest set of documents to

1977
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,320
to get through so that was pretty

1978
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,360
significant

1979
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,000
and then very recently barry also

1980
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,360
shepherded

1981
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,600
the process of taking rdap to internet

1982
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,719
standard

1983
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,560
as we all know there's not that many

1984
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,159
protocols that have gone to internet

1985
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:32,960
standard

1986
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,080
um so that's definitely something to

1987
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,520
to be celebrated debra has been

1988
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,320
our stalwart traffic engineering guru on

1989
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:43,360
the isg

1990
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,880
for a long time um in addition to all of

1991
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,600
that work she also had each of these ads

1992
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,320
really had their share of

1993
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,120
document suites that weren't the easiest

1994
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,560
to get through the process

1995
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,040
but they persevered and so for debra

1996
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,800
what i remember very clearly was the

1997
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,520
lisp

1998
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,360
documents um she shepherded updates to

1999
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,280
a suite of lisp documents

2000
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,159
in the last year or two and again that

2001
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:12,480
was

2002
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,800
that was a long process with lots of

2003
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,400
great feedback in particular from our

2004
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,080
friends in the security area

2005
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,719
um that that really made the the output

2006
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:22,000
much much better

2007
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,920
um and she's been uh uh overseeing

2008
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,000
all of the the deterministic networking

2009
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,600
uh work the detonate

2010
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,920
uh working group which has uh recently

2011
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,360
gotten a bunch of their documents

2012
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,719
approved and out the door

2013
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:39,040
uh really a major innovation um for uh

2014
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,360
performance guarantees in single

2015
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,480
networks so

2016
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,080
that's that's very exciting set of

2017
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,920
developments and then

2018
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,320
magnus um he already talked about quick

2019
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,239
uh i just have to say like

2020
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,760
you know there's there's an infinite

2021
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,520
number of jokes about when

2022
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,880
when quick was going to be finished or

2023
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,719
when quick v1 was going to be finished

2024
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,320
um and it you know the we kept saying

2025
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,520
it's going to it's going to be this year

2026
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,560
it's going to be that year and he kept

2027
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:03,600
getting pushed back

2028
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,440
but magnus did manage an impressive feat

2029
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,480
which was

2030
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,679
to basically land right on time for his

2031
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:12,719
own

2032
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:17,040
isg cycle it's always painful when

2033
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,920
big document suites kind of get left get

2034
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:22,080
passed on from one ad to another when

2035
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,040
they are

2036
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,040
that far along in the process that they

2037
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,880
are in isu review or they're entering

2038
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,400
ihg review and then you have a new

2039
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:29,600
person coming in

2040
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,960
um so super big kudos to magnus for

2041
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,280
pulling that off and actually getting

2042
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,080
the v1 document suite

2043
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,400
through the whole iesg process uh prior

2044
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,840
to stepping down

2045
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,840
there's there's a lot that goes into it

2046
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,280
and a lot that's out of your control

2047
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,239
as an ad so that's pretty impressive um

2048
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:48,960
and then just

2049
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,280
since you know highlighting a a more

2050
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,800
difficult set for everyone

2051
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:55,840
magnus also um oversaw

2052
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,520
updates to nfs again

2053
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,840
not the easiest one of those documents

2054
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,400
is 560 pages long

2055
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,800
and i think probably the longest

2056
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,000
document that

2057
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,760
has come through since i've been on the

2058
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,000
ihg for many years

2059
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,199
and and you can only imagine

2060
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,400
if you weren't on the inside of that

2061
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,480
process uh the

2062
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,640
the trickiness of trying to get at this

2063
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,880
document done at 560 pages

2064
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,080
so again very impressive and

2065
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,760
i know i will i will miss working with

2066
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:29,040
all of you and your presence will be

2067
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,719
missed on the ihg but

2068
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,880
i know that everyone will continue to

2069
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,920
see you

2070
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,440
in the community and contributing in

2071
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,239
different ways and so

2072
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:40,480
really thank you for your service i

2073
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,520
cannot speak to

2074
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,760
the censored icons on the slide so i

2075
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,880
will turn it over

2076
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,840
to lars for that

2077
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,199
all right thanks so much i hope you can

2078
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,320
hear me um

2079
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,480
yeah so so we snuck that on there uh to

2080
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,080
surprise you a little bit um so what

2081
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:56,719
this is

2082
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:58,400
it's a gift to the outgoing 80s if you

2083
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,920
can imagine and um

2084
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,760
we unfortunately can't show them not

2085
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,960
because they're censored but simply

2086
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,159
because they aren't ready so we're

2087
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,320
getting digital caricatures made

2088
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,239
uh that you can use as your avatar or

2089
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:09,600
you can like get them

2090
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,960
we actually gonna send you a framed

2091
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,960
version also um

2092
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,560
so so the participants should look out

2093
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,400
whether your data tracker picture

2094
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:16,960
changes

2095
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,600
uh soon um i think they're going to be

2096
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,360
great the artist unfortunately was a

2097
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,800
little overwhelmed and couldn't get them

2098
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,159
done in time

2099
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,520
so that's what that is in case you were

2100
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,280
wondering uh next slide please

2101
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:32,239
right so last i got on the incoming itf

2102
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:33,840
chair i want to spend yet some more time

2103
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,000
to praise alyssa so alyssa uh

2104
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
became the ninth chair of the itf in

2105
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
2017 as most of you probably

2106
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,840
know she served for two terms she was

2107
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,600
also our first female chair

2108
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,360
and before that she started from the a

2109
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,120
as an ad on the isg and

2110
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,120
she served on the iab and then during

2111
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,320
those four years and

2112
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,000
and overlapping with some of her time on

2113
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,880
those other bodies um she oversaw

2114
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,199
quite a few really important changes to

2115
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:58,719
the organization that had sort of

2116
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:00,480
internal and external impact

2117
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,080
so jason already talked about the whole

2118
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,560
isr 2.0 process and the establishment of

2119
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:05,760
the llc

2120
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,480
um and lister had a you know fundamental

2121
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,520
role here both

2122
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:13,520
uh as a member of the um

2123
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,960
iab and isg but also then as chair um

2124
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,920
and she also sort of helped

2125
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,840
significantly improve the the funding

2126
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,800
structure working with eyesock to

2127
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,800
align the funding stream from isoc to

2128
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,640
the ietf and

2129
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,719
stabilize that uh which is sort of

2130
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:30,560
setting us up for a

2131
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:32,960
hopefully much more comfortable future

2132
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,960
um on a technical side

2133
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,880
there's a lot of technical the important

2134
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,719
work that happened uh with her at the

2135
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:39,520
helm

2136
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,679
a lot of the post snowden security and

2137
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,679
privacy milestones that we worked on so

2138
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,120
tls 1.3

2139
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:49,520
the acme work dot and doh all happened

2140
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,880
under chairman womanship um

2141
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,400
magnus talked about some major

2142
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,000
evolutions to their websites such as

2143
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,840
quick there was also webrtc which is a

2144
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,360
similarly sized uh

2145
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,960
piece of work that was done while she

2146
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,800
was chair um

2147
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:05,360
and and the the struggle that's still

2148
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,679
ongoing of how itf working groups use

2149
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,480
github

2150
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,880
started uh uh under her chairwomanship

2151
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,080
and and then

2152
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,320
uh got sort of formalized into the two

2153
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,480
rfcs that we're now using to

2154
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,880
um you know blueprinters work a little

2155
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,920
bit better

2156
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,400
externally um alyssa was extremely um

2157
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,719
good there was a she played a key role

2158
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,560
in a successful transition of the ayana

2159
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:29,679
functions

2160
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:32,239
she chaired the icg the iona stewardship

2161
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,080
transition coordination group

2162
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,880
um she dealt with a lot of geopolitical

2163
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,840
consequences

2164
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,600
of the trump administration there were

2165
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,440
travel bans there were export

2166
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,560
restrictions that

2167
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,960
led to consequences for who could meet

2168
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,480
and who couldn't meet anymore

2169
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,320
in close doors that had a lot of

2170
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,600
standards bodies

2171
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,719
uh very worried for a while and then

2172
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,400
finally covet happened right right at

2173
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,199
the end of her second term and so

2174
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,159
she helped the organization through that

2175
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,520
entire experience which

2176
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,239
surely wasn't easy and throughout her

2177
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:04,800
service

2178
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,480
in the various itf leadership roles

2179
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,639
she's held and especially i think most

2180
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,000
recently as chairs what i

2181
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,760
most admired about alyssa was the

2182
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,440
dedication that she

2183
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,679
showed to the success of the itf and the

2184
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,960
success of the overall

2185
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,440
multi-stake holder model of the internet

2186
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:20,560
governance

2187
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:22,960
and and i think this is come through

2188
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,560
time and time again

2189
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,920
and i mentioned she separated the

2190
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:27,600
organization through some really

2191
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,080
significant

2192
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,880
internal external transitions um and i

2193
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,560
think that many of us will agree that

2194
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,080
she's put us on a course i think that

2195
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,600
will have a very positive momentum

2196
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,360
for for years to come and and i will

2197
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,440
certainly benefit from that i hope

2198
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,960
um and what i personally admire most

2199
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,560
about eliza is the clarity

2200
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,639
with which she communicates especially

2201
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:45,920
when she's in the spotlight

2202
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,000
and under pressure and and she

2203
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,320
continuously sought and found consensus

2204
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,760
even when very difficult decisions

2205
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:52,880
needed to be made

2206
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,920
i think that is you know upholding the

2207
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,239
core values of the organization

2208
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,000
then i can only hope to measure up to

2209
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,679
the example that she's been setting over

2210
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,280
the last few years

2211
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:04,639
and with that i want to pass it over to

2212
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:06,080
alyssa in case she wants to say if he

2213
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:10,960
works for us

2214
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,000
um well thank you thank you for those

2215
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,440
kind words um and and the praise it's um

2216
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,719
it's it's truly humbling i

2217
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:22,719
really just wanted to thank all of you

2218
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,880
actually um

2219
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,239
i think the internet is a marvelous

2220
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:29,360
invention

2221
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:32,080
and every day it still strikes me how

2222
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:32,800
it's

2223
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,120
changing the course of humanity

2224
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:36,400
basically

2225
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,040
and a lot of that comes down to all of

2226
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:39,679
you

2227
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,719
and the work that you've done uh the

2228
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,400
collaborations that you've had here

2229
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,280
in the ietf and the creations that

2230
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,800
you've put out into the world

2231
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,000
like it's totally breathtaking to try to

2232
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,719
stand back and take it all in

2233
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,239
so i am incredibly gratified to have had

2234
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,520
a little tiny opportunity to participate

2235
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:02,480
in that

2236
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,800
and try to affect a little bit of change

2237
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,440
here and there um but mostly i'm just

2238
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,760
humbled and honored to have been a part

2239
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,800
of this community

2240
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,320
and um to you know have been able to

2241
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,120
to play a role in the uh in the

2242
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,000
evolution and

2243
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,920
the history making of this thing that we

2244
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:21,120
call the internet

2245
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,600
um so thank you to everybody in the

2246
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,280
whole community for that

2247
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,120
um and to lars i wish you all the best

2248
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,199
i have complete confidence in your

2249
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,639
success and

2250
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:34,400
if you ever need to let off steam which

2251
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,760
i'm sure that you won't

2252
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,320
because nothing about this job requires

2253
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,679
the letting off of steam

2254
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:41,679
um i think that you you know how to

2255
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:42,800
reach me so

2256
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,080
thank you and i'll turn it back to you

2257
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,719
you and normally this would be the point

2258
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:52,000
where we all sort of get out of the

2259
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,360
chairs and give alissa

2260
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:55,280
a well-deserved round of applause which

2261
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,560
unfortunately coveted

2262
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,520
is robbing her out of that experience um

2263
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,239
so instead

2264
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:02,400
um since we really can't do this in any

2265
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,080
meaningful way i'd like to ask all of

2266
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,040
you as you're sitting here in the

2267
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,280
plenary typing away in the chat room

2268
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,040
um to maybe take a minute or two and

2269
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,719
sort of um send her an email

2270
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,560
but and thank her for her for her

2271
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,159
service and your words and maybe

2272
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:15,679
remember an anecdote that you

2273
01:24:15,679 --> 01:24:17,600
shared with her or send her a photo that

2274
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,120
you have and and you know

2275
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,199
um tell her yourself how you feel about

2276
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,040
her leadership in the last few years

2277
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:26,480
thank you alyssa um before i continue i

2278
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,360
sort of want to take a

2279
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,080
minute or so to introduce myself to you

2280
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,280
in case you haven't

2281
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,840

um i'm german i live in finland for the

2285
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,400
conspiracy theorists amongst you i live

2286
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,880
in the same small town as yari arco

2287
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,280
talk about coincidences i've been

2288
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,880
participating in the itf

2289
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:49,840
since year 2000 the 49th itf in san

2290
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:51,440
diego was my first one which was the

2291
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,880
biggest one

2292
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,560
also i was a phd student at uscisi

2293
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,920
at the time and was sent to the itf for

2294
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,040
the first time to

2295
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,679
present something related to ipsec um

2296
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:04,560
there was a

2297
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,199
research result out of isi and and what

2298
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,080
i most

2299
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,600
vividly remember about that entire

2300
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,120
meeting was that stephen kent

2301
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,480
did not like that presentation at all

2302
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,719
um i kept attending anyway eventually

2303
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,560
became working group share and transport

2304
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,360
and then

2305
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,080
ad of the transport area and and fun

2306
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:22,560
fact

2307
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,480
you can become an id even without ever

2308
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,320
having published an rfc on the i-test

2309
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,520
stream

2310
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,840
so uh in case you're worried about that

2311
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,760
if that's a qualification it's not

2312
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,719
um more recently i shared the irtf for a

2313
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:35,840
number of years and

2314
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,600
following that i shared the quick

2315
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,120
working group

2316
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,719
and as i get up to speed in sort of this

2317
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,320
new role um

2318
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,320
i'd like to invite the participants sort

2319
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,760
of to reach out to me

2320
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,080
email me or ask for a zoom meeting and

2321
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,440
uh let's chat about anything that's on

2322
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,199
your mind this is what we would normally

2323
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,880
do in the hallways or the bar

2324
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,120
which we can't do uh at least this

2325
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,000
meeting and

2326
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,480
possibly the next one um i'll also be in

2327
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,360
gather town

2328
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,600
so if you see me there um before or

2329
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,280

which i think we can go to the next one

2335
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,560
which is the passing of the dots uh so

2336
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,199

leds are off the hook

2339
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,320

2340
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,840
everything's transitioned over i know

2341

cindy in the background has been busy

2342
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,679
um operating at the data tracker so all

2343
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,040
of us have like 20 million

2344
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,920
inbox emails in their inbox informing us

2345
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,360
what has happened with various working

2346
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,280
groups and teams and so on

2347
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,280
um and as we stare those dots

2348
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:48,400
uh we're gonna open the microphone lines

2349
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,280
uh for the isg part of the open open mic

2350
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,080
next slide please

2351
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,520
so this is the um incoming and outgoing

2352
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,360
isg that are they're all still going to

2353
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,880
be here at least for the open mic

2354
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,080
part we have

2355
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:07,760
uh gotten some questions uh by email

2356
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,800
um i'm gonna read them

2357
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,120
in no particular order and uh we're

2358
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,719
gonna have some responses and then

2359
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:16,800
you guys are also free uh to ask

2360
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,400
questions um

2361
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,719
over the meat echo of course uh but

2362
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,159
let's start with those let's get started

2363
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,400
with those two we've gotten by email

2364
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,440
um and um uh since we didn't uh clarify

2365
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,560
uh whether we're gonna um um have these

2366
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,000
questions be anonymous or i'm not gonna

2367
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,639
mention who sent them in if the person

2368
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:35,679
who sent

2369
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,360
the question then would like to identify

2370
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,800
themselves in a chat or come to the

2371
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,600
microphone

2372
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,600
in response please do so but don't feel

2373
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,280
obligated to

2374
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,679
the first question says are you

2375
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:46,639
satisfied you

2376
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:49,120
isg satisfied there's a suitably robust

2377
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,199
procedure to ensure a clear separation

2378
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,120
of roles when a working group co-chair

2379
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,760
is a co-author of an internet draft

2380
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,840
just posting an email with a no hats

2381
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,480
disclaimer sometimes seems a little weak

2382
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:02,320
for instance when emails relate to

2383
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,679
progressing the document

2384
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:05,360
such as call for adoption consensus

2385
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,360
decisions working with class call and so

2386
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,080
on

2387
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,159
rather than the documents contents these

2388
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,920
potential conflict of interest

2389
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,400
issues sometimes arise at working group

2390
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,400
sessions too

2391
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,000
i think if i remember correctly barrier

2392
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
was going to speak to this uh

2393
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,040
question barry go ahead yes

2394
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,480
um hi i'm barry lieber and uh yes i i

2395
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:27,199
think we are

2396
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:30,239
satisfied in general the

2397
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:34,480
um the general thing of uh

2398
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,679
chairs having uh technical contributions

2399
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,360
in their working groups and we expect

2400
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,000
that

2401
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,639
and for that i think giving a no-hat

2402
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:43,360
statement

2403
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,560
is is adequate when a chair is an author

2404
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,760
on a document

2405
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,760
that's why we have co-chairs that's why

2406
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:52,239
we have responsible aeds

2407
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:54,000
and there's always somebody to take over

2408
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,639
the management of the document process

2409
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,040
so that the author the chair who's an

2410
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:00,639
author does not have to make the

2411
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,159
decisions on consensus and any further

2412
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:05,679
processing of the document

2413
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:08,880
so i think we're pretty good on that we

2414
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,480
have

2415
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,520
uh in in the iesg we've had a number of

2416
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,960
situations where an ad

2417
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,880
is an author on a document and asks a

2418
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,239
co-ad to

2419
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,000
handle the the processing of that

2420
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,920
document so in general

2421
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,400
we have a good uh a good system for

2422
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,840
handling this with all the

2423
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,679
different people with their

2424
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,840
responsibilities and their backups

2425
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:33,520
on that i think that's all i wanted to

2426
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,159
say about that

2427
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:37,600
hope that answers the question i'm gonna

2428
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,840
wait a few moments to see if there's a

2429
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,320
follow-up

2430
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,960
okay it doesn't seem to be the case then

2431
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,159
i'm going to move to the next question

2432
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:52,560
that we

2433
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,280
emailed which says having asked the

2434
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,120
questions a couple of sessions ago

2435
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,440
i just wanted to ask given increasing

2436
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,040
antitrust effort

2437
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,880
enforcement efforts including recent

2438
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,440
litigation are there any updates on the

2439
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,199
efforts to enhance the transparency of

2440
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:08,080
potential

2441
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,760
configurants within the itf status

2442
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,679
development or approval process

2443
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,080
rather than asking an open mic it seemed

2444
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,840
a question worth asking in advance for

2445
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,360
possible reaction at the session or

2446
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,520
elsewhere

2447
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,199
some similar transparency concerns are

2448
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,000
raised in draft going to diversity

2449
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,639
analysis.00

2450
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,560
and i think barry also volunteered to

2451
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,440
take this one for us

2452
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:34,159
yeah the uh the llc led this with uh

2453
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:36,159
setting up a conflict of interest policy

2454
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:37,840
for llc board members

2455
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,480
and the iab has since also done a

2456
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,480
conflict of interest policy

2457
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:45,360
uh disclosure policy and the iasg has

2458
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,360
been working on one for a while and is

2459
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,480
just about finished

2460
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:50,159
that you should see something public

2461
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,480
about that very soon

2462
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,520
um the disclosure policy specifies the

2463
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,199
conditions under which we are supposed

2464
01:30:57,199 --> 01:30:58,960
to disclose conflicts

2465
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,040
uh what sorts of conflicts we're talking

2466
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,480
about and

2467
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,639
i think that will increase transparency

2468
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:05,840
on that for

2469
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,360
a long time of course we've been

2470
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,600
disclosing who our affiliations

2471
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,320
are with and this goes a bit beyond that

2472
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:12,800
and

2473
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,520
expands on that so expect to see a

2474
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,360
conflict of interest policy uh

2475
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:21,040
officially from the iasg soon

2476
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:24,719
thanks and i'm again going to wait a few

2477
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,880
moments to see if there's a follow-up

2478
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,840
from the participants

2479
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,159
all right the third question we were

2480
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,800
sent uh was about what the plan for itf

2481
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:39,760
111 is and

2482
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,280
i think jason talked about this a little

2483
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,040
bit about pointing out that there's a

2484
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:44,400
consultation going on

2485
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,040
um but in any case this is mostly a

2486
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,040
question for the llc and for jay which

2487
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,639
is why we're punting it over to that

2488
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:51,199
open mic

2489
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,760
session and with that uh we come to the

2490
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,840
end of the questions we got uh by email

2491
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,840
um so if there's any questions from the

2492
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,520
audience now please get in line and we

2493
01:31:59,520 --> 01:31:59,840

2497
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,000
question in the chat in case it's hard

2498
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,040
to follow

2499
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,480

groups

2502
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,679
um moving work to github um

2503
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,440
and they're using it in different ways

2504
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,880
and often it strays

2505
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:31,840
so beyond uh the original sort of stated

2506
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,199
use of just

2507
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:35,440
using it for some purely editorial

2508
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,639
discussions

2509
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:38,320
um and it seems in some places that

2510
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,560
almost the entirety of the discussion

2511
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,159
the meaningful discussion at least is on

2512
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:43,840
github um

2513
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,080
with just the conclusions being posted

2514
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,000
back to the list

2515
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,199
which i think i would argue does exclude

2516
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:54,639
some potential contributors and

2517
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:57,920
can have quite a bad impact on diversity

2518
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,320
in the discussion and i wondered whether

2519
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,719
the icg leadership had any comments on

2520
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:04,480
this and whether

2521
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,520
more guidance is needed on the

2522
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,840
the appropriate use of github um thank

2523
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,000
you

2524
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,880
thanks yeah i i can speak to that since

2525
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,560
the quick working group is maybe

2526
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,560
the worst offender here in recent memory

2527
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,239
and i'm one of the chairs

2528
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:23,600
so um quick is really a very complex

2529
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:24,159
protocol

2530
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:26,480
and the short answer is that um i don't

2531
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,520
think we could have done

2532
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,199
quick if we hadn't used github in the

2533
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:30,960
way we we've been using it

2534
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,520
and we tried hard to not exclude anybody

2535
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:34,560
for example

2536
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,719
um we set up a second mailing list that

2537
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,320
was uh

2538
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,560
basically mirroring all the issue

2539
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,239
discussion and pr discussion that

2540
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:44,320
happened on github so every

2541
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,800
comment on the web elicited an email to

2542
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,639
that itf mailing list that people could

2543
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,000
then be subscribed to and

2544
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
follow along if they didn't feel they

2545
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,040
wanted to

2546
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,520
join github and it was also possible to

2547
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,159
reply

2548
01:33:56,159 --> 01:33:58,960
by email and have that reflected back

2549
01:33:58,960 --> 01:33:59,440
into

2550
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,560
the the github discussion effectively

2551
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,600
i don't think we've seen that

2552
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,520
been actually very much used i think i

2553
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,960
remember the top of my head like

2554
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,280
one or two participants that initially

2555
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,199
used the email feedback but then very

2556
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:14,159
quickly switched

2557
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:17,040
to github i obviously have no data about

2558
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:17,920
people who

2559
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,120
never reply to the email

2560
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,199
but i i simply think we could not have

2561
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,360
done this without a

2562
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,560
way to track issues that was allowing

2563
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,199
discussion and allowed us also to refer

2564
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,080
to

2565
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,040
the the text in the specification as

2566
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,960
part of the discussion in a way that

2567
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,520
didn't involve copying and pasting text

2568
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,560
um

2569
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,159
so that's i think some of that is

2570
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:44,480
reflected in in the rfcs that we have

2571
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,000
that talk about how working groups

2572
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,800
should use github um if if there's

2573
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,480
anything else that can be clarified

2574
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,239
there um i think we should do that since

2575
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:53,440
i don't think the

2576
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,040
use of github is going to decrease in

2577
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,520
the itf and magnus already mentioned in

2578
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:59,280
his section on quick that

2579
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,719
um how we're gonna be you know extend

2580
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:05,840
the github process into the isg and then

2581
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,920
the rfc editor phase of the document

2582
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,840
life cycle is an open question at the

2583
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:10,880
moment and we

2584
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,719
have one example where we did this with

2585
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,159
quick but but we don't know if that's

2586
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:16,000
the best way to do it

2587
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,320
um i think barry wants to speak to that

2588
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:20,880
too go ahead barry

2589
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,719
yeah i guess i'm talking a lot here but

2590
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,119
uh yeah i want to expand on one thing

2591
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:26,000
that andrew

2592
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,360
brought up was that if using git

2593
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,639
excludes some people

2594
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,159
um i i think over time the ia the ietf

2595
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:37,440
has to

2596
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,600
modernize its tools and move into

2597
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,440
different tools and this is an example

2598
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,119
of a situation like that where we are

2599
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:47,920
moving to some hybrid of email and

2600
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:48,880
github

2601
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:52,159
um and and we're just anybody can get a

2602
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:53,840
github account i think

2603
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,000
so i don't i don't think we are actively

2604
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,760
excluding anybody

2605
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,440
we will have a situation where some

2606
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,040
people are not comfortable with using

2607
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,080
github

2608
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,520
and that we've even seen that in the

2609
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,639
iesg as the quick documents come forward

2610
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:09,440
and the discussion between the iesg and

2611
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,119
the authors started happening

2612
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:12,880
in github and not all of us were

2613
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,639
comfortable with that

2614
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:16,719
i think the community is is going to

2615
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:18,239
have to move toward becoming more

2616
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,840
comfortable with that over time

2617
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,760
as more and more work moves into github

2618
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,840
and i don't think that's a bad thing

2619
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,480
thanks barry

2620
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,480
then go ahead

2621
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,560
yes so i i just wanted to also add to

2622
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,760
that you know we do have

2623
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,719
people using github for issue discussion

2624
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:45,600
but the text

2625
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,000
ultimately makes its way into the draft

2626
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,360
now we have lots of places that we can

2627
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,040
discuss drafts

2628
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:54,080
um and it's also

2629
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,560
not the case that github is sort of

2630
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,639
uniquely privileged in this regard

2631
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:00,800
people can be discussing the content of

2632
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:01,679
a draft

2633
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:04,639
in the bar or in design teams or in

2634
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,400
unicast email

2635
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,199
and so yes it is a way to have

2636
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,360
discussion that is not on the email list

2637
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:13,920
but we have lots of those as well

2638
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:17,760
and so this is this is change but it's

2639
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:18,159
not

2640
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:21,280
fundamental change and i think we have

2641
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,639
enough

2642
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,719
steps in the process where people can

2643
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:26,320
see what is happening

2644
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,400
and provide comments on it that it's not

2645
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,119
a foundational change

2646
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,360
so as barry says there's going to be

2647
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,960
some level of evolution

2648
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:37,760
and we can't stay fixed in our static

2649
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,080
ways

2650
01:37:43,199 --> 01:37:45,759
thanks ben

2651
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,639
i don't see any other responses from the

2652
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:50,000
isg so um

2653
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,280
let's move to the next question

2654
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:01,440
i don't see anybody in the queue at the

2655
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:05,119
moment andrew again go ahead

2656
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:06,239
well it is i thought i'd give something

2657
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,400
else a chance first

2658
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:11,280
but uh well let's see if this uh also

2659
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,159
provoked

2660
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:13,760
promise of response but thank you for

2661
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,520
your answers by the way um

2662
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:17,040
i think there's a discussion that's

2663
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,880
needed um

2664
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,719
a slightly different attack but but i

2665
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,159
guess also potentially

2666
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:24,880
just hitting on uh diversity in in the

2667
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,080
sense of

2668
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:27,600
allowing people to be involved if they

2669
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:30,159
wish there's an awful lot of work going

2670
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:30,639
on in

2671
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:33,520
interim meetings uh particularly since

2672
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:34,719
coved for

2673
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:37,600
obvious reasons um and there does seem

2674
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,119
to be a risk of shutting out

2675
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:42,400
so either people that are busy um or

2676
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,360
miss

2677
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:46,719
uh the the relevant mailing list post of

2678
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:50,080
uh uh interims um happening um

2679
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,800
or frankly just don't have the bandwidth

2680
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,840
um

2681
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:55,440
if some of the working groups are almost

2682
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,600
having bi-weekly interims

2683
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:01,679
which is quite a significant ask

2684
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,480
of people and there is a risk i think

2685
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,159
that that will really reduce

2686
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:08,239
the diversity of views just to those

2687
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:11,119
people whose sole focus

2688
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:14,239
is on the itf um and will exclude those

2689
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:15,760
that

2690
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,280
have other jobs uh to do uh

2691
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,920
so again does the uh sort of leadership

2692
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,480
have

2693
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,119
thoughts on maybe how to get more

2694
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,000
representation

2695
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,080
into interims um and or how to get

2696
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,320
the the important discussions happening

2697
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,520
um in the main

2698
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,480
ietf meetings uh to ensure there's a

2699
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,960
broader range of participation

2700
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,880
thank you and again i'll post that on

2701
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,719
the list in case that wasn't

2702
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,440
entirely clear

2703
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,679
andrew i think roman wants to respond to

2704
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:50,719
that one go ahead woman

2705
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:54,239
so great question i mean certainly the

2706
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,520
cadence of meetings

2707
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,000
uh can be challenging to include folks

2708
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,760
but i i don't think we have

2709
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,239
a new a new situation here in covit

2710
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:03,760
pre-covatons i mean there was the

2711
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:04,719
ability to have

2712
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,000
the cadence in the meetings uh cadence

2713
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,080
meetings at any any particular time as

2714
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,520
long as it follows processes

2715
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,800
i think that's really the thing we

2716
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,719
needed to be very cognizant of during

2717
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:15,520
cougar times

2718
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,840
as everyone became very comfortable with

2719
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,440
the the various kind of remote meetings

2720
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,520
that we kept to the practices of

2721
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,880
two weeks notice minutes as required

2722
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,280
so folks can follow up as required i

2723
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:29,199
will also say just anecdotally

2724
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:31,040
where i've seen working groups have

2725
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,800
frequent

2726
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,480
frequent interim meetings we actually

2727
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:36,159
see higher quality specs and we're

2728
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:37,360
talking more about it

2729
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,440
and we're getting documents pushed

2730
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,638
pushed at a faster pace

2731
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:50,719
um yeah go ahead

2732
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:52,800
yeah i also i wanted i want to mention

2733
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:54,159
because that's something we discussed in

2734
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,000
the isg but also the problem um

2735
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,159
we had any ib that of course dynamics a

2736
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,679
little bit different when you meet only

2737
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:00,560
online um

2738
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,199
and you have to manage your time and so

2739
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:04,639
i think it actually makes sense for

2740
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:05,600
working group shares and all

2741
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,360
participants too and to to

2742
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,199
rethink about how they want to use their

2743
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,440
meeting time i think it's actually very

2744
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,880
um uh good to see that in the interim's

2745
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,239
discussion is sometimes much more

2746
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:18,239
focused on specific issues while

2747
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:20,639
we use the planar meetings to have like

2748
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:23,199
more cross-area participation and so on

2749
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:26,400
i think we can do more in making sure

2750
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,719
that on the one hand we can use meeting

2751
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:30,560
her most efficiently and make progress

2752
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,440
on our work

2753
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,280
and why also have sync up times from

2754
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,719
time to time where we keep other people

2755
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,320
in the boat and work together

2756
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,080
so i think this is this is something

2757
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:40,320
where we um can learn from the current

2758
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:41,119
situation

2759
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,199
and we should reconsider and we should

2760
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:44,800
have also previously

2761
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,040
all been working on trying to improve

2762
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:50,320
how we use our meeting time

2763
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,080
and john wants to reply to john gomet

2764
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,880
um yeah i at the risk of being glib

2765
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,719
i will i will parody the question as um

2766
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:07,280
uh you know can everybody please stop

2767
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,880
working so hard it um

2768
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,639
it disadvantages people who don't have

2769
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:12,560
enough time to work that hard

2770
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,960
um on that on the working groups uh

2771
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,760
on the working groups work um which i

2772
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,040
expect is not really

2773
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,159
the intention um but

2774
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:27,760
at least uh interims i've participated

2775
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,080
in

2776
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,880
i i want to agree with maria that they

2777
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,000
um

2778
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,760
or at least what i think she said which

2779
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,639
is that they tend to have a more

2780
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:38,400
focused and interactive agenda which i

2781
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:41,280
think is a good thing not a bad thing

2782
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:43,119
if we are having adoramas where we're

2783
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:44,719
just reading slides at each other

2784
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,080
um then that's that's a negative but if

2785
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,400
we're having interims where

2786
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:53,600
actual work to move working groups

2787
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,280
forward is happening i

2788
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,199
i see that only as a positive thanks

2789
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,639
um let's go to the next person in line

2790
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:09,520
which is philip if you look go ahead

2791
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,560
yeah hi yeah

2792
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,719
i just wanted to follow up that and say

2793
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,080
i'm used to other

2794
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,679
standards organizations where the

2795
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,760
bi-weekly conference call

2796
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,880
is the usual way of doing things so

2797
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,440
i'm actually fully on board with this um

2798
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,840
more frequent interims thing i suspect

2799
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,280
that it's coming up

2800
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,920
because of covered it's changed a way in

2801
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,040
the which

2802
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,440
people are working however there are a

2803
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,119
couple of things that we

2804
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:42,320
should maybe think around that in that

2805
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,960
we should rethink the relationship of

2806
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,639
interims

2807
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:50,320
to the plenary meetings in that

2808
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,880
you know i've not been involved in quick

2809
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,119
and heb3 not because i didn't have

2810
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:57,119
anything to say but because

2811
01:43:57,119 --> 01:43:59,119
you know there's hundreds of other

2812
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:00,400
people trying to say

2813
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:03,360
stuff and so i said what i had to say

2814
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,880
and went away

2815
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:07,760
and you know i think that that's one way

2816
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:08,880
of interacting

2817
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,119
and you know you don't need to be a

2818
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,800
hundred percent

2819
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,760
engaged in a particular working group

2820
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:16,960
however

2821
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,880
maybe what we need to do is to rethink

2822
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:20,880
the way that we use plenaries

2823
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,480
so that instead of thinking of the

2824
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,239
plenary and the interim

2825
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:27,040
just being the same thing and interim

2826
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,000
being

2827
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:32,159
more akin to uh an editor's meeting

2828
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:35,360
in which the everybody who wants to

2829
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:38,159
can participate and you work the issues

2830
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,360
list

2831
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,480
and the plenary meetings being more

2832
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,480
outreach explaining yourself to the

2833
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,000
wider community

2834
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,920
explaining where you are where you're

2835
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,239
trying to do and the consequences

2836
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:52,960
of the design decisions made so the

2837
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,159
wider group

2838
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:56,800
can then say oh right yes you've decided

2839
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,199
to do

2840
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:00,000
this but that makes your protocol not

2841
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,040
work for

2842
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:03,920
green foots with souls and the other

2843
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:04,719
thing

2844
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,360
i'd say is that we really could do with

2845
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,320
some sort of

2846
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:11,600
tool that would aggregate information

2847
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,119
on when all these meetings are taking

2848
01:45:15,119 --> 01:45:16,080
place

2849
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,560
so that when i uh i'm planning out my

2850
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,040
calendar i can look in one place and see

2851
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,080
oh right the six uh interim

2852
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:28,320
meetings in the next uh three weeks

2853
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,000
uh these are the ones i'm really

2854
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,639
interested in i will schedule that time

2855
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:34,719
and i think that we could you know if we

2856
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:35,920
thought of this as an

2857
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,600
opportunity to rethink uh we can be more

2858
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,159
productive

2859
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,760
thank you phillip the one thing i want

2860
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,280
to quickly point out that there is

2861
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:45,760
actually

2862
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,480
the data tracker has an ical um

2863
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,159
subscription that it was

2864
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:52,880
subscribed to that has all the upcoming

2865
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,520
itf

2866
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,000
interim meetings um so you can you can

2867
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,679
at least see them in your calendar i

2868
01:45:57,679 --> 01:45:59,199
actually use that quite a bit

2869
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:01,119
um and then somebody probably has

2870
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:02,320
already put

2871
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:05,280
the url in the in the chat if not maybe

2872
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,320
somebody could do that so

2873
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,960
that's quite helpful um thank you let's

2874
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,639
go to the next person in the queue which

2875
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:13,840
is abu salam

2876
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:27,840
hello hi okay do you hear me

2877
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,719

yes go ahead uh mike uh

2879
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,280
actually it's a question and expectation

2880
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,239
also

2881
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:41,280
uh i'm expecting that from the directors

2882
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,119
of the areas let's say we have five

2883
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:44,400
areas uh

2884
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:47,199
uh and the directors to direct the

2885
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:48,480
working groups

2886
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,199
so i worked with some working groups or

2887
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:51,840
i had

2888
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,560
attended meetings and there are some

2889
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,239
documents or drafts

2890
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:59,360
while they get to uh the last call or

2891
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:00,400
the working group

2892
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:03,760
last call i'm expecting the director to

2893
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:07,040
okay to have let's say a meeting with

2894
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:10,080
with the chairs and direct that document

2895
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,440
it may be

2896
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,560
uh interacting with other working groups

2897
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:14,880
or

2898
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,840
other areas with as out of the area of

2899
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,440
the director

2900
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,320
and the same time i'm expecting to be

2901
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:23,040
feedback

2902
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:25,520
getting a feedback that this have been

2903
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:26,480
happened

2904
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:28,560
but if i don't know what's happening

2905
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,800
between the director and the chair

2906
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:35,199
how can i interact with other

2907
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:38,239
areas or working groups so i'm

2908
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:41,360
in one working group this is my interest

2909
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,760
and i'm expecting that there's some kind

2910
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:45,360
of interaction

2911
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,920
or some kind of information getting to

2912
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,639
me

2913
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,520
and also or a window or a channel i can

2914
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,080
go to

2915
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,199
it has this kind of drafts or

2916
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:57,360
documents which is in the working group

2917
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,639
last call

2918
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:02,000
and it's interacting with other areas or

2919
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,960
other working groups this way i will

2920
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,000
make sure

2921
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,280
i interact with these people or this

2922
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:12,400
working group participants to make the

2923
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,199
document

2924
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:17,600
more efficient for the ietf

2925
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,679
and it will be helpful also for the iesg

2926
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:25,440
when we are participating and giving our

2927
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,080
comments

2928
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,280
in short time and also in a more

2929
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,560
efficient way

2930
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,080
i was expecting that but and i didn't

2931
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:34,880
see that

2932
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:37,920
much in iet if maybe uh there is

2933
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,080
something i didn't know about but

2934
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,159
anyway this is number one and i will

2935
01:48:42,159 --> 01:48:43,199
hope in the

2936
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:46,719
next plenary meeting or the next meeting

2937
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:50,560
that this kind of iesg gave us a report

2938
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,159
which are the documents

2939
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:55,040
that had went through some kind of

2940
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,239
process which

2941
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:59,840
went to make it more efficient and more

2942
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:00,719
helpful

2943
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:03,679
for our areas because usually internet

2944
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:04,000
is

2945
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,679
uh is a technology that

2946
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:11,040
needs some kind of integration usually

2947
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:11,440
now

2948
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:14,159
technologies are more integrated so we

2949
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,920
have to focus on the

2950
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:18,480
the integration i remember that one

2951
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:19,679
participant

2952
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,719
uh i think jerry yeah he he was

2953
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:26,080
interested in the cross cross working

2954
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,440
group thing you know

2955
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:30,960
so i think it was proposed before and

2956
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:33,920
i don't know where this anyway this is

2957
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:34,320
my

2958
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,320
expect or my question you can say it's a

2959
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,000
question or expecting

2960
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,080
and i hope i get comments on that thank

2961
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,119
you very much

2962
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:42,719
thank you for your question i think eric

2963
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:45,920
wants to answer you

2964
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:53,199
indeed that's an interesting question of

2965
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:54,000
course

2966
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,400
and we should address this cross working

2967
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,679
group or cross

2968
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:01,199
arrears connection and reviews as early

2969
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:02,239
as possible

2970
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:05,280
and i must say a bit to my

2971
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,199
um not so comfortable thing with it

2972
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:12,239
does not always happen uh as the

2973
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:13,040
interior

2974
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,280
we see arriving document for instance

2975
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,280
about dns or about

2976
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,840
rpv6 that are lacking a lot of thing but

2977
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:21,840
we see it only in the atf last call so

2978
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,480
basically

2979
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,040
the earlier this cross area crossed

2980
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:25,840
working group

2981
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:28,639
is addressed the better we do agree now

2982
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:29,599
there is no real

2983
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:32,560
process on this it relies on the working

2984
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,840
group shares

2985
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:35,760
and for the working group chess in the

2986
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,280
participation here

2987
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,159
i remind that you can ask for an early

2988
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:40,960
review

2989
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:43,199
in all the directorates right for them

2990
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,480
the young doctors

2991
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,639
the iot directorates or whatever because

2992
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,320
you know the content

2993
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,880
of the draft and so you can address it

2994
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,800
to the different directorates and that

2995
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,480
will be helping a lot

2996
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:57,599
on the other end right so in the ing you

2997
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:58,880
also have

2998
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,880
informal telechart or from alternate

2999
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,040
chat where we can say hey

3000
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:06,239
this document is kind of linked to let's

3001
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:07,040
say quick

3002
01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:11,920
or to ipv6 or to dns or to whatever

3003
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,239
and then suggest to make another review

3004
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:16,639
a working group last call or specific

3005
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:19,119
last call review by specific working

3006
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:20,960
groups and again

3007
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,599
uh as i'm interested in ipv6 quite often

3008
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,679
six man is involved in this

3009
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,119
so yes it's relies on the human beings

3010
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:30,239
so it's imperfect

3011
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:32,400
but we it's really close to our heart as

3012
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:35,440
the lg for sure

3013
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:38,719
hope it helps thanks eric

3014
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:41,520
um next person in the queue is elliott i

3015
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:44,159
did go ahead

3016
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:48,559
the wrong button there lars

3017
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,320
first thanks for the opportunity to

3018
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,480
speak i want to come back to the

3019
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,119
discussion that andrew started about the

3020
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:57,440
use of interims

3021
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,080
so i'm chairing the rfc editor future

3022
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,520
program

3023
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:05,040
group which is an iab

3024
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,719
program activity but we're running it as

3025
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,040
a working group

3026
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:12,159
this is a highly contentious

3027
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,960
topic as people know but we've made i

3028
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:16,080
think great strides

3029
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:18,719
in the group um the the all the members

3030
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:19,920
should be really proud

3031
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,560
in terms of just how far the group has

3032
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:23,760
come

3033
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:27,440
uh in this regard um i don't think we

3034
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:28,560
could have done that

3035
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:31,440
without interims it took a long time for

3036
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:32,960
us to level set

3037
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,840
uh our our views it took a long time i

3038
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,520
think for people to

3039
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,119
to find ways to find common ground and

3040
01:52:41,119 --> 01:52:44,960
um having that quote face time

3041
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,239
if you will uh had has really helped us

3042
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,880
uh we did have to come to consensus i

3043
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:51,679
think

3044
01:52:51,679 --> 01:52:54,560
on how often to meet uh i i wanted to

3045
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:56,239
push for two weeks people thought that

3046
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:56,719
was

3047
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:59,440
a little too much for this topic and

3048
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:00,480
they needed time to

3049
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,520
to digest and to to consider and

3050
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,719
of course there are other things going

3051
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:06,320
on in the world especially this past

3052
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:07,360
year

3053
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:10,239
the one the two aspects rather that i'd

3054
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:10,960
like to bring

3055
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,159
bring forth though is that i think the

3056
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:14,239
group was hampered a little bit

3057
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:15,679
by the fact that we couldn't meet in

3058
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:17,360
person uh

3059
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,599
in that uh sometimes uh when you have

3060
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:21,440
contentious issues it helps

3061
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:24,560
uh to break up the with a beer in

3062
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,960
between if you will or coffee if you'd

3063
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:27,840
rather

3064
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,320
um the the other point i was going to

3065
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,040
make is

3066
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,199
that the interim activities i think have

3067
01:53:33,199 --> 01:53:34,800
actually opened up

3068
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:37,920
uh the um the the group

3069
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,440
uh to people who might not have

3070
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,960
otherwise participated

3071
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,360
uh simply because uh they couldn't

3072
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:44,000
travel

3073
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,320
um in to the meetings that we might have

3074
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:47,840
otherwise had we might have considered

3075
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:49,040
having an interim

3076
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,000
uh had we uh having the opportunity uh

3077
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:52,560
so this

3078
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,320
of course directly relates uh to the

3079
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,920
discussion that's going on the gen

3080
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,880
gen dispatch in terms of how is it that

3081
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,159
we're inclusive

3082
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:02,560
and i i don't claim that there is a

3083
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:03,360
single

3084
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:07,119
um recipe here but uh maybe other groups

3085
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:08,320
work differently they don't need those

3086
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:09,760
interims quite as much because you can

3087
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:11,599
just do work in email because it's

3088
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:13,520
you know very there's a nice synergy

3089
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:14,560
everybody's pushing in the same

3090
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:15,360
direction

3091
01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:16,880
but if you do have contention it really

3092
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:19,360
does help to have people talk it out

3093
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:23,360
thanks very much

3094
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,000
thanks for the input elliot um next in

3095
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:26,800
the queue is jim

3096
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,440
jim go ahead

3097
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:34,800
okay hi uh thanks uh i'd like to go back

3098
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:37,280
to the topic of github for a minute

3099
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:41,760
um so there's rfc 8874 and 88.75 which

3100
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:42,239
are great

3101
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:45,119
and tell working groups how to use

3102
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:46,000
github and

3103
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,639
thanks to the secretariat for reminding

3104
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,880
the chairs of that recently

3105
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,239
uh but there's also a github

3106
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:54,880
organization that's just called ietf

3107
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,520
and there's several repositories there

3108
01:54:57,520 --> 01:54:58,400
and

3109
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,480
uh i have a couple concerns there one is

3110
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,520
that it's

3111
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,119
not clear what the status of those

3112
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:05,199
documents are just the fact that the

3113
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,520
repository that the organization is

3114
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,040
called ietf

3115
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:11,280
kind of makes it seem like they might

3116
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,199
have some official status

3117
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:16,320
more so than others and uh that needs to

3118
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:16,719
be

3119
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:18,960
made clear at least in the individual

3120
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:20,159
repositories

3121
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:22,719
i also don't see that the note well is

3122
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:23,760
um

3123
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:26,560
consistently uh displayed and so forth

3124
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,360
there

3125
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:32,000
and uh so i'd like to kind of ask that

3126
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,719
uh we get some clarification on how

3127
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:36,639
that's used what it's used for

3128
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:39,360
and that we uh that we have all of those

3129
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:41,440
usual processes in place to make sure

3130
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,000
that

3131
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,719
contributions are appropriate and that

3132
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:45,040
the

3133
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,760
the status of documents there uh

3134
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,679
generally not representing iatf

3135
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:50,719
consensus

3136
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,679
is clear thanks

3137
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:57,520
so i think one part of your question is

3138
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,080
specifically about the github.com ietf

3139
01:56:00,080 --> 01:56:02,480
organization we're actually

3140
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:03,760
recently sort of started in the

3141
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:07,440
background um a little activity to

3142
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,679
bring that use under a little bit more

3143
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:11,520
rigor in terms of making sure that

3144
01:56:11,520 --> 01:56:15,040
repositories satisfy a certain

3145
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:16,960
you know rough set of criteria like

3146
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:18,080
they're like of

3147
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:20,480
broad organizational applicability and

3148
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:21,760
that they have descriptions

3149
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,320
and they have websites and and you know

3150
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,400
the notebook is displayed and so on

3151
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,000
this is sort of an ongoing process that

3152
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,159
i started and it takes a little

3153
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:32,159
bit of time because some of those

3154
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:33,280
repositories

3155
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,199
need to migrate outside of the

3156
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:36,560
organization

3157
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,040
um but some of them belong to documents

3158
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,480
into working groups that that

3159
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:41,760
you know where that would be a little

3160
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:43,040
bit disruptive so this is this is

3161
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:44,400
ongoing

3162
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:47,280
um the second part of your question i

3163
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:48,480
think it's a little bit more about the

3164
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,000
broader use of github and i think we

3165
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:50,800
talked about this

3166
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,360
uh already that um we we have the two

3167
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,599
rfc's you mentioned that that

3168
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:57,119
give us some guidance on what we should

3169
01:56:57,119 --> 01:56:59,280
be doing but i don't think they're the

3170
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,119
end state i think they're sort of a good

3171
01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:03,440
start that um give us some some rules

3172
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,080
that have

3173
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,320
proven to work well but i think we will

3174
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,599
need additional guidance

3175
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:09,360
on how we're gonna use get up even

3176
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:12,239
better in the future

3177
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:18,239
right um tortoise is next and i'm going

3178
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:19,920
to cut the

3179
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,080
mic line after him since we have some

3180
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,360
other open mics to get to

3181
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,679
well let's go ahead yeah and uh not sure

3182
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,840
if this is the right open mic but uh let

3183
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,520
me quickly propose something

3184
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:32,400
you know to uh to the organization and

3185
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:32,960
maybe the

3186
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,960
the isg would be the best one to drive

3187
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,400
it in terms of

3188
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,080
you know looking back and celebrating

3189
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,480
the organization by uh you know

3190
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,679
around itf 112 think about you know

3191
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:45,599
setting up a one day workshop

3192
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:47,520
uh to bring in you know the people we

3193
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:48,719
may not have

3194
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:51,920
any more in 10 years to basically give

3195
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:54,159
presentations you know maybe 20 minutes

3196
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:55,360
each uh

3197
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,280
about you know the core technologies and

3198
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,119
things that happened um you know

3199
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:02,320
um in in the organization

3200
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,880
and at that time and if it's not clear

3201
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:06,880
what the opportunity is then look at the

3202
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,159
publishing date of rfc 791 which to me

3203
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:12,239
you know for the ietf would be the best

3204
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:14,400
opportunity to celebrate something and

3205
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,000
as i said right in

3206
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,639
it's 40 years and in 10 years more we'll

3207
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:19,760
we won't have a lot

3208
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:23,520
of of the people who started it

3209
01:58:24,239 --> 01:58:26,400
that's a good suggestion and i i agree

3210
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,400
that it's unclear whether it's an isg

3211
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,480
um activity there's probably also an iap

3212
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,400
angle to it

3213
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,440
but um we'll we'll take that up

3214
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:38,320
um keep in mind that idf 112 might also

3215
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:38,639
be

3216
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:40,239
the first one we've had in a while that

3217
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:42,320
is going to be uh hopefully a physical

3218
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:43,920
meeting again so there might be some

3219
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,360
already some additional complexities

3220
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:47,520
with organizing that so we'll see what

3221
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:48,639
we can do

3222
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:51,760
um i am i think i want to sort of

3223
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,520
uh take the action item and we're going

3224
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,360
to maybe start an email thread about

3225
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:55,679
what

3226
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:57,840
people would volunteer to help organize

3227
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:58,719
and we can

3228
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,119
take it from there yeah i think that

3229
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:03,440
maybe if it's before ietf and would be

3230
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:04,880
virtual i think there would be a lot of

3231
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:06,080
people worldwide to

3232
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:09,199
you know join in on on on a video um you

3233
01:59:09,199 --> 01:59:10,880
know live stream of that right so it's

3234
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,560
certainly something that's for much

3235
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:13,360
broader

3236
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,199
community of interest than the ones who

3237
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:18,800
made it happen like the itf itself

3238
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,239
that's a fair point and we should

3239
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,960
discuss uh maybe if you care to start an

3240
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:24,880
email for example to the itf manager we

3241
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,000
can discuss something

3242
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,840
what format attacks is not quite clear

3243
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,360
whether it for example would need to be

3244
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:32,080
um you know in the itf week or whether

3245
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:32,400
we

3246
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:34,080
actually do a separate event at some

3247
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,920
other time and have a smaller

3248
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,239
like itf focused event during the

3249
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:39,040
meeting week

3250
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,880
for what we do yeah i think it's just

3251
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,159
september right so it's

3252
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:46,400
it's it's it would be a nice match right

3253
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,480
thank you and uh with that i think the

3254
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,599
isg open mic

3255
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:52,719
is uh at its end let's move on to the

3256
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:57,960
next one

3257
01:59:57,960 --> 01:59:59,040
[Music]

3258
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:02,719
yes uh once more hello um so we didn't

3259
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:06,480
um get any uh free questions to the open

3260
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:06,960
mic

3261
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:08,880
uh to be honest i also didn't ask

3262
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,199
explicit fully for it but like um

3263
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:12,960
as always you can always send emails to

3264
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,400
iab iv.org

3265
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:16,000
to me personally if you want to know

3266
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:17,599
something but now we're here for the

3267
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:18,639
open mic so

3268
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:22,239
um please join the queue and ask

3269
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:27,840
questions

3270
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:37,840
we have andrew apologies i was

3271
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,119
desperately hoping that somebody else

3272
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:40,159
might

3273
02:00:40,159 --> 02:00:41,760
like go first but then i didn't want you

3274
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,400
to decide there weren't any and move on

3275
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:47,520
and miss the opportunity um

3276
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:51,520
so i've got a question related to

3277
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:55,040
when some new standards are proposed um

3278
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,159
i i wonder whether um

3279
02:00:58,159 --> 02:01:00,239
now's the time to start assessing them

3280
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:01,760
for their so

3281
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:05,360
the potential to really uh exacerbate

3282
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:08,719
the current trend uh towards century

3283
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:10,000
centralization

3284
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,880
uh rather like that there's already some

3285
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:14,159
external input

3286
02:01:14,159 --> 02:01:17,839
uh on the security aspects

3287
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:19,360
which doesn't mean to say that proposals

3288
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:21,360
shouldn't go forward if there are

3289
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:23,520
uh certain consequences on

3290
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,520
centralization but at least

3291
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:27,119
the trade-offs will be would have been

3292
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:28,880
considered um and

3293
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,239
uh documented um because in my view

3294
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:35,119
the current driftward centralization is

3295
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:36,719
highly unlikely to be in the long term

3296
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:38,239
interests of end users

3297
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:41,920
um so contrary to rfc

3298
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:45,920
8890 um and therefore i think it really

3299
02:01:45,920 --> 02:01:47,520
shouldn't be made worse

3300
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,719
um as more new standards uh are brought

3301
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:51,599
on

3302
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:53,679
and i wondered whether the iab

3303
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:55,520
leadership had any views on this and

3304
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,199
whether you think action

3305
02:01:57,199 --> 02:02:00,159
is indeed needed and now's a good time

3306
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:01,040
to start

3307
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:05,840
thank you

3308
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:09,520
i'm just waiting a second to see yari is

3309
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:11,040
joining the queue so yeah you can just

3310
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:13,599
unmute him

3311
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:18,400
yeah good question thank you and um

3312
02:02:18,400 --> 02:02:20,719
i think there's going to be different

3313
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:22,320
differing opinions on this

3314
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:26,000
in the iab and as well as the iit if i

3315
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,840
personally do believe that that's a it's

3316
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,679
a big issue and we should be concerned

3317
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:30,320
about that

3318
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,719
and uh i think some of the discussions

3319
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:34,320
we've been having in some working groups

3320
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:35,199
are

3321
02:02:35,199 --> 02:02:38,000
are actually about that to some extent

3322
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:38,320
uh

3323
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:41,040
of course that's not the only only issue

3324
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:42,000
in front of us

3325
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,159
um i should also mention that the iab

3326
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:47,599
has promised to

3327
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:50,080
write or return to the topic of

3328
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,639
consolidation and centralization

3329
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:55,920
and write the document maybe

3330
02:02:55,920 --> 02:02:58,320
people have requested that the token is

3331
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,400
on me and i have failed to deliver so

3332
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,199
far

3333
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:04,560
but it's still on the task list so um

3334
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:05,920
that is something that that we are

3335
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:08,400
looking at

3336
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,960
yeah definitely i just want to ask

3337
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:13,599
because i wasn't sure andrew what we

3338
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:14,880
proposing or having your mind or

3339
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:17,119
whatever but um we definitely talk about

3340
02:03:17,119 --> 02:03:19,760
this from an architectural point of view

3341
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:22,320
and we try to as always we try to

3342
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:23,920
understand what the issues are provide

3343
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,080
guidance to the community and hopefully

3344
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,400
see an update and of yaris draft there

3345
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:30,480
very soon and keep the discussion going

3346
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,320
but then i'm not sure if you ask for

3347
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,480
actually kind of process changes

3348
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,239
i think if that should actually impact

3349
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:37,840
process that's definitely also a

3350
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:38,639
question for the

3351
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:42,800
for the um isg and and see how this is

3352
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:47,040
taking up and we have west there as well

3353
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:52,960
thanks and and man yep here we go

3354
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,960
thanks uh good question that's certainly

3355
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:56,000
a topic that has been

3356
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,159
hop very hot on my mind in fact on my

3357
02:03:58,159 --> 02:03:59,840
whiteboard behind me i have a list of

3358
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:00,480
different ways

3359
02:04:00,480 --> 02:04:01,920
the internet is centralized because i've

3360
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,000
been thinking about it for a while

3361
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,119
um the one thing that i've learned a lot

3362
02:04:07,119 --> 02:04:08,320
in the last couple of years thinking

3363
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,040
about it though

3364
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,880
is that it's very much a trade-off it's

3365
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,440
not just that centralization is all bad

3366
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:16,320
i personally don't use many centralized

3367
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,239
services because i think it's bad for me

3368
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:19,760
but the other thing you have to

3369
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,440
recognize is it actually enabled a lot

3370
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:21,760
of

3371
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:24,159
very strong usage of the internet that

3372
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:26,079
wouldn't exist today without it

3373
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:28,400
centralized file sharing services and

3374
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:30,320
centralized easy to create

3375
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,079
web management you know web pages and

3376
02:04:32,079 --> 02:04:33,840
things like that end up in very very

3377
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:35,040
centralized

3378
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:36,880
services which is which is greatly

3379
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:38,239
benefited users

3380
02:04:38,239 --> 02:04:40,719
as well as in a recent academic paper i

3381
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:42,000
co-authored

3382
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,239
we actually measured ways where security

3383
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:46,400
was suddenly fixed for a large quantity

3384
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,480
of users because the centralized service

3385
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:49,520
you know fixed some

3386
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:52,480
pretty severe security bugs and it

3387
02:04:52,480 --> 02:04:54,400
actually or you know deployed dns

3388
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,880
or didn't you know deployed https

3389
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,560
everywhere on all of their sites all at

3390
02:04:58,560 --> 02:04:59,280
once so

3391
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:02,239
uh it's a big trade-off issue um and

3392
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:04,320
centralization is a huge risk to privacy

3393
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:05,679
though so you have to balance all of

3394
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:06,719
those so the

3395
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:10,320
the the thinking is long and arduous so

3396
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:14,719
thank you thanks mark

3397
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:23,840
hello um yeah i'm i'm concerned about

3398
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:26,880
centralization as well um i

3399
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:29,520
i do get concerned that you know if we

3400
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,360
have a bar for centralization or some

3401
02:05:31,360 --> 02:05:32,719
other measure like that

3402
02:05:32,719 --> 02:05:34,800
you know effectively we would never have

3403
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,800
standardized the web because the web is

3404
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:37,679
to be seen as just

3405
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:39,280
a big engine for centralization to be

3406
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:41,199
honest because of the dynamics of how it

3407
02:05:41,199 --> 02:05:42,320
it works

3408
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:45,520
um i am interested in in more

3409
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,560
concrete kind of measures uh especially

3410
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:48,880
we

3411
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:50,639
uh brian tram and i have a draft that

3412
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:52,960
we've been living language for too long

3413
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:54,560
about checkpoints in the internet

3414
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,560
architecture and how we can

3415
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:58,159
prevent their formation and i think

3416
02:05:58,159 --> 02:05:59,760
that's a concrete thing these community

3417
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:00,960
can look at is

3418
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,800
where does this centralize power so much

3419
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,800
that it gives someone

3420
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:08,079
inordinate power over uh people's

3421
02:06:08,079 --> 02:06:10,159
experience of the internet but but

3422
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:11,520
having said that

3423
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:14,320
i think we also need to recognize that

3424
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:15,679
technical

3425
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:17,679
limits on centralization are often not

3426
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:18,719
going to be effective

3427
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:21,440
and competition law ones may be and we

3428
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:22,639
should be looking to

3429
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:24,639
work with the folks who are looking into

3430
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:25,920
that now uh

3431
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:27,599
and then giving them good technical

3432
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:31,840
advice where we can

3433
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:39,280
um maybe i think tommy you want to

3434
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,280
probably reply here as well so maybe i

3435
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:45,840
take tommy first

3436
02:06:49,920 --> 02:06:52,239
yeah so just on this topic i'd also like

3437
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:54,079
to chime in that

3438
02:06:54,079 --> 02:06:56,000
i think the centralization concerns that

3439
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:57,199
people bring up

3440
02:06:57,199 --> 02:07:00,239
often times are

3441
02:07:00,239 --> 02:07:03,280
kind of pointing at certain protocols

3442
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,760
that in and of themselves are not

3443
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:07,520
fundamentally related to

3444
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:10,000
being centralized or not i think andrew

3445
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,360
i know we've had these discussions

3446
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:12,480
around

3447
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,560
the use of dns and encrypted dns and

3448
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:15,679
dough and i think those are often

3449
02:07:15,679 --> 02:07:17,360
pointed at

3450
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:19,280
fundamentally these pieces of technology

3451
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:20,880
are not

3452
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,800
necessary necessarily

3453
02:07:24,960 --> 02:07:26,639
centralized but it's the kind of the

3454
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,280
market in the deployment models um

3455
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,119
i think as far as what is it appropriate

3456
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:34,639
for iab to do or the isg to do

3457
02:07:34,639 --> 02:07:35,840
i don't think we're going to be able to

3458
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:38,159
say you know thou shall not have

3459
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:39,119
centralization

3460
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:43,280
and probably what is more useful is to

3461
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,679
point out the areas

3462
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:47,670
where we can

3463
02:07:47,670 --> 02:07:48,719
[Music]

3464
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:52,159
provide mechanisms and technical

3465
02:07:52,159 --> 02:07:54,239
solutions to help

3466
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:56,239
decentralize things to help make it

3467
02:07:56,239 --> 02:07:59,040
viable to have a non-centralized model

3468
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:03,280
um and let's not focus on

3469
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:05,199
you know demonizing any technologies

3470
02:08:05,199 --> 02:08:06,400
that happen to be

3471
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,079
having to work well with centralized

3472
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,159
models and decentralized models let's

3473
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:11,440
focus on

3474
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:13,679
what are the missing pieces that make it

3475
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:15,440
hard to create

3476
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:18,560
generic decentralized solutions um

3477
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,360
so it's more of a call to action than a

3478
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,880
call to stop working on things

3479
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,880
very good point um so with that i think

3480
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:29,760
we move on to

3481
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:33,360
philip hi yeah i'd like to

3482
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:35,599
address this and kind of recast it a

3483
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:36,960
little bit

3484
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:40,320
in that if you obsess about

3485
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,639
don't just look at centralization look

3486
02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:44,079
about the driver

3487
02:08:44,079 --> 02:08:46,560
for centralization which is that the

3488
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,000
user doesn't have

3489
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,599
autonomy i cannot change my email

3490
02:08:51,599 --> 02:08:52,800
provider

3491
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:56,159
because if i do my email account

3492
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:58,560
address will change and the stuff will

3493
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:00,239
be going to a different place

3494
02:09:00,239 --> 02:09:02,480
so of course you know i own my own

3495
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:03,760
domain name

3496
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,159
because that's the only way that i can

3497
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:07,679
earn my account

3498
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:09,520
but that cost me ten dollars a year

3499
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,400
which is a significant fraction

3500
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:16,000
of many people's annual incomes and

3501
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,079
you know maintaining a domain name is a

3502
02:09:18,079 --> 02:09:19,360
significant

3503
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:22,880
uh technical barrier for many people

3504
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:24,880
a lot of the times when i see people

3505
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:26,000
trying to design

3506
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,199
systems that are decentralized they

3507
02:09:29,199 --> 02:09:30,000
obsess

3508
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,280
about the decentralization piece and

3509
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:36,520
eliminating any possibility of

3510
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:40,560
centralization imposing enormous

3511
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:43,679
cost on that design and extreme there

3512
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:46,079
of course is blockchain current

3513
02:09:46,079 --> 02:09:47,599
currently consuming

3514
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:50,560
as much electricity as the entire nation

3515
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:53,360
of argentina

3516
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:56,000
and so what i i'd urge people to look at

3517
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,880
is

3518
02:09:56,880 --> 02:10:00,400
how do we give the user the ability

3519
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:04,320
to own their own account so that

3520
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:07,760
they can have a lifelong email address

3521
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:10,719
that they can take to one provider to an

3522
02:10:10,719 --> 02:10:11,040
at

3523
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:14,239
to another that follows them around

3524
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:18,400
so that they can switch without

3525
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:21,520
incurring a penalty and if you provide

3526
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:25,040
that capability i can also switch my

3527
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:27,920
social media account around so that

3528
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:29,040
instead of being

3529
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:31,199
forced into the same network that

3530
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:32,400
everybody else is

3531
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,239
i can go somewhere else so i'll be

3532
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:36,320
making a proposal in that area in the

3533
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,079
near future

3534
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:41,679
it's it's not decentralized

3535
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:45,679
but what i'm trying to do is to shrink

3536
02:10:45,679 --> 02:10:48,320
the border of the centralized piece to

3537
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:50,480
the absolute bare minimum

3538
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:54,480
and then create a infrastructure around

3539
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,000
that that makes that public

3540
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:59,520
goods uh in the way that we try to do

3541
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:03,199
with icann and completely fail

3542
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:04,880
thanks uh looking forward to that

3543
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,480
proposal but that might be actually more

3544
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:07,280
interesting for

3545
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:09,679
um the ia the ietf as a whole and for

3546
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:11,840
the ib but we also have the ib open

3547
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:12,639
meeting

3548
02:11:12,639 --> 02:11:14,079
tomorrow where we can have more of these

3549
02:11:14,079 --> 02:11:15,840
technical discussions if needed

3550
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,719
and then dominique

3551
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,800
yeah i'm hoping we can pick this up a

3552
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:22,880
bit more tomorrow in detail

3553
02:11:22,880 --> 02:11:24,960
i just wanted to say that this is

3554
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:26,719
definitely it sounds like a call to

3555
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:27,760
action and

3556
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,480
and it's not about demonizing like one

3557
02:11:30,480 --> 02:11:31,440
technology or

3558
02:11:31,440 --> 02:11:33,760
the other but it's about list listing

3559
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,520
the problem space right and all the

3560
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:37,520
different issues that are coming up

3561
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:40,639
um which i've started to do with um both

3562
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:41,119
mark and

3563
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:42,960
elliot and i have a draft on

3564
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:44,880
consolidation that i can point

3565
02:11:44,880 --> 02:11:47,760
everyone to um but yeah let's definitely

3566
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:49,119
continue to talk about it because i

3567
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:50,480
think that there's quite a lot of

3568
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,040
interest

3569
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:53,599
so i am looking forward to tomorrow

3570
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:54,719
thanks

3571
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:59,040
thank you and yuri

3572
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:02,400
yeah on the side philip and dominic if

3573
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:03,760
you can put your hand down

3574
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,040
and leave the queue that will be helpful

3575
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:07,280
thanks

3576
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,360
yeah thank you um there's a lot of wise

3577
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:10,639
things said by many people

3578
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:13,119
um i want to pick up on something that

3579
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:14,639
tommy actually said i think that that

3580
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:16,079
was the

3581
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:19,199
essential piece that it's it's not

3582
02:12:19,199 --> 02:12:21,440
not that we need to sort of ban some

3583
02:12:21,440 --> 02:12:22,400
things but find

3584
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:24,320
find the missing pieces and and work on

3585
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,520
that

3586
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,599
uh i think that's exactly right and this

3587
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:29,520
is not about like extremes like a lot of

3588
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,599
people bring these examples but we can't

3589
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:32,000
have

3590
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:35,119
you know the web or we can't have you

3591
02:12:35,119 --> 02:12:37,119
know or we shouldn't have the

3592
02:12:37,119 --> 02:12:39,840
uh the bitcoin architecture or you know

3593
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:40,560
kind of like

3594
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,760
um extreme ends of the spectrum

3595
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,920
but but it really is about sort of

3596
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:48,000
choice that you have like the situations

3597
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,119
where

3598
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:50,960
you know something works well you know

3599
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:52,560
if you configure one ip address

3600
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:53,199
somewhere

3601
02:12:53,199 --> 02:12:55,520
or one one name name somewhere that

3602
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,040
doesn't have like discovery mechanisms

3603
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,400
and tommy for instance has worked on

3604
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:58,800
some

3605
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:01,360
some discovery mechanisms before some

3606
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:02,079
some protocol

3607
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:03,599
cases so i think those are the kinds of

3608
02:13:03,599 --> 02:13:05,840
things that actually help us and

3609
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:08,400
and uh dominique was of course also

3610
02:13:08,400 --> 02:13:09,040
right that

3611
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:11,679
uh documenting the issues is a key and

3612
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:13,520
understanding it's like

3613
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:15,440
um sort of this pervasive surveillance

3614
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:16,560
discussion that

3615
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:19,040
we document the issues and then we try

3616
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,040
and evaluate the situation when we

3617
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:22,639
produce documents

3618
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:24,079
um and then we have some understanding

3619
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:26,079
it's not that we can totally prevent

3620
02:13:26,079 --> 02:13:27,119
some outcomes

3621
02:13:27,119 --> 02:13:28,719
but we can at least be a little bit more

3622
02:13:28,719 --> 02:13:30,560
aware so i think that's the

3623
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:33,280
key yeah

3624
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:45,679
gin

3625
02:13:45,679 --> 02:13:49,360
we can maybe now we can hear you

3626
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:52,800
uh yes hello yeah

3627
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:56,719
so for about a centralization i think

3628
02:13:56,719 --> 02:14:00,360
the internet is still distributed

3629
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:03,760
architecture and decentralized internet

3630
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:07,199
architecture is still decentralized

3631
02:14:07,199 --> 02:14:10,639
what about the centralization i think is

3632
02:14:10,639 --> 02:14:13,760
service international service is a

3633
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:16,719
centralized internet application

3634
02:14:16,719 --> 02:14:17,520
centralized

3635
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,360
for example we do use facebook for

3636
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:24,960
social internal social service

3637
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:29,199
and for uh gmail for our email service

3638
02:14:29,199 --> 02:14:33,040
so so because we are

3639
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:36,800
a very uh service pro

3640
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:39,520
internet application server service

3641
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:40,560
providers

3642
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:44,400
provide a very good service so we

3643
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:47,440
a lot of users are attracted

3644
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:50,560
to join the this

3645
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:54,159
internet service service house

3646
02:14:54,159 --> 02:14:57,360
applications so it's providers so

3647
02:14:57,360 --> 02:15:01,040
uh so so yeah i think in the future

3648
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:04,079
when our itf would provide

3649
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:07,280
more good applications uh

3650
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:10,639
protocols or some

3651
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:13,760
so there will will be more

3652
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:17,119
service in another service pro

3653
02:15:17,119 --> 02:15:20,560
providers so i maybe internet will

3654
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:24,000
internet service will be decentralized

3655
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,280
uh decentralized so my my point is

3656
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:30,639
internet is still decentralized but the

3657
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:35,840
internet service is centralized

3658
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:40,079
my point thank you

3659
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:43,679
and we have mark on the cube

3660
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:49,760
um this is in response to gary a little

3661
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,719
bit

3662
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:53,199
and i'm really glad to hear that he's

3663
02:15:53,199 --> 02:15:54,800
going to pick up the pen

3664
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,880
and do some writing but one of the

3665
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,800
observations i have in listening to this

3666
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,079
conversation

3667
02:16:00,079 --> 02:16:01,840
is that there are a lot of voices in the

3668
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,119
room uh

3669
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:05,440
and as yari noted uh sometimes some

3670
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,199
conflicting voices

3671
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:10,800
and i think um instead of trying to

3672
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:12,960
find a middle ground i think it's time

3673
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,119
to

3674
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,679
let those voices speak and so perhaps

3675
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:19,920
and this is a suggestion to the iab

3676
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:22,079
perhaps this is a natural opportunity

3677
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:24,000
for a workshop on the topic

3678
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,199
so that the iep can hear uh in a

3679
02:16:27,199 --> 02:16:29,679
in a workshop setting from a variety of

3680
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:31,040
voices on this topic

3681
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:33,439
and and perhaps to do that before

3682
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:34,638
committing the ib

3683
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:36,959
to documenting a particular

3684
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:37,920
architectural

3685
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:40,398
stance i do think that the pervasive

3686
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:42,638
surveillance example is a good one

3687
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:44,398
right because it actually jumped the

3688
02:16:44,398 --> 02:16:47,200
chasm between the iab and the iesg

3689
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:49,519
and resulted in real protocol design and

3690
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:51,679
criteria for protocol design

3691
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:53,200
and i think that that's what's needed

3692
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,080
here is some architectural direction

3693
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:58,879
that jumps that chasm again that leads

3694
02:16:58,879 --> 02:17:02,160
to criteria for good protocol design

3695
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:04,240
that's what engineers want in this space

3696
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:06,558
thanks

3697
02:17:08,478 --> 02:17:10,398
yeah everyone just to add and i think

3698
02:17:10,398 --> 02:17:12,080
that was already clear that this is like

3699
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,599
a topic that the ib actually does

3700
02:17:13,599 --> 02:17:14,080
discuss

3701
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:16,398
for a while already and and we also

3702
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:18,558
discussed i believe the opportunity to

3703
02:17:18,558 --> 02:17:21,040
have a workshop but it's also very broad

3704
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,558
topic with a lot of different thoughts

3705
02:17:22,558 --> 02:17:24,000
as you can see right now

3706
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,638
um and and for workshop you have to

3707
02:17:26,638 --> 02:17:27,599
narrow it down to

3708
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:29,359
to make it productive but i can

3709
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:31,120
guarantee that we will keep discussing

3710
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:32,398
that

3711
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:35,280
and see what we can do beyond just

3712
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:36,799
trying to work on the document that we

3713
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:43,040
already have there

3714
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:46,080
so at this point i don't see anybody

3715
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:57,679
in the queue anymore

3716
02:17:57,679 --> 02:17:59,840
i cannot read up the whole chat now and

3717
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:01,359
see if there's anything i need to reply

3718
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:02,080
to

3719
02:18:02,080 --> 02:18:04,799
um but i think last year just here to

3720
02:18:04,799 --> 02:18:06,478
tell me that we're done with the ib open

3721
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:08,638
mic or do we want to add something

3722
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:11,120
no i would suggest we go to the llc

3723
02:18:11,120 --> 02:18:12,318
board open mic

3724
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:14,718
definitely yes so thank everybody for

3725
02:18:14,718 --> 02:18:17,678
your input and your questions

3726
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,439
thank you and we can now begin the llc

3727
02:18:23,439 --> 02:18:27,040
open mic session um one quick note i

3728
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:28,638
forgot to mention during our slide

3729
02:18:28,638 --> 02:18:30,160
presentation there are

3730
02:18:30,160 --> 02:18:32,879
llc office hours this week they're on

3731
02:18:32,879 --> 02:18:33,679
the

3732
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:36,160
agenda and looks like they are occurring

3733
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,840
on thursday and friday of this week

3734
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:50,679
i'll give it a moment i don't see anyone

3735
02:18:50,679 --> 02:18:54,478
in the queue just yet

3736
02:19:04,718 --> 02:19:06,879
so there was one question the isg punted

3737
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:09,040
over to the llc board and that was on

3738
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:10,558
what what the plan is for

3739
02:19:10,558 --> 02:19:13,200
itf 111 you you said that earlier jason

3740
02:19:13,200 --> 02:19:14,718
maybe repeat it now and we'll see if

3741
02:19:14,718 --> 02:19:17,280
that clarifies it

3742
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:20,000
right uh well i will say a few things

3743
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:20,718
one

3744
02:19:20,718 --> 02:19:23,280
it the sort of what is return to normal

3745
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:24,398
if you will

3746
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:26,879
um is one of the topics for the

3747
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:28,638
strategic offsite

3748
02:19:28,638 --> 02:19:32,718
um and of course shmu is working on that

3749
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:35,760
as well and i think they'll have to be

3750
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:38,959
a lot of consultations of course the

3751
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:41,359
for the next meeting the process has

3752
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:42,318
kicked off

3753
02:19:42,318 --> 02:19:44,799
we agreed on a process for assessing

3754
02:19:44,799 --> 02:19:47,120
whether a meeting can proceed or not

3755
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:49,359
um really right after the beginning of

3756
02:19:49,359 --> 02:19:50,479
the pandemic

3757
02:19:50,479 --> 02:19:52,240
so we're using the standard process for

3758
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,760
that um

3759
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:55,359
i think the operative question is

3760
02:19:55,359 --> 02:19:57,200
whether you know that

3761
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:59,040
return to normal if you will whether

3762
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:01,520
it's 111 112 or whatever

3763
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,600
is a blended sort of thing where it's a

3764
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:06,080
mix of online and in person and i think

3765
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:07,280
you know we would all conclude the

3766
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,920
answer that seems very likely yes

3767
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:13,200
um but um exactly

3768
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,560
you know what that will look like and

3769
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:16,479
when we can return to normal really

3770
02:20:16,479 --> 02:20:20,000
mostly depends at this point on

3771
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:31,840
vaccination

3772
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:36,399
okay any other questions

3773
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:44,240
all right uh hearing none i think we're

3774
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:45,600
finished with this section

3775
02:20:45,600 --> 02:20:49,040
thank you thank you and if i'm not

3776
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:50,479
mistaken this was the last

3777
02:20:50,479 --> 02:20:53,760
uh section on the agenda so if i tell

3778
02:20:53,760 --> 02:20:55,680
alexa next slide there shouldn't be any

3779
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,680
correct

3780
02:20:57,680 --> 02:21:00,160
looks like it um thank you all enjoy the

3781
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:01,600
rest of your day the rest of your night

3782
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:01,920
and

3783
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:04,319
see you around the idea for the next few

3784
02:21:04,319 --> 02:21:04,960
days

3785
02:21:04,960 --> 02:21:13,839
bye bye

3786
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,920
you
