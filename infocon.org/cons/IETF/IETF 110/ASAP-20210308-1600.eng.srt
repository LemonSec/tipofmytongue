all right so um some info on how we're

40
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,239
going to be running the session

so any decisions that we make will be

42
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,760
confirmed on the mailing list

43
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
the meeting is being recorded if you

44
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
are at the mic please use headphones

45
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,120
when speaking to cut out issues such as

46
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,440
echo

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,080

can speak

52
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
at least i think that's the way it works

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,479
this is my first time hosting a

54
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,720
a session online so

55
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,080
gonzalo will be presenting the slides

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,280
we've got uh some resources here

57
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,560
on uh how to work with these uh working

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
group sessions down at the bottom

59
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
if you need help with uh working with

60
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,639
meat echo

61
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
next

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
all right a few things to to go

63
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,720
over so there is a jabber room although

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,759
the chat room

65
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,240
here with the meet echo session is the

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,680
same thing

67
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,960
we would like a jabber scribe

68
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,720
keep an eye out on the conversations um

69
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
raise issues is there somebody who's

70
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,840
willing to to perform that role

71
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,199
anyone

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,120
i guess type in the in the chat room if

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:07,840
you're interested

74
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
so i'm not seeing anybody

75
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
jumping in uh i guess gonzalo can you

76
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
keep an eye out on the chat room

77
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,120
i sure can yeah i'll i'll relay anything

78
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,479
that comes up in the chat room that's

79
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,840
meaningful

80
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,759
okay so the next thing would be

81
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
minutes takers any takers

82
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,919
for taking minutes

83
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,360
you can type things along in cody md

84
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,840
multiple people can work on the notes

85
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,960
simultaneously

86
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,000
lightens the load

87
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,039
is there anyone who's willing to take

88
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,560
minutes

89
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:17,840
just high-level stuff action items

90
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
so i see in the chat room we have a

91
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,880
question is there anybody actually here

92
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,080
so i have a participants list of uh 23

93
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,000
people

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
so i i see some people who are not just

95
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,720
chairs ads or medica

96
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
so it looks like um we've had two

97
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,319
volunteers costa who's one of the

98
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,919
co-authors he's willing to

99
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,520
while he's not speaking he's willing to

100
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
take minutes and uh mark pittitugano

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
is also willing to take notes

102
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,440
cool thank you very much um and

103
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,240
again you could use a cody md or if you

104
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
would like to take notes

105
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
offline and send them to the chair

106
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,319
separately that also works

107
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,319
i'm we're good with either

108
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,840
all right next slide

109
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,799
okay well i think we have taken care of

110
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,120
the administrivia

111
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,559
we have one presentation today

112
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,760
and then wrap up the next steps

113
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:55,839
so any agenda bashing

114
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,839
all right well let's continue on to the

115
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,560
presentation

116
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,959
so i think at this point the presenters

117
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,399
enter the queue and um

118
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
then they're allowed to talk

119
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,120
there we go so shri kant

131
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
benefit of those who are new here and

132
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
you know for whom asap is a new thing

133
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
and haven't had a chance to go through

134
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,040
the draft i just wanted to cover the

135
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,600
problem

136
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,279
uh in a couple of minutes that we're

137
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,720
trying to solve here

138
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,120
we presented this back in ietf 106.

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
so it's been some time and i thought

140
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,800
this would be a good refresher

141
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,200
so um yeah so today administrators

142
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
usually when

143
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,680
uh deploying uh you know their sbc or

144
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
any other equipment that peers with the

145
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,040
service provider and they're setting up

146
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,079
the sip trunk

147
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,320
they have a tedious job of you know

148
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
fixing uh interoperability issues

149
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
and things that should take them you

150
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,480
know just a couple of minutes

151
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
end up taking them a few hours and even

152
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,920
a few days

153
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,880
in fact and they end up having to open

154
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,320
service requests with

155
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,880
uh vendor equipment manufacturers as

156
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,480
well as a service provider in order to

157
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
get these problems fixed

158
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
so what we're trying to do is to bring

159
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
that pain

160
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,920
down and you know just get this get zip

161
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,720
calls up and running in a few minutes

162
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,760
uh next slide please

163
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
right so the first thing we need to find

164
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,000
out was uh you know how big is the

165
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
problem right so uh we went back to our

166
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,160
support cases

167
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,519
uh on uh this is the cisco cube which is

168
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,240
the uh

169
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,040
which is cisco's enterprise sbc and uh

170
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
we found out that around 22

171
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
of the cases directly relate to in itsp

172
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
interoperability issues

173
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,760
so uh cisco is just one of the sbc

174
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,360
manufacturers here there are many of

175
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,560
them in the market

176
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,959
so you can imagine how many uh you know

177
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,800
service requests are getting created how

178
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
many problems are there

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
that need to be solved so it's quite a

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,680
lot there

181
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,320
and apart from that you also have a

182
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,240
significant number of enterprises that

183
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
are still on analog and digital

184
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
telephony

185
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,560
and are gradually moving on to sip

186
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
trunks right so this problem

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,440
isn't going to go away we're going to

188
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,839
see this problem you know for the next

189
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
few years at least next slide please

190
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,839
right so i quickly wanted to walk

191
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,240
through the uh high level overview

192
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
of what the draft proposes so for the

193
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
purpose of this diagram we've got uh

194
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
an enterprise sbc that's sitting right

195
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
in the center and a capability server

196
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,040
that's sitting on the service provider

197
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
network

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,040
so the capability uh so the svc will

199
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,839
send a

200
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
http you know well-formed get request to

201
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,399
the capability server

202
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,320
and capability server will respond with

203
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
the required document

204
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,720
to the sbc and once it gets that

205
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,480
document it's going to either

206
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,920
automatically parse that

207
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
and configure itself or an administrator

208
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,120
can manually parse that and configure

209
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,120
the spc in order to get the zip calls

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,639
working

211
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,639
so that's a quick overview of what the

212
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,399
draft proposes our next slide please

213
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,160
right so what's inside that capability

214
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,079
set document

215
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,120
a a representation in xml

216
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
uh of you know a yang model that's being

217
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
proposed in the draft

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,040
um we're still not sure whether we're

219
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
going with the xml or the json

220
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,480
right so right now we're just

221
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
representing this in xml but the final

222
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,760
call is yet to be taken

223
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,240
and as you can see here we are covering

224
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,800
uh

225
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,760
various facets of the call setup process

226
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,279
um you know what are the transport

227
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,639
characteristics that are required for

228
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,680
the call

229
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,760
what are the media requirements for the

230
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
call what does the service providers

231
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,240
support

232
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,959
and as well as cases where the

233
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,399
enterprise and the service provider

234
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,680
let's say they want to do

235
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
sip over tls and srtp there are settings

236
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,440
for that as well

237
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
next slide please

238
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,639
right so the story so far so versions

239
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,279
one and two

240
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,760
uh we published before we presented at

241
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,440
ietf 106

242
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
and uh at the dispatch meeting at itf

243
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,120
106 we had a consensus to form a mini

244
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,000
working group

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,720
and last year we uh got a charter

246
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,360
proposed

247
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
uh which was approved as well as the

248
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,800
working group

249
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,959
work group that was formed uh late last

250
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,399
year in august of 2020

251
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,199
next slide please

252
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
right so i just wanted to quickly uh go

253
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,920
through the various changes

254
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,560
that uh you know the draft has undergone

255
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,839
over the last year

256
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,600
so versions one and two like i mentioned

257
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,959
they were the initial draft

258
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
um just a name change and some

259
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,959
formatting uh issues that were fixed

260
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
in version three we added the insert

261
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,160
location field

262
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
uh to the capability set this is for

263
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,680
deployments where the

264
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
enterprise and the service provider want

265
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,279
to do sip over tls

266
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,639
and you know you need the required

267
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,639
configuration for that so that comes

268
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,160
under the third location field

269
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,360
next slide please

270
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
in version 4 we added the num range

271
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,199
field

272
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
so the num range field basically

273
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,959
specifies the did number range that's

274
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,040
allocated to the enterprise network by

275
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,320
the service provider

276
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
and it can be communicated as a list of

277
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,360
values uh

278
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,480
as a block or a reference uh next slide

279
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
right and then we come to the latest

280
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,959
version uh

281
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,800
so in the latest version we clarified

282
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,720
you know whatever http versions that are

283
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,920
supported which is version 1.1 and above

284
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
we also define the scope of the work in

285
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,680
the draft

286
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,440
so basically we did not we do not

287
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,680
include any low level details such as

288
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
ip addressing scheme and the net access

289
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,360
network infrastructure

290
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,920
so that part of the that part is not

291
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,120
covered by the drop the

292
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
draft is just about how do you get sip

293
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,040
calls working

294
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
with rtp between the enterprise and the

295
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
service provider

296
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,800
and then we also had a we also added a

297
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
paragraph that clarifies on how the

298
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,519
workflow is going to work in case you

299
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,079
have an intermediate service provider

300
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,519
between the enterprise and the service

301
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,759
provider because what we've observed is

302
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,199
if you have an enterprise that's trying

303
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,800
to peer with let's say uh

304
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
service provider abc often that

305
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,360
connection goes via a service provider

306
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,399
xyz

307
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,480
so we've just covered that particular

308
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
scenario as well in the draft and how

309
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,920
the workflow has to adopt adapt to that

310
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,719
next slide please

311
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,320
right so this brings me to the open

312
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
issues that are

313
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,240
uh you know yet to be finalized upon in

314
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,120
the draft

315
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,759
so one uh one was the xml or the json

316
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,720
representation

317
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,759
uh for the capability set uh another

318
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,720
very important

319
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,160
uh aspect is the um discovery of the

320
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,120
capability

321
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,959
server which is sitting in the service

322
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,560
provider network we would like

323
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
this to be an automated process instead

324
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
of having the administrator go ahead and

325
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
you know configure that

326
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,040
on the sbc and point that towards you

327
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,480
know the capability server we would like

328
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,079
this to be an automated uh

329
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
you know process so for example web

330
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,760
finger is one of the frameworks that can

331
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,799
be used here

332
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,839
uh for the discovery and uh we wanted to

333
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,520
ask the larger group if there are any

334
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
other parameters that needed to be added

335
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,280
to the capability set and you know if

336
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,119
there are any modifications

337
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,439
that are required in the draft uh we got

338
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
a review today from

339
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,760
uh mark which was really helpful uh it

340
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,679
had like two specific parameters that he

341
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,360
was talking about which was

342
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,120
which related to the duration the

343
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,000
validity of that capability document

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,720
and also uh whether you know we're going

345
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,880
to add a stir specific section

346
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
so i think those are two really good uh

347
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
points that he raised thanks mark

348
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,520
uh and you know we will address those in

349
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,400
the upcoming

350
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
um upcoming uh versions of the draft

351
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,960
and if you've noticed that the um

352
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,720
capability set uh encompasses all of the

353
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,640
vendor agnostic parameters that we

354
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,480
really think are important to get sip

355
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,600
calls working

356
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,679
but we are definitely open to hearing

357
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,120
from the larger group on

358
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
anything that we've missed and anything

359
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,559
that would be more helpful

360
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,200
uh to you know make this a more seamless

361
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,160
process

362
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,720
and uh finally just i just wanted to ask

363
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,360
the group

364
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,160
if you know this uh draft is good now to

365
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,280
be adopted by the working group as well

366
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,640
yeah uh thanks gene

367
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,160
come to the

371
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,720
the mic with any questions or comments

372
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:57,840
raise your hand

373
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,640
i am not seeing anyone entering the

374
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,559
queue

375
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,679
i'm not seeing anything in the chat room

376
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,120
so i'm curious as to how many people

377
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,799
have read the draft i'm going to try

378
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,720
the show of hands tool so

379
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,480
i will type the question in

380
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:39,840
and send it to the session start session

381
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
foreign

382
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,000
okay i'm going to end the session i

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,360
assume that

384
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,559
if you have read the draft you have

385
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,640
raised your hand hey gene i i don't see

386
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,200
the

387
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,480
show hands tool um let me stop sharing

388
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
and see if that helps

389
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,520
huh did um

390
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,200
let's see oh so

391
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
in the chat room i hear got nothing for

392
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,120
him showing

393
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,600
yeah so so some people were able to

394
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:03,840
um show their hands um

395
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,799
so shall i it sounds like i

396
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,039
maybe need to run this again

397
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,799
and i can do that um

398
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,240
it looks like not everybody got to see

399
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,080
the show of hands tool when i started

400
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,600
the show of hand session

401
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,240
um let me try this again so i'm going to

402
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,919
click the show of hands tool

403
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,120
which is this bar chart

404
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,320
icon and

405
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,480
we i will start a session

406
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,520
so um what displays for me

407
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,640
it i see it now gene okay

408
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,720
yeah so if people are not

409
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,360
seeing a have you read the draft

410
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
question

411
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,000
i guess add something to the chat room

412
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,840
and i'm getting better numbers this time

413
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,679
so yeah let us know in the chat room if

414
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,320
you're having

415
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,918
issues with this

416
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:55,840
i'll give it a moment or two more

417
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,039
okay so um

418
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,480
i i guess it's showing both

419
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,960
of the um raised hands

420
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
i should have disambiguated them so

421
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,600
the um one with the higher number of

422
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,559
raised hands

423
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,080
was the second one that i ran so

424
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,159
nine people have said they've read read

425
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,799
the draft

426
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,080
um so i

427
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,440
guess at this point we can ask the

428
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,840
second question

429
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,320
so i'm going to do another raise hands

430
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,840
as soon as i can type the question in

431
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
so you should now see a second question

432
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,880
should the working group adopt the draft

433
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,159
as a working group item

434
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,760
oh wait somebody said maybe oh we have

435
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,320
uh

436
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,430
john peterson in the queue um

437
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,760
[Music]

438
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,039
sorry john let me oh go ahead sorry

439
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,799
no i was just gonna say i mean is there

440
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,159
an alternative like

441
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,200
you know i mean work item right and like

442
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,279
i mean i it's it's kind of academic it's

443
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,720
important that people read it but

444
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,559
you know i i think enough people say

445
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,559
they read it nobody's talking about it i

446
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,279
mean

447
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,559
we just need to do this right

448
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,559
this is true there is not another

449
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,559
alternative unless somebody

450
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,640
stands up and says hey i got another

451
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,600
draft

452
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,960
um but uh we will be

453
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
confirming this decision on the mailing

454
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,520
list

455
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,480
i i note that the the draft does

456
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,679
and as the tree pointed out there are

457
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,760
still open issues that need to be worked

458
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,240
on

459
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,320
so there's some stuff to do

460
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,279
what i see here is that um we've got

461
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,320
eight people have well we should be vote

462
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,919
voting like this but

463
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,799
there is support for um adopting the

464
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,600
draft

465
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,520
and we will confirm this on the list

466
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
is there um any other

467
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,520
comments or questions anybody like to

468
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,240
come to the queue

469
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,879

470
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600

471
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,918
hello

472
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,039
hello we we can we can hear your costume

473
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:05,919
okay great

474
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,320
uh i i just wanted to tie back it to the

475
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,360
point that

476
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,000
shri khan's raised with regards to store

477
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,799
uh we j

478
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,000
we i mean i think all all of us in

479
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,600
you know the co-authors basically feel

480
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
that stir uh from the perspective of

481
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,360
enterprise and service provider networks

482
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,200
is going to play a pivotal role

483
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,000
and we must have something that is

484
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
specific to store as far as

485
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
this framework and this graph is

486
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,640
concerned however at this point in time

487
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,120
there are a lot of aspects of stuff that

488
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,640
are yet to be finalized

489
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,559
so for example stuff that's specific to

490
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,320
which call data

491
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,840
delegate certificates and things like

492
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,279
that so i think there's some vector of

493
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,840
dependency over there and you know as

494
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,240
as and when some of some of the star

495
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,559
stuff goes towards standardization

496
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,240
i think we can incorporate elements of

497
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,799
that into uh into the asap effort but

498
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,120
uh from the perspective of you know

499
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,880
fleshing out a framework and a draft

500
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,559
that has all the elements to it that are

501
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,400
that are required from an enterprise

502
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
to service providers ship trunking

503
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,880
scenario we definitely feel that

504
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,400
you know something related to stove

505
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,880
would be of great importance so i just

506
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,480
wanted to highlight that aspect as well

507
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,840
thank you

508
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:34,880
mark please go ahead

509
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
hi can you hear me okay probably uh yes

510
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,039
just to

511
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,360
respond to what was just said about

512
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,440
i think that it's true that we are

513
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,240
far from from having a mechanism for a

514
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,480
delegated certificate in store but it

515
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,080
does not prevent to start

516
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,360
doing the work in this draft and then

517
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,399
a solid solution if at the time where

518
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,559
this draft is read ready but we still do

519
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,960
not have all the

520
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,520
mechanism in place we can split it and

521
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,880
do an extension

522
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,799
separately but i don't think that

523
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,600
prevents to start doing so

524
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,918
thank you

525
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,200
thank you

526
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,640
kostip would you like to say something

527
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,520
more

528
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,799
please go ahead yeah i i just wanted to

529
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,679
uh

530
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,279
you know just to say that i kind of

531
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,039
agree with what mark brought up

532
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,399
um so we will basically see how how

533
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,240
uh you know the store effort plans out

534
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,679
and the timelines of that

535
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,360
and we'll decided the best approach

536
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,880
possible whether we need to embed

537
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
something with regards to stuff within

538
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,200
this draft or or propose an extension as

539
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,440
when some of the store stuff becomes

540
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,559
mature and all of the

541
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,200
all of the cogs to that framework have

542
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,559
been ironed out so

543
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,039
i think i kind of have an agreement with

544
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:11,919
what mark which is part of right now

545
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:12,480
thank you

546
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,600
thank you jonathan jonathan

547
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,240
please go ahead

548
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,200
hey guys uh so you know i'm obviously

549
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
supportive of moving forward the draft

550
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,039
um couple comments one is um

551
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,039
casa been everyone i have a draft in a

552
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,520
similar area at this ietf meeting that

553
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:33,840
uh

554
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,360
talks about high availability um

555
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,399
be on sip trunks there's some overlap

556
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,840
actually in the configuration data

557
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,279
there's a configuration mechanism

558
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
defined in my draft as well so

559
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,799
i'd encourage you guys to take a look at

560
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,559
that um

561
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,200
and i'm happy to collaborate on it um

562
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
and then the second comment is

563
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,000
on the actual elements in the in the

564
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,720
yaml

565
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
i like to me there's there's two very

566
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,000
different types of stuff in there

567
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,080
there's stuff that the sbc and the

568
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,919
receiving end probably knows about and

569
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,520
can easily

570
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,679
create the configuration file from it

571
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,960
and then there's the

572
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
stuff that's a little harder the num

573
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,320
range was the one in particular that

574
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,279
struck me as

575
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,000
uh as quite a different story and that

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,279
relates to the

577
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,320
stir stuff so my question slash feedback

578
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:22,640
is

579
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,760
you know to minimize the scope of the

580
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,480
document

581
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,480
to only be that which can easily be

582
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
implemented meaning the terminating spc

583
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,760
and the carrier side can basically

584
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,360
generate this document trivially from

585
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,880
its configuration and if it's

586
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,559
more than that then push it out of scope

587
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,559
for now so that this can actually get

588
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,919
implemented and deployed

589
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,960
that's my main feedback

590
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,880
thank you jonathan hey jonathan

591
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,399
one quick question though for jonathan

592
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,120
um i i saw the draft

593
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,480
that you put forward i haven't read it

594
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,200
but is is it problematic overlap or is

595
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,159
it complementary

596
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,399
it's mostly complementary i mean it just

597
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,320
needs to be reconciled the the bulk of

598
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,919
the draft is

599
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,760
more on the aha mechanisms and it

600
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,000
requires a configuration of the set of

601
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,840
ip addresses of the clusters in the

602
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,200
instance

603
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,880
um and so that piece defines a json

604
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,760
document you fetch vhtp so i mean it's

605
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,279
just a question of making sure that

606
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,240
these things

607
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,039
line up and they're either in you know

608
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,679
do you think

609
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,440
so i so i think it's mostly

610
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,559
complementary and we just have to

611
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,399
reconcile these two these are not like

612
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,519
pick a or b they're not like that

613
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,679
okay yeah obviously it'd be helpful uh

614
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,440
jonathan now you put that out there

615
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,880
if you've got cycles to just kind of

616
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,320
keep an eye on this draft as it

617
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,600
progresses

618
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,159
yeah did you i i was quickly trying to

619
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,679
scan through is there something in the

620
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,399
draft that

621
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,600
enumerates the ip address set for the

622
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,880
um the carriers

623
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,080
uh does that call controlled

624
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,880
all right costume yeah do you have that

625
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,480
the call control is a set of ip

626
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,519
addresses yeah i see that okay

627
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,840
okay

628
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,799
yeah so i'll i'll send comments on the

629
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,399
list basically it overlaps with the call

630
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,679
control field

631
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,720
uh in the ammo file um

632
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,760
so we either need to bring the the

633
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,600
couple additional parameters in my draft

634
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,880
into this

635
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,120
or or something like that it's probably

636
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,159
the right thing okay

637
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,600
yeah yeah just okay okay

638
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,799
hey jonathan nice to see you here uh

639
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,880
so with with uh with regards to your

640
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,120
comment on you know kind of simplifying

641
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,840
stuff for

642
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
uh service providers so that it's

643
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,919
actually deployed and adopted i i agree

644
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,880
i certainly would be very difficult for

645
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,720
a service provider to keep track of the

646
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,480
drd range for every single enterprise

647
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,840
that registers in

648
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,360
uh i i was thinking probably it would

649
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,120
probably make sense to make that

650
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,720
specific parameter optional

651
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,240
uh as opposed to remove it all together

652
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,440
that that was where i was leaning

653
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,640
my sense again it's like you know

654
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
keep it simple and you know perfect is

655
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,120
the enemy the good i think there's gonna

656
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,159
there's no shortage of of stuff being

657
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,760
worked on around passing around phone

658
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,679
numbers and how we convey them as it

659
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,760
relates to some of the store stuff too i

660
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,440
think you just yank it you can you can

661
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,039
always extend it later

662
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,120
um but get this thing done and and this

663
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,080
way you don't have to worry about

664
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,399
reconciling with all that other stuff

665
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,000
but i don't feel that strongly

666
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,200
thanks

667
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,480
cullen um please go ahead

668
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,279
i just had to unmute a few times and i

669
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,120
finally got there uh

670
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
so just sort of on the comment of that

671
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,399
number range stuff i

672
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
i feel like there's sort of like you

673
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,080
know there's sip trunks that are meant

674
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,039
for like

675
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,240
a you know like like a call center

676
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,919
to a lot to a bunch of different large

677
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,600
carriers or they're very different from

678
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
one that's for a small pbx and a small

679
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,039
business

680
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,560
up to um up to a service provider

681
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,079
and so maybe we just we probably need to

682
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,359
talk a little bit more about those than

683
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,800
where the number ranges make sense in

684
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,839
certain cases i mean

685
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,800
for the small pbx case then the carrier

686
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,000
is allocating a very

687
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,679
specific number range and it's very well

688
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,879
known and it's you know it's generally

689
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,440
like you know

690
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,480
here's your 50 numbers um so

691
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,960
i i i think we probably went thinking

692
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,399
more back about those drafts we probably

693
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,760
just weren't really clear enough about

694
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,199
what these all were and when you used

695
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,320
them when they were optional when they

696
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:34,800
made it

697
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,000
and whether they helped i mean like

698
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,359
let's not put stuff in here that's not

699
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,639
needed right that was the whole idea of

700
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,000
simplifying this so i think we should

701
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
just all get together and talk about

702
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,239
those and see what makes sense

703
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,199
thank you uh john peterson

704
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,480
please go ahead yeah i mean i was kind

705
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,520
of wondering

706
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,359
like how automatable and this is part of

707
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,960
that conversation you know really are

708
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
like telephone numbers

709
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,599
like i mean it's you know

710
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,280
if an enterprise gets a block of like 50

711
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
telephone numbers is the assignment of

712
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,079
those numbers

713
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,119
automatic like too arbitrary i guess is

714
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,160
my point

715
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,079
or you know i mean if you're only

716
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,520
learning about what telephone numbers

717
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
you got

718
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,560
from like in you know auto config with

719
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,839
the service provider

720
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,680
like surely there's some like manual

721
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,040
interventionists to follow that right so

722
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,520
i mean

723
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,359
i guess this is this is why i i think i

724
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,520
might be with jonathan on this and that

725
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,720
i can imagine um you know use cases

726
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,160
where this might make sense

727
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,040
but like it's not like dcp or just

728
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
doesn't matter what numbers you get

729
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,800
right

730
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,599
thank you jonathan please go ahead

731
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,839
yeah and and to call on me my point is

732
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,000
not that there's too many numbers

733
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,040
it's that uh it john makes another great

734
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,640
point which is the enterprise

735
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,079
probably needs to take manual steps once

736
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,000
they get the numbers my point is the

737
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,560
service provider even if it's one number

738
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
i would be skeptical that it is very

739
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,320
easy for a service provider to implement

740
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,160
some software that magically produces

741
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,119
that number

742
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,040
in response to the http get request to

743
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,720
get this document because again the

744
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,400
implementation model i have in mind is

745
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,160
like okay you've got a carrier

746
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,560
they've got an sbc it's terminating the

747
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,800
call someone's typed in the config

748
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,520
into the cli on this svc the phone

749
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,280
numbers are stored elsewhere

750
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
and i don't know where and it's probably

751
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
a disastrous mess

752
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
and maybe even the spc doesn't know them

753
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,560
so the spc could serve the http get

754
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,320
request for the rest of this document

755
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,160
but not for the phone numbers at least

756
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,760
not easily in my opinion so

757
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,320
even if it's just one phone number so

758
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,160
i'm just suggesting keep it simple and

759
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,599
because they're easy to they're hard to

760
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:40,160
generate

761
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,599
and they're difficult to consume it

762
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,920
feels like you just remove it

763
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,040
well there's one thing that

764
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,839
the spc does know and that is which

765
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,599
incoming sip requests it routes down

766
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:52,880
this sip trunk

767
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,880
um and it uses the phone number to do

768
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,920
that generally so

769
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
i i i don't know i mean i i think we

770
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,960
have to dig around this i totally agree

771
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,160
with peterson's comment that it's not

772
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,079
just like this is not like dhcp

773
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,119
most definitely the case right colin

774
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,880
that is not how mine works actually so

775
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,000
that wouldn't work no but that's what

776
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,640
i'm talking about

777
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,560
the ones for small business sbcs it

778
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,079
would be how yours work right

779
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,040
like i mean how else would an sbc

780
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,480
possibly work that was serving sip

781
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,200
trunks to

782
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,880
a small business for incoming costs

783
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,240
and that's why i said i differentiated

784
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,800
these two cases but for that case right

785
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,720
like the microsoft small business what

786
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,839
was the sip connect

787
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,560
spec like all of that stuff right like

788
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,920
that stuff

789
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,240
yeah it does sort of know right it's

790
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:34,960
configured

791
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,720
as a trunk group parameter in the cpuri

792
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,079
as opposed to an actual phone number i

793
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,200
mean the phone number might be in the

794
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,640
cpr itself

795
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,480
uh and the like the two or request your

796
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,880
eye but but it's

797
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,119
um but the the thing that knows like

798
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,040
determines where to send the call

799
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,760
is possibly based on upstream trunk

800
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,400
group

801
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,839
definitions that's how we do it for

802
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,560
example so but if you had a small

803
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,599
if at t had a had a bunch of customers

804
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,359
and it had an incoming call to a given

805
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,160
phone number

806
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
and had to decide which one of those

807
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,480
customers it sent the sip invite to

808
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,320
right like it would use the phone number

809
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,599
to route that

810
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,760
sure in the software and that's the type

811
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,040
of trunk we're talking about for the

812
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,880
this that that case and what i don't

813
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,240
think the draft makes any of that at all

814
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,520
clear right i just i just think that

815
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,320
that's like

816
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,599
i'm not even saying we need that in the

817
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,800
draft i have no idea what's needed or

818
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
not needed but it just seems like

819
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,119
uh that that people were thinking of a

820
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:27,040
different use case than the type of

821
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,920
uh then sip trunks that were for

822
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,920
outbound calls are very for very generic

823
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,480
termination

824
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,880
thank you srikanth you have a comment to

825
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,119
that

826
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,839
yeah i think when when we were uh you

827
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,560
know putting in the that particular

828
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,440
field

829
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,359
uh what we were thinking about was a

830
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,200
specific use case where

831
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,680
sometimes what we've observed is when an

832
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,040
enterprise doesn't

833
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,359
uh sorry yeah when an enterprise doesn't

834
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,200
you know send the right phone number it

835
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,920
gets rejected uh by the service provider

836
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,400
so because the service programs provide

837
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
us pretty strict about what kind of

838
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,200
numbers are being uh

839
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,440
advertised by the enterprise so that was

840
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,240
the sort of

841
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,320
um you know use case that we had in mind

842
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,960
but yeah

843
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,240
i think it it makes sense that if if it

844
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,480
does if it's a mess and it does make it

845
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,320
more complicated then

846
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,160

847
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
