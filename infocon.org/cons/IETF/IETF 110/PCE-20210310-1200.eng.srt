13
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,360
[Music]

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
so i guess you are familiar now with the

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
way of working during those virtual

16
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,240
meetings

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,240
so just remember

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,840
just keep in mind that we are recording

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,759
the session so as usual

20
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
just take your name when you start

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,680
talking

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
uh respect the queues and so on there is

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,600
a

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
summary afterwards so they're not well

25
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,360
first

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,399
you should be aware of them already as

27
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,000
well

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,840
it's the same as before anything you may

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
[Music]

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840

ietf policy with respect

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
to the intel intellectual property so

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,080
make sure that all the process related

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
mentioned there

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
okay so back to the online tips

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120
so if you want the one presenting make

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
sure that your video

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,319
on your mic i are off

42
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
headsets are better we've witnessed a

43
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,440
couple of times people using

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,400
mic embedded in laptops and sometimes

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
thrown back

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
the speaker sounds so

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,040
try to make them

48
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,599

49
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,000
the most efficient as possible

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,440
the blue sheets are automatically filled

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,840
in

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,959
using the data tracker information

53
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
connected to the medical tool

54
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,879
there is a chat we'll try to

55
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
follow a thing that may happen on the

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
chat if someone wants to say something

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
but is unable to reach the virtual queue

58
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,790
we may tunnel some info from there

[Music]

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,760
i don't think it happens much time but

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
just in case

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
be aware that there is this channel

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,840
available

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,480
uh for more info about the

65
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,519
mythical tool there's a couple of

66
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
there are a couple of links here but i

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:40,959
guess

68
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,080
that since we're already wednesday

69
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,159
it should be all right for most of you

70
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,920
so we have harry acting as a

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
minute taker but if other

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,560
want to join the collaborative minutes

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,439
we use the code emd tool so the link is

74
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,000
available

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,120
here you may help harry taking down

76
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,599
notes here

77
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
in any case thanks harry for taking

78
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,599
those early notes

79
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
during the meeting

80
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,680
there is some behavior related to the

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,358
way the virtual meeting are

82
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,080
handled so press the

the mailing list as usual keep in mind

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,120
that

most of the work is supposed to be

happening on the pc mailing list

especially to share issues

share resolutions on the action in front

those issues in case

131
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
some private discussion happens in the

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,800
a load but please make sure that after

134
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
the conclusion the working group is

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,440
aware or what have been discussed

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
privately i make sure that

137
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,560
the working group endorses what has been

138
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,880
discussed privately

139
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,160
make sure that everyone is aware of

each major steps

141
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,479
it's all the more true for new draft we

see

agenda but

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
some of them have never been discussed

146

nor presented

on the media list which is a pity

148
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,319
the process here is based on gouging

149
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,360
interest and consensus on if you want to

150
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,160
make sure that the consensus is properly

list as much as possible

155
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,960
as a reminder in case there is a

156
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,720
tie between slots to allocate to

157
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,319
the pc agenda we will private as more

158
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,440
for draft which have been

159
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,759
actively discussed using the mainly list

160
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,080
as opposed to the one who's just been

161
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,719
ignoring me

162
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,879
we've been also witnessing a couple of

163
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,360
times

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
some working group adoption calls or

165
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,919
working glasses with a very

166
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,639
limited number of responses it hasn't

167
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,360
really have the chairs to go to interest

168
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,840
so

169
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
please make sure that at these steps

it's always useful if you have some

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,958
explanation when you want to disagree

177
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,479
something that's even better of course

178
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,120
but

179
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,039
make sure that your view will expect

180
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,279
because it's impossible

181
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,120
to the chair to distinguish between

182
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,959
people just ignoring the world because

183
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,040
they don't care people who are busy

184
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,240
on people who just

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,720
support but believe it's okay without

186
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
telling it so make sure to be local on

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
the mailing list as well especially on

188
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:56,959
those

189
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,560
key steps review

190
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
ideas review

191
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
document at each stage of course that's

192
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
always useful

193
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,160
we're working as a community on the

194
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
community

195
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,399
reviews output discussion is always

196
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,760
valuable

197
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,440
at any time we see there are some

198
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
threats and progress on the media is

199
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,040
related to individual draft it's always

200
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,399
relevant

201
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,920
it shows interest on some topics

202
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,720
it's also part of the working process to

203
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
see

204
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,120
early discussion on draft

205
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,640
so consider that each step is valuable

206
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
on using the mailing list as well

207
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,080
is a way to move forward

208
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,320
we have some cues available on the wiki

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,959
for working group last calls on working

210
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,839
up adoption

211
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
so in case you catch

212
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,839
error on them please mention them

213
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,519
contact the chairs and secretary

214
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,600
will try to make that up to date as much

215
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
as possible

216
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,959
so the wiki here we have a summary

217
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,200
of the main items including the wiki

218
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,839
you should be able to make it update if

219
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:18,320
your

220
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,519
documents aren't fully covered or

221
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
not up to date

222
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
so the link is included in the slide so

223
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,800
you may have a look on this

224
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
it's particularly useful to see where

225
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,320
your

226
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
document lies because we have those

227
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,320
buffers there and we try to flush them

228
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,959
quite efficiently but it's still they

229
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,000
keep

230
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
filling in as well so it's a

231
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,880
slow process cut multi location

232
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,880
so we have more and more

233
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
early allocation

234
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,719
requests for working with drafts

235
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,680
it requires some specific

236
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,839
processing from the cherry ready on

237
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,480
ayana

238
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,720
it's particularly useful for

239
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,279
early testing between multiple

240
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,240
implementation to make sure that the

241
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,800
implementations are

242
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,920
correct unable to interoperate that the

243
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,800
specification

244
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,480
is is correct keep in mind that

245
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
in most of the registries we have also

246
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
allocated some ranges

247
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,920
for experimental code points so make

248
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,040
sure that

249
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,399
what you need can't be

250
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,240
addressed using the special total code

251
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,399
points before requesting early

252
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,279
allocation because

253
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,040
it's quite

254
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,519
high in the way the specification must

255
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,480
be stable

256
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,600
on what will be associated to allocated

257
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,959
code points

258
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,720
so don't rush too too

259
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
too quickly on the earlier location

260
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,639
sometimes it's

261
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,600
not fully ready

262
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,959
if you really think it's useful on

263
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,120
if it matches the criteria listed in rc

264
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
7120 then we can start on the irrigation

265
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,920
process

266
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,160
we also have this tract over the wiki as

267
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,600
indicated by turning here

268
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,519
the agenda so it's been shared for a

269
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,360
while already

270
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
if anyone's want to comment on the

271
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,359
agenda

272
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,680
no one nothing to bash okay

273
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,560
so working group status

274
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,000
so since the last meeting we

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,519
don't have any new rfc published but

276
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,560
we have four with the

277
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,720
rfc editor bi-directional association

278
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,360
pcc situation policy

279
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
on flowspec so

280
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,440
they are likely to be published by the

281
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
next meeting

282
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,440
of police see how all these

283
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
will progress

284
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
still with the working group uh so

285
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,040
anarata has been reported

286
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,079
this week pretty easy one to

287
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,240
to handle so it will be sent to

288
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,560
john i guess in a very near future

289
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,760
we have some inr

290
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,320
allocation in progress as well

291
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
local protection enforcement will expire

292
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,839
expire in next january

293
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,120
the segment routing policy

294
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
is in process and the binding label seed

295
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,839
has been requested

296
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
so i think i'll leave you the floor

297
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,000
graph for the status of the working

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,399
group

299
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,600
ideas thanks julian i'll try to go

300
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,480
i'll try to go over uh the working group

301
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,920
id status quickly

302
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
if someone has a comment on their id

303
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,839
please join the queue

304
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,399
and i will also monitor the queue while

305
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,040
i'm

306
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
presenting so the first document that we

307
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,160
have

308
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,720
are the documents which are almost ready

309
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
and nearing the working group last call

310
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
so this would be a good time

311
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
to review them uh the first one is

312
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:53,680
bindingsid

313
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,399
this was discussed in the last meeting

314
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,079
between the last meeting and now one

315
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:58,880
main change

316
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,399
is adding of uh the pc allocation of

317
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,240
binding said which was moved from the

318
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,519
pcc id

319
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,600
to the binding set id and this was

320
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,560
discussed

321
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,600
uh on the list as well and as earlier

322
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,120
said the next thing would be

323
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
working with last call as well as ina

324
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,880
allocation for this so we will be

325
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
starting

326
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,959
on this pretty soon uh with enhanced

327
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,120
errors we had a refresh

328
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,519
we want to make sure that uh there is

329
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,199
still an interest

330
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,399
in this work we have not seen this being

331
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,519
utilized

332
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,800
uh in other ids yet so that

333
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
is also an item that we want to see that

334
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,480
other

335
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
other documents use this procedure so

336
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
that's something which is lacking

337
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
so you want to see whether the working

338
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,440
group is still interested

339
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,040
so when we do the working group last

340
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,880
call if you think that this work needs

341
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,839
to be published

342
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,079
please show your interest otherwise we

343
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,720
will not go forward with this

344
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,519
just a heads up

345
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,279
with psep yang a new version was posted

346
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,880
there were a couple of changes with

347
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,920
respect to

348
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
some type devs were changed to identity

349
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,240
so that it can be easily extended

350
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
there was an alignment with using lsp

351
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,800
identifier tlvs

352
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,680
uh as a key information instead of

353
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,759
putting a reference to itfte

354
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,880
this was done so that sr

355
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,079
case can also be easily handled some of

356
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,120
the dependencies

357
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
which we are itfte something

358
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,959
related to our tls are all making good

359
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,040
progress so we hope that this document

360
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
would also be ready for

361
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,560
working group last call soon we had done

362
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,800
a early young doctor review

363
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,360
and there is a possibility that before

364
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
the working with last call we will

365
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,759
get one more done so that everything is

366
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,240
proper

367
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,639
uh another document which is nearing

368
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,320
working with last call is the stateful

369
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,680
gmpls document

370
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,519
this was merged there was a merge

371
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,360
between two separate documents

372
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,279
which was handling uh the extension for

373
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,679
stateful and pc initiate it was merged

374
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,959
as a single document

375
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,760
and there was some editorial change that

376
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,640
was done

377
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,839
and authors have published this we hope

378
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,679
that this document is also now

379
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,480
ready for working group uh last call how

380
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,280
meown go ahead

381
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,640
question mark has a very ended but i

382
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,079
would like to say okay yes

383
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,880
i think this document is ready for

384
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,720
working for glasgow

385
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,440
and the comments and review are always

386
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
welcome

387
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,919
noted

388
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
uh next are some of the other working

389
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,400
group ids uh

390
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
we have a native ip this is on agenda so

391
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,679
i will

392
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,679
not go on uh like uh

393
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,120
only thing that i would like to mention

394
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,039
that there is some coordination needed

395
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,320
uh between

396
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
idr working group especially with

397
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
respect to bgp consideration so this is

398
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
something that we need to handle at some

399
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
point of time before we

400
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
last called this work so this is

401
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
something that we can also discuss

402
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,400
during the agenda time

403
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,760
if there is a need with flex grid we had

404
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,799
a refresh

405
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,840
there was not much technical change in

406
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,400
flexgrid

407
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,240
uh with srv6 uh no major change but one

408
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,440
pending comment

409
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,240
from itf 109 is still pending there is a

410
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
need to align the sid structure

411
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
across various documents that is adding

412
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
sit structure so that is something

413
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,039
that is yet to be done uh just a

414
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,080
reminder

415
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,840
uh with vn association uh we had no

416
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
update but the document

417
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,039
basically seems to be uh ready

418
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,039
uh we had uh sr path segment uh

419
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
an update where support for srv6 was

420
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,559
added

421
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,960
uh this was earlier in the appendix but

422
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,000
now that

423
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,679
it has been moved from appendix to the

424
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,200
main body and

425
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,360
uh one of the flags which was described

426
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,440
in this document is actually moved

427
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,760
to the binding set itself because that's

428
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
the document that we are sending to

429
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,480
isg first so it's better to

430
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,039
move this flag from path segment to

431
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,840
binding signal

432
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,160
for sr bi-directional i think the main

433
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
sync is all the changes that were done

434
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,799
in the bi-directional id are also done

435
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
now in the sr so this is very good that

436
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
we are maintaining consistency in our

437
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,559
document so thanks authors

438
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,679
for doing that uh

439
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,640
we have sr policy this is on the agenda

440
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,520
uh

441
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,679
there is a update which was done even uh

442
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,919
this week so which is pretty good

443
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,080
we had one issue with the association

444
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,120
source uh

445
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
which was resolved on the list so thanks

446
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,400

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
allocation request which is in progress

449
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,360

comment on

509
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,400
how the previous version was

510
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,000
not out i mean during this association

511
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,880
id

512
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
allocation which was using

513
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,280
which was kind of um not

514
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,400
a standard way to you know to to behave

515
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,640
for an association so

516
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,600
i believe we fixed it uh in you know in

517
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,799
version 02

518
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,000
and we will describe the solution

519
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,360
uh in this presentation

520
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,440
and version 3 and 4 were basically a lot

521
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,200
of editorial comments

522
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,799
and just cleaning up and restructuring

523
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,039
just moving some text around

524
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,360
to make it easier to read and so on

525
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,039
and addressing a lot of kind of

526
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,080
editorial issues

527
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,520
and to prepare for iron allocation

528
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,400
next slide please

529
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,080
so basically um

530
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,320
in version zero two uh we basically enco

531
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,880
we encode the policy id which is this

532
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
three tuple hidden

533
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,000
color endpoint we encoded as the

534
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,640
association parameters

535
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
which association parameters if you

536
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,400
recall is

537
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,840
like the key of the association

538
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,320
so basically our association key becomes

539
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,880
this

540
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,720
exactly the same as the policy id

541
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,120
which is very convenient because our

542
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
association

543
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,159
uh in our model the association actually

544
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,600
you know corresponds to the policy

545
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,760
as a group of candidate paths

546
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,480
so the association source in the

547
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,679
association object

548
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,039
is like an ipv4 or ipv6 address and so

549
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,799
that encodes the hidden part of the

550
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,679
policy id and we

551
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,039
uh make it mandatory in this draft to

552
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,240
include the extended association id

553
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,760
tlv uh which follows this

554
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,840
uh special format here

555
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,360
which has uh the color and end point

556
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,799
and so basically this uh extended id

557
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,960
you know acts as like a as an identifier

558
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,440
it

559
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,200
you know it becomes similar to like uh

560
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,279
uh like a a route distinguisher in bgp

561
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,670
right sort of

562
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,840
[Music]

563
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,679
so

564
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,279
um and we removed one of the obvious

565
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,320
that was there before

566
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,000
uh in the version zero one draft that

567
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,520
was used for

568
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,159
carrying the uh sr policy

569
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,080
color and end point so that tov was

570
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,240
is not necessary anymore because we put

571
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,200
the same information into the

572
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,000
extended association idtlv

573
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,360
um as part of the as part of this

574
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,360
uh opaque key uh next slide please

575
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,360
so this is kind of the

576
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
the um

577
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,919
example of

578
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,080
a problematic situation that

579
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
we you know we focused on that we want

580
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,720
to prevent any kind of race conditions

581
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
or something like that

582
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,080
when there's two pc's that are connected

583
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,640
to the same head end

584
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,080
and they both try to create

585
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,279
two different candidate paths for the

586
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,480
same as our policy

587
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,760
and so they they they do it at you know

588
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,400
exactly the same time

589
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
and so they have to be able to pick an

590
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,440
association key without

591
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,039
talking to each other ideally

592
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,399
and basically

593
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,159
the way that the previous version of the

594
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,760
draft would resolve this

595
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
um situation is that it would let the

596
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,840
head end kind of

597
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,840
allocate is that basically the pcs would

598
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,640
send

599
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,640
like kind of an empty id a zero id

600
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,520
and the headend would allocate uh some

601
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
number

602
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,720
for the id and it was pointed out that

603
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,640
this is

604
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,760
a kind of going outside of the existing

605
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,879
association bsap association standard

606
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
so there was kind of a discussion on the

607
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,799
mailing list about that

608
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,480
and the solution that we came up with is

609
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,720
to just make the color endpoint as

610
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,960
uh part of the key of the association

611
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,760
uh so that basically when the two pcs

612
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
want to create

613
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,720
two um candidate paths for the same

614
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,440
policy

615
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,520
they they can agree

616
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,720
uh without talking to each other um

617
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,840
about the association

618
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,760
key right because they know the color

619
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,240
endpoint

620
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,200
of this of this policy so they can

621
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
generate the key from

622
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,799
from that and so here you have

623
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,600
uh candidate path a and candidate path b

624
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,039
being created at the same time

625
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,559
and they both have color 100

626
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,000
and 0.999

627
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,960
and as you can see we put uh the

628
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,200
association source as one one one

629
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,799
and uh association extended id

630
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,880
is 100 comma 999

631
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,799
and so you know they're they're

632
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,880
obviously the two pcs are able to do

633
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,399
this

634
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,480
without talking to each other so that

635
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,880
you know fits our condition

636
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,720
um so yeah that's the change

637
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,480
um in version two

638
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,760
uh next slide please

639
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,440
yeah so that we have requested uh ayana

640
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
code points

641
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
and uh there are some

642
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,919
there's a cisco proof of concept

643
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,600
implementation

644
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
uh there's a juniper proof of concept

645
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,520
implementation

646
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,559
uh so it'd be really useful you know to

647
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:52,960
have

648
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,880
code points now because then we could

649
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,440
start testing between the vendors

650
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,480
so that's it for my presentation i'll

651
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,360
leave some time

652
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,959
for questions thanks

653
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,080
are there any questions for mike

654
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
uh mike one thing also i would like to

655
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,840
highlight here was that one change

656
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,200
is that we use the fixed value one for

657
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,000
an association

658
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,799
id uh that is something also we should

659
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,120
ask

660
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,760
working group for a feedback if uh if

661
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
they have any other suggestion that this

662
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,080
should be

663
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,159
handled so it would be good to conclude

664
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,640
on that as well

665
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,799
uh okay yeah sure um yeah so basically

666
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
you know like i said we have this

667
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,360
extended association id

668
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,799
which encodes the color endpoint uh but

669
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,960
inside the association object there is a

670
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,159
16-bit

671
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,600
association id value and so we basically

672
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,678
put one the value one arbitrarily there

673
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,480
and so

674
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,799
um so yeah so if anybody has any kind of

675
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,640
comments or suggestions of

676
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
uh what else we can put there then

677
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,799
please uh you know let me know

678
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,840
let us know

679
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,120
boris go ahead

680
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,679
a very short question mike in

681
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,360
implementation status

682
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,440
you say about xr proof of concept

683
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,799
is with some jxr version or some

684
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,760
engineering one

685
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,000
uh it's currently it's currently

686
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,320
like an engineering release

687
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,640
so if you know if if uh

688
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,519
another vendor is interested in doing

689
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,279
interop

690
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,000
you can ask us for like a engineering

691
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,640
smooth

692
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,360
or engineering you know patch to enable

693
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,679
the

694
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:19,519
the feature and that can be done

695
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:24,000
thank you mike so let's move to the next

696
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,279
let's move to the next presentation

697
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:33,840
which is sedalgo samuel

698
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
thank you uh hi also someone will sit

699
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
down from cisco speaking

700
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,080
i'll be presenting doubt about carrying

701
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,120
seed algorithm

702
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,159
in bisep on the outers

703
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,480
mentioned the next slide please

704
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,399
so at first few words about this drought

705
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:55,279
in general

706
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,519
so it was written

707
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,919
to to describe today how we will

708
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,600
encode and send prefixed algorithm

709
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,640
between pcc and pc because uh algorithm

710
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,840
is available on

711
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,880
pc or pcc but there was no way to send

712
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,279
it

713
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,480
between them and the

714
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,279
draft is covering two main errors the

715
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,640
first part is about

716
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,039
encoding prefixed algorithm in ero hops

717
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,679
that is achieved by adding new knight

718
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,320
types

719
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,360
um inside of the erl

720
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,480
with algorithm field included there is

721
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,120
no

722
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,320
no new change uh signs last i death

723
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,720
so i will not spoil as i do not spend

724
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,600
more time

725
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,640
on this particular thing and

726
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,080
i will describe more

727
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,600
more details about second part uh

728
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,200
second part is about about encoding of

729
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
algorithm constraint

730
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,519
basically specifying specifying which

731
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,399
prefixes

732
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,039
can be used in part computation for a

733
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,559
specific

734
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,000
exam policy i'll get back to

735
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,720
details in later slider or in next

736
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,440
slides

737
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,320
next slide please

738
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,440
so currently there are two algorithms

739
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,480
defined

740
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,600
in sr architecture rfc spf and state

741
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,720
spf and also a range of ids

742
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,679
allocated for for example but definition

743
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:30,880
of this algorithm is

744
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,399
out of scope of this draft and this is

745
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,240
this leaves this kept just as a

746
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,440
reference to indicate

747
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,679
what kind of values can be used inside

748
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,880
of the algorithm field

749
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,239
next slide please

750
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,519
now to describe two changes which

751
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,240
happened

752
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,000
uh after last it's based on comments

753
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,120
so the one flag was i moved

754
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,240
the f flag a fallback flag uh

755
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
because there were two flags which were

756
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,679
almost same or which

757
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,079
had almost same inning and because of

758
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:08,879
that it was

759
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,480
confusing uh some people and

760
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,040
it seems to be added so we decided to

761
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,079
remove it and keep only one which was

762
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:20,800
probably more

763
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,159
more more important

764
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,639
and yeah that was the actual change

765
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,159
in dlv for lsp object uh

766
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,839
next slide please

767
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,359
then second part is about about

768
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:40,480
clarification

769
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,639
based on based on comments on last

770
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,079
directive and also

771
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,079
based on comments which are done after

772
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,599
after the itf

773
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,879
so uh basically seed algorithm of digit

774
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,159
exchange or which is

775
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,480
discounting this graph is not replacing

776
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,918
objective function

777
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:03,839
uh objective function rfc

778
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,520
because the the specified algorithm

779
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,640
is is just used for filtering

780
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,760
of all the prefixes uh during the part

781
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,560
computation

782
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,520
but it is not there for uh it is not

783
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,000
there for

784
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,720
for

785
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,680
uh it is describing which seats can be

786
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,560
used

787
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,640
uh during particular rotation it is not

788
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,160
describing algorithm

789
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,040
to to find them so it is not replacing

790
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,440
objecting function

791
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
uh and also we explained some details

792
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
about the l flag usage

793
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
actually the last flag which was

794
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,359
mentioned in the

795
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,960
last slide as well so uh if that flag

796
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
is not used then algorithm can be

797
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,200
considered as end-to-end algorithm

798
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,000
because no seats with other other

799
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,200
algorithm can be used

800
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,839
and there are some questions also about

801
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,520
loop avoidance so basically with

802
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,800
current current version of the draft

803
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,079
the loop we are not avoiding

804
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,839
the loops so basically it is

805
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,880
it is up to implementations to avoid

806
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,720
them

807
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,200
um i know that there are some comments

808
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,920
so

809
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,200
if we can actually discuss it after

810
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,320
after on next slide so um

811
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,839
next slide please

812
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,280
so if there are any any other comments

813
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:55,119
any any questions feel free to ask

814
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,839
any comments

815
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,440
uh samuel there were a lot of questions

816
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,400
uh uh

817
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,200
during the last meeting so based on your

818
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,160
previous slide

819
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,760
can we conclude that all of them have

820
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,320
been resolved

821
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,839
yeah i try to discuss all of them

822
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,280
uh at least inside between the authors

823
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,359
but if there is anything which is not

824
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,440
covered and or if there is any open

825
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,280
question

826
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,560
and feel free to ask again or i know

827
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,520
i i can cover anything or i can discuss

828
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,000
with

829
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,839
other authors anything that was not

830
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,839
covered

831
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,520
uh i think maybe we can uh take that to

832
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,119
the list and get a confirmation

833
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,680
from uh folks who asked the comments

834
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,119
looking at the minutes

835
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,960
uh from the last meeting that would be

836
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,560
the best way forward

837
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,720
yeah yeah sure if there is really

838
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
anything what we forget to update

839
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,599
in the world but what is not clear or

840
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,520
explained in the draft itself

841
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,640
then just feel free to open

842
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,960
or to open any discussion in the mailing

843
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,560
list

844
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,520
uh i do have uh one comment uh which i

845
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,320
will hold it

846
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,680
uh uh for the next presentation and let

847
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,760
the author present the said verification

848
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,000
and that we can discuss after that

849
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,160
so just hold on to that if there are no

850
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,760
other questions maybe we'll move to the

851
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,480
next presentation

852
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,720
i'm not seeing anyone in the queue so

853
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,359
ran

854
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,560
hello everyone can you hear me

855
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,160
yes sean go ahead okay thank you

856
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,440
hi everyone i'm from zte today i would

857
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,320
like to do

858
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,119
the presentation about pcep extensions

859
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,000
for seat

860
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,440
verification for sr npis next please

861
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,920
yes this is for motor reasons a

862
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,400
draft experience segment routing policy

863
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
describes the seed verification bait

864
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,079
uses

865
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,040
safe verification is performed when the

866
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,760
height end

867
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,520
is explicitly requested to verify seat

868
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,599
by the controller while the signaling

869
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,560
protocol used

870
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,480
implementations may provide a local

871
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,720
configuration option to enable

872
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,400
verification on a global or poor policy

873
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,720
of pro-canadian past species i've rc8664

874
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,440
specifies existence to the pcep

875
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,200
that allow a success state for pce

876
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,240
to compute and initiate t path

877
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,680
as well as a pcc to request a past

878
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,200
subject to certain constraint constructs

879
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,520
and

880
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,200
optimizations criteria in sr net

881
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,799
net network

882
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,400
because there is no draft that is more

883
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,839
relevant to the to this function

884
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,040
this draft is a supplement to fc

885
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,520
8664 uh

886
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,400
it's a and this draft

887
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,760
pro proposes proposes

888
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,000
to define a new flag for indicating the

889
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,839
hand and is explicitly requested

890
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,839
to verify state by the pce

891
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,480
next please

892
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,079
yes this is for the

893
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,920
pcep existence there are mainly

894
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,440
two accessories the first is

895
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,119
we extended the wavelike siero

896
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,440
sub object for indicating the pcc

897
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,040
is explicitly requested requested

898
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,640
to verify it by the pce and

899
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,680
the second is we extend it with like

900
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,800
srro sub object the format of the

901
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,920
sro sub object is the same as

902
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,200
that of of the sr ero

903
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,440
sub object but without the l flag

904
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
for fc 866

905
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,800
the way flag has no meaning in the srro

906
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,400
and is not as ignored as we see it

907
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,240
on the pce next piece

908
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,839
yeah this is for next step we would like

909
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:38,240
to

910
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,359
request a review and feedback from the

911
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,040
working group

912
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,000
that's all thank you

913
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,200
uh mike go ahead mike go ahead

914
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,839
mike uh can you unmute yourself

915
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,440
uh hi yeah i think something's wrong

916
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
something went wrong with the audio

917
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,359
um yeah i just had a quick uh question

918
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,720
uh so you defined this flag at the level

919
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,760
of the

920
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,280
ero sub object

921
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,680
i'm wondering if that's the right

922
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,960
place to put this flag like do you

923
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,839
really need

924
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,640
this fly you know to to to have that

925
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
much granularity

926
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,720
to say that you want to verify you know

927
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,160
each individual

928
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,319
you know say verify this hop but not

929
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,200
verify

930
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,640
the next hop but verify maybe the

931
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,560
next hop after that or do you want

932
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,400
this flag to be just applicable to the

933
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,920
whole

934
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,839
segment list or the whole candidate path

935
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,200
yeah thank you mike you know the reasons

936
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,680
for

937
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,880
this in yao or ro

938
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,839
because we would like to align with the

939
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,839
contentions of draft

940
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,960
pce srv6 and the draft pcp

941
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,200
isa policy for uh for pce srv6

942
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,160
it describes with bit is carried in yao

943
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,280
and for pdp as a porous draft it

944
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,560
describes

945
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,640
repeat is carried in segment sub troa

946
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,079
yes we can discuss so

947
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,440
i'm not sure okay that yeah that's fine

948
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,000
yeah thanks yeah thank you

949
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,480
yeah thanks mike uh uh yeah i quickly

950
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,480
checked for the idr uh

951
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,520
also defines it per set uh

952
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,720
so one looking at the document ran

953
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,960
one thing would be in the ina section

954
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,839
please uh

955
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,119
use tdb don't uh put the value

956
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,160
uh don't squat on a code point please uh

957
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,480
avoid that even in a early draft we

958
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,920
should come avoid uh

959
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,680
allocating it ourselves that's the job

960
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,599
of the ina so please use tdb

961
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,960
i hope my comment was clear

962
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,520
and the one related part yeah and the

963
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,440
second point which i wanted to make was

964
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,280
uh looking at the minutes from one zero

965
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:27,920
nine

966
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,200
uh i made the uh this idea of having

967
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,480
this v flag

968
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,839
based on the update that was done for

969
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,880
srv6 and

970
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,200
and i think the authors uh between the

971
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,480
two documents

972
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
decided that it's better that we

973
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,240
maintain them separately that is have

974
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,200
said i'll go

975
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,599
which is only about algorithm and keep

976
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,880
the verification

977
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,960
as a separate but one thing what we want

978
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,079
to avoid is

979
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,680
uh make sure that while we are doing

980
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,000
this activity that anything that is

981
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,960
missed between

982
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,000
uh bgp sr policy and psep if there is

983
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,720
any flag

984
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,440
any other things that missed out then

985
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,760
let's fix that once for all rather than

986
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,520
doing it at like you know one document

987
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,680
by one document and adding load

988
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,640
uh unnecessarily so i would request the

989
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,400
authors of the both documents if they

990
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,440
can

991
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,839
discuss this with the idr authors as

992
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,000
well and do a thorough check

993
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,119
that everything gets aligned between

994
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,280
the psep and idea would that be

995
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,400
something that you

996
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,119
and samuel and other people who can do

997
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:31,280
that

998
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,359
okay thank you thank you dov yes i will

999
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,000
fix it and we'll discuss with ideol's

1000
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,200
authors thank you

1001
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,160
thank you thank you

1002
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,960
samuel go ahead

1003
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,839
it just did there are some vocals also

1004
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:54,400
post

1005
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,640
about merging some of these graphs also

1006
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,800
with a multi-part

1007
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,119
graph

1008
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,680
object and we can potentially uh

1009
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,839
match some of these these

1010
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,640
this new attitude into other tables

1011
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,839
object as well but

1012
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,880
yeah it depends on specifically which

1013
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,319
may be missing in the future

1014
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,680
okay uh my request would be that merge

1015
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,079
is one part and another part is like we

1016
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,599
do a proper check

1017
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,319
as well with the idr document and make

1018
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,280
sure that we are

1019
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,359
aligned if there is any other flag or

1020
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,040
any other thing that's missed

1021
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,280
let's do an exercise on the mailing list

1022
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,480
and make sure

1023
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,920
that the alignment is there yeah

1024
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,119
makes sense thank you thank you thank

1025
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,720
you

1026
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,920
thank you thanks fran thank you

1027
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,560
yes thank you

1028
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,160
so next we have mike again uh for

1029
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,720
multipath

1030
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,880
um yeah so this is a draft for

1031
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,680
signaling psap extensions for for

1032
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,160
signaling multipath information

1033
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,839
i'll be presenting on behalf of the

1034
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:17,440
authors

1035
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,319
next night please

1036
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,240
so to give some recent updates in

1037
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,000
version three and four there were

1038
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,599
kind of very minor uh editorial changes

1039
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,960
and in version five we added uh support

1040
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,839
for candidate

1041
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,839
or sorry for composite candidate path

1042
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,359
signaling

1043
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,920
which was something that was added as

1044
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,359
part of sr policy

1045
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,839
architecture next slide please

1046
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,440
so this composite candidate path was

1047
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,280
introduced recently

1048
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,720
in the spring work group and it allows

1049
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,680
basically

1050
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,680
an sr policy candidate path

1051
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,800
to to send traffic

1052
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,000
to other policies on the same head end

1053
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,920
and so here i give an example of

1054
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,119
of two candidate paths

1055
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,240
under the same policy and one of them is

1056
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,640
composite and the other one is just

1057
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,160
regular explicit

1058
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,560
candidate path so

1059
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,480
[Music]

1060
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,559
cp200 the top one is the composite one

1061
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,760
and cp 100 the bottom one is a regular

1062
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,040
explicit candidate path

1063
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,480
um so as you can see like they look very

1064
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,440
similar

1065
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,359
the only thing that's different is

1066
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,839
that a normal candidate path has

1067
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,119
a bunch of labels

1068
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,599
as in the segment list and this

1069
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,000
composite candidate path

1070
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,599
has a collar so it has like a pointer to

1071
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,559
another

1072
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,599
policy on the same head end

1073
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,000
other than that basically the the two

1074
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,119
concepts are

1075
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,760
or the two data models i should say are

1076
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,319
identical

1077
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,200
next slide please

1078
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,599
so just to make sure like everybody you

1079
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,200
know understands what this

1080
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,640
how this composite candidate path works

1081
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,000
i give an example here so we have

1082
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,920
basically three policies

1083
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,280
on the same head end we have p one

1084
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,640
p p2 which are just regular

1085
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,599
policies and they're labeled green and

1086
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:50,079
blue

1087
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,480
respectively and we have p100

1088
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,319
which is this example policy that i gave

1089
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:01,599
previously and

1090
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,559
this p 100 contains a composite

1091
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,440
candidate path

1092
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,720
and so as you can see um

1093
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,960
the composite candidate path labeled in

1094
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,200
red

1095
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,720
instead of pointing to a segment list

1096
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:26,319
it points to one of it points to

1097
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,160
these two child policies p1 and p2

1098
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,760
via their colors so it says like uh

1099
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,800
weight one sr policy color one

1100
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,280
right and weight two as our policy color

1101
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,480
two

1102
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,760
so the color uh is enough

1103
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,119
for the head end to figure out uh

1104
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,880
the child policy

1105
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,800
and um so when the traffic

1106
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,839
hits uh policy 100

1107
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:04,160
if candidate path 200 is active

1108
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,280
then it's gonna do weighted ecmp based

1109
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,920
on w1w2

1110
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,400
into the policies p1 and p2

1111
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,960
and those policies are going to take

1112
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,400
their traffic

1113
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,880
and again ecmp it based on their own

1114
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,400
weights into their segment lists

1115
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,640
so it provides kind of a very powerful

1116
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,640
you know way to uh

1117
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,558
to steer traffic um next slide please

1118
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,160
so the signaling for this uh we

1119
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,480
kind of went with the simplest possible

1120
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,240
approach is we reused

1121
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,680
a color tlv

1122
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,880
from this draft

1123
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,599
pct constraint so it just defines a

1124
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,760
colored tlv

1125
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,240
and we put this color tlv

1126
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,040
into the path attribute object

1127
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,359
to basically mean that

1128
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,720
this um

1129
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,359
segment list within the candidate path

1130
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,720
is basically pointing to this color

1131
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,000
and we if in that case we require the

1132
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,400
srero to be empty because

1133
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,520
because it's not using actual labels as

1134
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,240
the output

1135
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,559
it's using a color

1136
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,760
so yeah we're kind of open to

1137
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,880
other ways to signal this

1138
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,040
we can discuss it in more detail

1139
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:01,520
on the mailing list or here

1140
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,079
but basically all we need is to say that

1141
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,480
to you know to say that there's a color

1142
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,280
and the rest remains the same

1143
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,160
next slide please

1144
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,880
yeah so we will wait for work group

1145
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,680
adoption

1146
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,040
and we can discuss

1147
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,480
i'll leave some time for question

1148
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,200
answers thanks

1149
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:42,160
thanks mike any questions

1150
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:45,680
uh pawan uh would you like to uh

1151
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,680
uh talk about your question that you

1152
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,200
posted on the

1153
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,160
uh on the chat

1154
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,640
hi uh this is biram juniper uh it wasn't

1155
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,920
more of a question

1156
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,359
uh there are currently a couple of uh

1157
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,960
documents that do define the color tlv

1158
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,079
uh originally i think for sr paths

1159
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,160
when we we thought just putting it in

1160
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,599
that external association

1161
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,839
association id would be sufficient but

1162
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,880
uh as you can see

1163
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,520
there are use cases where we do need uh

1164
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,200
explicit tle to be there

1165
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,200
uh yeah my i was just pointing out that

1166
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,599
there are already two documents that

1167
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:25,920
propose it we need a single placeholder

1168
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,640
and

1169
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,400
the authors of the two documents will

1170
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,040
sync up and make sure that happens

1171
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,680
thank you pablo

1172
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,680
uh one more point uh would be that like

1173
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,119
the working group should also think

1174
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,079
whether tlv is the best way forward

1175
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,319
there are some other solutions as mike

1176
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,920
was also suggesting

1177
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,960
i think the implementers prefers tlb

1178
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,000
and that's completely fine but let's

1179
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,880
discuss this

1180
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,799
and resolve on the list

1181
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,359
yep sounds good

1182
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,240
and uh just a reminder that this is next

1183
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,040
in line for

1184
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,200
our working group adoption as well so

1185
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,559
start reviewing

1186
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,000
and handling those things

1187
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,960
right now thank you thanks

1188
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,200
okay so let's move to the next section

1189
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,839
which is stateful pce

1190
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,480
related documents and pcc related

1191
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,040
documents the first one that we have

1192
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,079
is native ip boris

1193
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,760
yup hello everyone

1194
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,799
i'm boris hassanov so today uh on behalf

1195
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,200
of

1196
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,640
our crafters i will deliver short update

1197
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,119
about

1198
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,079
psf extension for native ip network

1199
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,880
next slide please

1200
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,520
very shortly uh observation why do we

1201
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,240
need it

1202
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,160
this is uh most important part in whole

1203
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,359
solution for implementing pc for native

1204
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:05,920
ip

1205
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,720
network currently we have two other

1206
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,599
documents

1207
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,720
rfc 8755 which describe

1208
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:17,040
different scenarios of such solution and

1209
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,760
most important some simulation results

1210
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,520
which was

1211
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,720
done we also have india's

1212
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,400
working group group pcn 85 pm

1213
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,359
architectural draft which is now in rfc

1214
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,559
editor queue

1215
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,799
and this document describes the

1216
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:35,839
practical

1217
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,119
part of whole architecture and

1218
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,839
about psep extensions which are needed

1219
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,040
for it

1220
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,839
next slide

1221
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,200
thank you so very short recap of

1222
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,720
solution itself we have a native ip

1223
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,680
network

1224
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,880
where we do not have mpls lsp

1225
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,000
recpt or srsrv6

1226
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,280
based transport but we have pc

1227
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,599
which we want to implement to optimize

1228
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,480
traffic steering in this network how can

1229
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,319
we do it with

1230
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,200
by means of pc we can calculate optimal

1231
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,680
path

1232
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,760
between ps and can provision

1233
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,760
multiple bgp sessions on p routers

1234
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,640
and also route reflectors depending on

1235
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,839
the scale

1236
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:33,520
of a network we can also provision

1237
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,960
a mapping between prefixes and

1238
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,160
and next hopes which will be used so

1239
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,079
which bgp session we will use

1240
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,119
for particular traffic so by means of

1241
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,480
that we can steer traffic

1242
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,680
in different paths and by using

1243
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,119
different bgp sessions

1244
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,160
so all of this can be accomplished by

1245
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:00,319
help of pc and psep extensions

1246
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,440
please next slide

1247
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,440
so basically what do we have here

1248
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,880
we have an update about

1249
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,640
capability advertisement modification of

1250
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,079
existing precept messages we introduced

1251
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,200
new psep objects and obviously euro

1252
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,000
types

1253
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,359
and also very briefly touched

1254
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:30,400
procedures how it will work overall and

1255
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,599
some considerations for operations

1256
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,839
next slide please

1257
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,760
so most important we have to advertise

1258
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,960
capability for using pc and 85p

1259
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,319
and we can do this by introducing new

1260
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,400
policy type type capability tv

1261
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,160
where new pst which will be defined

1262
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,079
later on

1263
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,880
shows what pcc and pc are capable to

1264
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,480
support this implementation

1265
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,920
also according to pce ccc psap extension

1266
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,559
draft

1267
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,359
we also use pce ccc capability subtly

1268
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,720
but we want to add additional flag about

1269
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,000
native ip capability additionally to

1270
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,520
l flag which introduces pcc capability

1271
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,720
next slide please

1272
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,640
so in terms of precept messages

1273
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,160
we follow rfc8281

1274
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,880
pce initiated model so we have

1275
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,240
modifications for pcm initiate

1276
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,160
message by adding three new uh

1277
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,839
objects where uh basically

1278
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:00,480
uh they are mentioned here uh bgp

1279
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,680
peer information explicit road

1280
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,480
information and basically ppa object

1281
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,720
which we are using for cessation

1282
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,640
prefixes and next hope

1283
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,960
and same objects will be added also to

1284
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,000
puff computation update message as

1285
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,480
mentioned here

1286
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,599
uh next slide please

1287
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,960
so we also will

1288
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,040
uh reuse uh cci central contour

1289
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,400
controller indication object

1290
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,040
from my pc cc pc extension draft

1291
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,960
uh because obviously we rely on

1292
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,880
pcc model where pce will uh

1293
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,720
program our native ip

1294
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,760
let's say let's call them routers in our

1295
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,960
network so

1296
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,960
cci uh object will be also reused

1297
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,480
in uh in our solution

1298
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,200
uh basically most important here what we

1299
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,559
will use symbolic

1300
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,160
path name tlv which should be included

1301
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,440
to this object as sort of anchor

1302
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,280
to our pc objects

1303
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,160
next slide please

1304
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:27,599
bgp rn4 object

1305
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,040
is used to program our routers

1306
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,760
to let them know how to set up how to

1307
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,119
build bgp session and

1308
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,839
with whom so basically as you can see we

1309
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:38,559
have two

1310
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,000
uh two types of objects for ipv4 uh rfe

1311
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
and ipv6

1312
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,839
and basically we provide uh

1313
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:51,040
we instruct our p router which look back

1314
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,160
use for particular bgp session which

1315
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,480
all loopback use for particular bgp

1316
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,720
session and which remote

1317
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,319
ip address of remote bgp neighbor is

1318
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:06,559
used to setup a bgp session

1319
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,359
next slide please

1320
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,359
explicit perrot object is basically used

1321
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,280
for creating sort of traffic engineering

1322
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,559
uh like approaching native ip network

1323
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,480
uh when we want to use a specific

1324
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,839
uh path to steer with traffic to use

1325
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:32,480
specific

1326
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,880
microscope specific interface for

1327
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,319
particular bgp session

1328
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:41,839
next slide please

1329
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,000
and basically we also should explain to

1330
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,799
our routers as i said

1331
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:53,680
my opinion between prefix and

1332
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,839
prip address for bgp session how

1333
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:02,480
like which bgp session will be used for

1334
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,559
steering traffic to reach ip v4 or ipv6

1335
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:07,440
prefixes

1336
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,640
so that's why we need this bpa object

1337
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,879
here

1338
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,720
a format is also described

1339
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,920
uh next slide please and obviously we

1340
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,240
will need additional or new euro type

1341
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,640
and hero values

1342
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,920
for such approach like if we have some

1343
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,559
errors with not much

1344
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,839
after after normal system numbers or

1345
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,319
ip address can be reached etc etc

1346
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,839
some issues with bgp session etc

1347
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,319
services

1348
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:47,359
current list of such hero types and hero

1349
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,440
wells which could be used

1350
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,359
for to help operations team to recognize

1351
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,799
what what's wrong

1352
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,440
or what's wrong happened with particular

1353
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,640
traffic uh steering in in this solution

1354
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,039
uh next slide a very short

1355
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:15,440
update recap about procedures

1356
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,440
so basically we have some network with

1357
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,119
native ip based no mpls no sr as i

1358
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,319
mentioned here

1359
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,119
but we have sdn controller or network

1360
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:28,240
controller

1361
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,359
with pc functionality which support

1362
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,400
walls additional

1363
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,039
extensions

1364
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,480
when we want uh to build particular

1365
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,280
buffer traffic steering our controller

1366
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,079
sends uh

1367
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,880
p submission messages to

1368
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,400
routers for example r1 r7 if we have

1369
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,240
quite big network we also could use

1370
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,000
route reflex

1371
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,559
for programming sessions not for full

1372
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:01,359
mesh

1373
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:05,359
not for full bgp mesh but only for

1374
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,839
bgp session towards particular route

1375
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,920
reflector

1376
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,119
this psap message will have

1377
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,319
bgp info object

1378
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,760
with unique symbolic path name tlv

1379
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,880
which i mentioned earlier that could be

1380
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,839
used for

1381
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:26,240
either identification symbolic

1382
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,319
identification a constant

1383
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:32,079
identification of this particular path

1384
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,520
so according to these instructions

1385
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,960
which pcc will get from pce we will

1386
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,079
build

1387
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:45,599
those multiple bgp sessions

1388
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:51,119
next slide please

1389
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,000
after that uh in in previous slide uh if

1390
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,160
we will use only bpi obviously to reach

1391
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,319
bgp next hope or ip address of our

1392
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:18,319
bgp reviews

1393
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:20,319
engineering like approach we will also

1394
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,480
construct our routers

1395
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,720
by means of explicit payroll object

1396
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,160
when we will provision uh

1397
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,359
from pc uh explicit

1398
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,240
path uh we will provision how to reach

1399
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,680
particular

1400
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:43,038
bjp next scope by which particular

1401
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:47,280
interface or ip route most important

1402
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,160
thing

1403
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,040
here is to what such

1404
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,239
[Music]

1405
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,480
such information such instruction from

1406
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,960
pce should have

1407
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:02,720
highest priority when

1408
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,119
versus existing for example static roads

1409
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,480
configured on on our routers to

1410
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,720
make them more preferable

1411
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,520
next slide please

1412
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,160
and last step in

1413
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,160
such solution is provisional

1414
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,880
instruction from a controller from pc

1415
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,520
about

1416
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,359
which prefixes which prefixes will be

1417
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:33,839
mapped

1418
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:38,640
to which bgp sessions so for this

1419
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:43,839
purpose we will use ppa object

1420
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,160
and this is final step in whole

1421
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,359
procedure after that

1422
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:51,359
routers will know like how to reach

1423
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:54,240
how to build bgp sessions session and

1424
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,119
with whom

1425
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:58,720
uh how to reach this particular bgp

1426
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,599
next hope either by means of igp for

1427
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:02,160
example

1428
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,200
uh shortest path or by means of sort of

1429
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,520
traffic engineering like explicit route

1430
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:08,480
and

1431
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,079
which prefixes uh traffic for which

1432
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,559
for which prefixes will be used in this

1433
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:15,599
particular

1434
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,399
bgp sessions like how how traffic

1435
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,479
steering will work so this is final step

1436
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:25,839
um next slide please

1437
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,399
so from operations point of view we

1438
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,920
tried to summarize

1439
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,960
uh some important things

1440
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,560
of practically important things

1441
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,679
so the purpose is to have a purpose of

1442
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,520
this solution is

1443
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,960
built lightweight programmable bgp

1444
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,080
session setup

1445
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,279
and explicit road deployments and

1446
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,799
traffic steering obviously this

1447
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,880
will require additional work for

1448
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,880
planning

1449
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,560
for example back address planning

1450
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,759
and distribution so everything

1451
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,640
should be done in advance and it

1452
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:11,439
obviously

1453
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:14,960
will require careful playing

1454
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,120
all other things which are mentioned

1455
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,000
here were pretty

1456
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,679
much similar to our pc

1457
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:25,600
based solutions like state

1458
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,759
synchronization

1459
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:33,198
uh mentioned here obviously if

1460
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,000
one of the routers will fail by some

1461
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,080
reasons pce should detect

1462
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,319
this and recalculate apology

1463
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,880
and topology as it's described in

1464
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,238
architectural drive

1465
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,520
should be derived to controller by our

1466
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,440
means for example bgp link state

1467
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,000
and if we have opposite case

1468
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,480
when a router will

1469
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,600
have some issues to connect pc

1470
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,800
or pc will go on

1471
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,920
also do some fail or etc etc

1472
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,920
so during such time this provisioning

1473
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,600
information

1474
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,440
will be kept in stale state

1475
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,040
until pce will return back

1476
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,440
and we also should make sure what

1477
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,760
pce will take in account

1478
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,520
possible loops in our network

1479
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,800
to exclude because now we have just ip

1480
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,800
forwarding

1481
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,480
it's also a possible issue

1482
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,159
so we have to take care about this

1483
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:53,679
uh that's all uh and finally so we will

1484
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,440
appreciate commence feedback

1485
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,559
to prepare to

1486
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,880
are there any questions for boris

1487
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,239
boris one thing which is missing is

1488
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,920
first of all thank you for adding this

1489
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,920
operational consideration but similarly

1490
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,199
we should uh

1491
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:20,480
add a section which is impact uh on bgp

1492
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,320
or what what is the things that we would

1493
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,080
like to get an opinion

1494
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,320
uh from the idea working group and we

1495
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,080
need to coordinate with them yeah and

1496
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:28,880
get

1497
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,960
reviewed as well so maybe you can start

1498
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,239
working on that

1499
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,320
i see the security consideration is also

1500
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,920
empty so i think that's

1501
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,239
uh something to worry about there are

1502
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,400
impacts to security here

1503
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,679
highlight one more item

1504
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,880
which i think is the name ppa which

1505
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:49,199
stands for fear prefix

1506
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:52,159
association and as you know in psap we

1507
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:54,080
use the association object and it's

1508
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,640
pretty

1509
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,719
overloaded with multiple association

1510
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,320
types so

1511
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,880
if you can think of maybe finding a term

1512
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:01,520
that

1513
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,760
doesn't use association i think that can

1514
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,719
also help

1515
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,120
and avoid confusion later yeah okay yeah

1516
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,000
i got your point

1517
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,679
that's it from my set thanks for working

1518
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,199
on this document

1519
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,000
thank you roof thank you everyone uh any

1520
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,600
other comments on this otherwise we'll

1521
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,159
move to the next

1522
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:26,639
okay let's go to into domain

1523
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,280
olivier

1524
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,080
yes i can hear you go ahead okay thanks

1525
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,360
hello everybody

1526
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,640
so this is a brief status on

1527
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,840
extensions for interdimensional

1528
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,199
state full setup so the goal of this

1529
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,880
draft is to ease

1530
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,920
coordination between pc

1531
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,159
spawn in different domain to set up

1532
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:03,280
tunnel and to stitch them in an

1533
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,520
independent way without requesting any

1534
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,719
additional signaling that is

1535
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,800
mostly not set up or forbidden

1536
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,560
between carrier between bgp routers

1537
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,760
and uh in addition to to leave each

1538
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,719
carrier

1539
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,280
free of the where they are in force

1540
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,840
returned so we could stitch

1541
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,600
mpls rsvpt and pls segment routine

1542
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,679
channel for example

1543
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,719
so um this is an update since the

1544
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:37,760
working group

1545
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,640
adoptions and thankfully everybody that

1546
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,360
supports

1547
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,640
the draft so the version zero zero

1548
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,760
is just the following working group

1549
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,719
adoption and this lattice version of

1550
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,320
individual draft

1551
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,440
and we upload version 01

1552
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,840
which take into account the comments

1553
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,560
receive

1554
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,320
during this working group called

1555
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,880
adoption except the comment about the

1556
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,640
implement options

1557
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,679
which is the discussion for for today

1558
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,640
and that we aim to solve

1559
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,239
with the feedback from the working group

1560
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,440
before producing version zero two so

1561
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,560
next slide please so

1562
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,960
um in terms of implementation

1563
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,000
requirements

1564
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,480
uh the stitching label principle

1565
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,440
required

1566
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,040
at least a certain number of

1567
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,560
modifications in the current

1568
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,920
p-sub-version

1569
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,600
at least we need a new pc capability

1570
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,000
to announce the inter-domain behavior

1571
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,280
between

1572
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:46,239
pc and also between pc and pcc

1573
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,719
so this is in term of implementation

1574
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,840
to request a new code point for this pce

1575
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,120
capability we need also

1576
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,640
a new pc association group because

1577
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,760
from a pc point of view

1578
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,840
you have to manage to associate

1579
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,120
inter-domain

1580
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,640
tunnel so you have local tunnel

1581
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,480
which is enforced in the domain this pc

1582
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,719
is controlled but also because this pc

1583
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:26,000
is discussed with this neighbor pc

1584
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,600
to to continue to pronegate the

1585
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,920
interdimensional we need to associate

1586
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,120
the different parts

1587
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,840
in order to have something consistent in

1588
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,040
particular

1589
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,840
from a management point of view when we

1590
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,880
would remove

1591
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,719
fertile we would update this

1592
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,159
entertainment channel

1593
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,520
or if a pcc or a pc reboot

1594
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,480
and we need to reassociate the different

1595
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,239
local part so

1596
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:56,320
again this need a new

1597
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,480
look at point for for the association

1598
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,840
group then

1599
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,199
we need to have some new pc pc error

1600
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,280
message of course to to manage for

1601
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,360
stitching level exchange

1602
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,280
and now we need also a mechanism to to

1603
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,400
convey

1604
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,440
the stitching label itself and there is

1605
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,120
many

1606
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,400
possibilities and we request

1607
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,880
uh help from the working group to to

1608
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,840
choose

1609
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,679
between several options and adapt

1610
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,920
the best of one so next slide please

1611
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,120
so what are the technical solutions and

1612
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,920
we we identify at least three uh three

1613
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,679
different options the first one

1614
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,440
is the one which is uh in the current

1615
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,960
version of a draft it associates uh

1616
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,440
explicit root object and a recall root

1617
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,239
object

1618
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,560
in conjunction with a new path setup cut

1619
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,360
point

1620
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:56,799
to exchange this

1621
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,960
stitching level so it's teaching label

1622
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,320
is part of ero

1623
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,000
and arrow and the pst

1624
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,239
allow pc to request an inter domain path

1625
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,280
to a pcc

1626
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,960
or a neighbor pc so

1627
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,880
it's a simplest in term of

1628
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,000
implementation because

1629
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,960
it just knew cut point on existing

1630
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,000
object

1631
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,560
but as mentioned by drew during the

1632
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,679
working group

1633
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,239
called adoption each time a new path

1634
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:28,159
enforcement appear

1635
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:30,719
a new pst code point must be allocated

1636
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:31,360
and

1637
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,080
typically it will be the case with a new

1638
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:34,400
uh

1639
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,760
srv6 or segment routine v6

1640
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,760
where we need again a new pst so

1641
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,920
perhaps not the best solution

1642
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,040
the second possibility is again to use

1643
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,000
this ero

1644
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,640
and ero but in conjunction with a new

1645
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,480
flag

1646
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,480
in the lsp object so

1647
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,960
it is as simple as the psd cut point

1648
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,719
but we need to use the new lsp extended

1649
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,520
flag sub object because

1650
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,480
the current flag in the sp object are

1651
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,239
all of the flags

1652
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:17,440
are used and so we need to to go to this

1653
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,800
lsbx and flag sub-object which have been

1654
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,120
recently adopted as a working group

1655
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:24,719
draft

1656
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,440
and there is some alternate solution uh

1657
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,239
was

1658
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,480
where we could try to to find another

1659
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,760
place for the

1660
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,840
flag for example the srp or lspa

1661
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,880
object and the third

1662
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,040
option is to define a new psap

1663
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,480
sub-object tlv within vlsp to convey

1664
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,679
explicitly the stitching label so

1665
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:52,000
we avoid to use explicit root object and

1666
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,120
recall boot object to convey this

1667
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,320
teaching level so

1668
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,679
perhaps it's more independent

1669
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,000
and because we explicit explicitly

1670
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,640
convey the stitching level so

1671
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,480
perhaps we could avoid some error when

1672
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,920
a pcc in particular pcc will convey the

1673
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,560
arrow and

1674
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,840
error it could

1675
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,000
be more secure

1676
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,520
i mean it will be more independent

1677
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,880
because uh

1678
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,960
courier will not have to exchange some

1679
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,120
ero or ero

1680
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,920
between pc they just exchange this

1681
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,560
stitching level

1682
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,679
but this needs extra parting in the

1683
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,360
preset grammar

1684
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,640
from an implementation point of view and

1685
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,159
just to to finish next slide i try to

1686
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,880
to elaborate a bit more of his third

1687
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,239
option

1688
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:56,480
by proposing a first attempt

1689
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,880
for a new stitching label sub-object

1690
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,560
where we could convey

1691
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:03,600
the stitching level itself for 20 bits

1692
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,560
of course

1693
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,760
and some flag and also the possibility

1694
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,040
to to carry the traffic class so

1695
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,480
that could be of interest if for example

1696
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,760
we we could manage some deserves

1697
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,080
continuity between carrier

1698
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,320
where the tsc could be

1699
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,199
exchanged if we have some agreement

1700
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:28,880
between carrier

1701
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,040
and also the possibility to to specify

1702
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:37,120
if we stitch or if we nest

1703
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:41,840
the path between two to carrier

1704
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,760
so the mic is open

1705
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:48,880
to to get your feedback i've

1706
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,679
also start a thread on the mailing list

1707
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:52,800
to to discuss

1708
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,960
this this point and i think it's very

1709
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,520
important to to collect

1710
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,280
feedback from working group before going

1711
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:03,600
to

1712
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,199
to to version zero two will

1713
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,880
change the implementation

1714
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,000
option or for for this inter domain

1715
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,360
stateful thanks

1716
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,480
thanks olivia any questions any feedback

1717
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,440
on these three options

1718
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,840
hurry go ahead

1719
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,159
uh hurry we can't hear you can you

1720
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,638
unmute

1721
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,400
ah can you hear me now yes okay

1722
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,679
the question is like why the second

1723
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:47,840
option is considered as a con is in like

1724
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:50,719
using a space standard object is uh seen

1725
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:51,600
as a

1726
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,679
uh negative thing it's a it's a good

1727
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,199
thing right so

1728
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:58,080
it's an lsp external object tlv and you

1729
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,080
can use it

1730
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,080
i don't know it's uh it's not um

1731
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,360
when i uh i tried each time to to find

1732
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:07,679
pro

1733
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,199
and cons and finally the only

1734
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:14,880
concern is that using this

1735
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,239
extended lsp flag sub-object

1736
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:21,520
is that we just need to synchronize the

1737
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,960
the two draft and that

1738
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,080
the lsp extended flag sub object

1739
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,199
must be adopted first and

1740
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:35,120
implement first before this one could be

1741
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:38,480
adapted and implemented so it's more a

1742
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:39,360
constraint

1743
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,880
in term of dependence

1744
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,760
from an overdraft in term of

1745
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:48,400
implementation

1746
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:53,839
okay thanks

1747
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,520
uh any other feedback

1748
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,080
uh thanks olivia to start the thread so

1749
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,679
far i'm the only one who has

1750
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,920
provided any inputs i request others in

1751
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,120
the working group

1752
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:06,800
to provide their thoughts like which is

1753
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,719
the best uh way forward

1754
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,960
and so that we can make some progress

1755
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,159
here

1756
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:15,520
okay thanks uh only regarding the third

1757
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,719
proposal that you have

1758
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,120
uh that is uh maybe you can add a

1759
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,719
pointer to that so that people can

1760
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,480
understand this a little bit better

1761
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,600
maybe you can even put the

1762
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,080
link to this presentation so that people

1763
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,760
can understand the third option

1764
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,960
a little better okay okay i will add it

1765
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,440
thank you

1766
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,840
next we have giuseppe for ifit

1767
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,679
well lord can you hear me yes go ahead

1768
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:51,679
okay um hello everybody this is an

1769
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:53,040
update about the

1770
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:57,120
psap extensions for effect

1771
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:03,840
we are at 202 version on next live

1772
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:08,800
yeah just uh some words about background

1773
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,960
and motivation my feet refers to data

1774
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,080
playing

1775
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,880
uh on path telemetry techniques in

1776
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:16,080
particular inbound ram

1777
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,320
and as passive performance measurement

1778
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,600
technique we can mention

1779
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,080
we can consider alternate markings and

1780
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,360
you can also see the

1781
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,880
reference documents for this

1782
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:30,080
techniques the psat extension

1783
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,320
that we we are defining in this document

1784
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,800
allowed to signal the effect

1785
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,080
capabilities

1786
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,080
this is valid for all part type so

1787
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,760
in the latest version we have

1788
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,679
generalized uh

1789
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,880
this application so the tlvs that we are

1790
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,719
defining here

1791
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,280
can be encoded can be carried inside the

1792
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:56,960
lsp attribute subject object

1793
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,960
and can be applied for all part types

1794
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,560
are of course as long

1795
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,239
as they support the relevant data

1796
01:25:02,239 --> 01:25:04,239
playing telemetry method

1797
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,718
so next

1798
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,239
yeah in this slide want we are going to

1799
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:13,600
summarize the

1800
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,639
name change from 0 1 to 0 2 version of

1801
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:18,560
this graph

1802
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,719
we got some input from mike about the

1803
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:25,600
the possibility to consider the case of

1804
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,520
different active methods

1805
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,440
for each segment list okay we didn't

1806
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,320
consider but

1807
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,120
it's something that is possible to do

1808
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,360
since

1809
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,400
the ift attributes tld that we are

1810
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,600
defining

1811
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,920
can be added for example into the path

1812
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,120
attribute object

1813
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:48,480
as also previously discussed by mike

1814
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,000
instead of the lspa object and we added

1815
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,639
a short paragraph in the latest version

1816
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:55,280
to

1817
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,320
highlight this possibility in addition

1818
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,040
another change

1819
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:04,239
was related to the addition of alternate

1820
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:06,239
alternate marking mode so

1821
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,440
the possibility to see now the hop by up

1822
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:09,679
or

1823
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,239
end line measurement and also it was

1824
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,280
updated the

1825
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,360
reference to the companion dolphin 19

1826
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,760
idr that has been adopted

1827
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,639
so next

1828
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:25,760
yeah the first thing is about the ifit

1829
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,920
capability advertisement that

1830
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,199
of course we need to advertise

1831
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:34,639
the acid capabilities and redefine

1832
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,960
the tld that you can see with the five

1833
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,080
flags

1834
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,360
that are according to the

1835
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,080
embankment and the ultimate marking

1836
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,840
related document

1837
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,960
of course the flag must be sent

1838
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:51,840
by both pcc and pc in order to support

1839
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,679
the distantiation

1840
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:56,560
so next slide

1841
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,239
yeah this is about the ift tlv that

1842
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:05,360
provides

1843
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,800
the knobs of the i5 feature

1844
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,679
as i said it can be included as a tlv in

1845
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:12,639
the lspa

1846
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:16,560
object and

1847
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:20,080
the iptlvs are optional

1848
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,480
and can be taken into account by the pc

1849
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,360
during path computation and by the pcc

1850
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,120
during path setup of course this can be

1851
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,080
also applicable

1852
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,440
to dsr policies and in this case

1853
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:36,880
this this pld's also complement the pc

1854
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,239
segment loading policies

1855
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,559
next

1856
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,320
in this slide we are going to details

1857
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,600
the

1858
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,040
difference of the lvs these are the

1859
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,080
subtleties for institution so

1860
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:57,840
you can see all the four options

1861
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,239
the pre-allocated incremental directory

1862
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,239
export and that stretch

1863
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:04,559
next

1864
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,280
yeah this is the other sub will be

1865
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,840
related to alternate marking

1866
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,840
and you can see the new fields that we

1867
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:12,960
have added about

1868
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,400
the the hope by off the signaling of hop

1869
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,360
by up

1870
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,880
or end-to-end measurement

1871
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,440
so next

1872
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,840
yeah as i said as an example in the

1873
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,199
draft we

1874
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:33,679
added some consideration about how this

1875
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,880
draft complement the pc segment ruling

1876
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,679
policy

1877
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:43,040
graph in pc in particular

1878
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,000
we added reference to the relevant

1879
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,120
operation

1880
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:50,080
uh already described in the draft and in

1881
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:54,320
particular for pc initiated lsp the

1882
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,679
if the fit feature is enabled the ifit

1883
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:01,040
lv must be included in the lsp object

1884
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,840
in the pc initiate message after the

1885
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,120
installation the

1886
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:10,239
successful instantiation of the lsd

1887
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:12,880
of course the methods can be applied

1888
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,920
based on the corresponding data plane

1889
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,320
uh methodology and you can see also the

1890
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,600
reference

1891
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,920
of the relevant document about data

1892
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,120
plane

1893
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,760
to enabling disabling or changing some

1894
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,320
features

1895
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,520
the some features of the ip

1896
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,159
the attributes tld must be included in

1897
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:32,800
the

1898
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,159
pc update message

1899
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,760
next

1900
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,480
yeah in the final slide so we welcome

1901
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,000
question comment and

1902
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,560
we also have to consider the working

1903
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,280
required option

1904
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:53,840
are there any questions

1905
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:07,840
boris go ahead

1906
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,599
boris we can't hear you

1907
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,960
oh sorry um do you plan

1908
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,560
to add implementation or interrupt

1909
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,000
section later on

1910
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,270
uh yeah it's something that we can

1911
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:32,480
[Music]

1912
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:35,360
we can consider

1913
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,800
thank you for keeping the documents

1914
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,360
aligned between the idr working group

1915
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:52,560
and the pce so in the past we have had a

1916
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,000
problem so i see that like you know the

1917
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,760
updates that you have made here

1918
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,719
are well aligned with idr so thanks for

1919
01:30:58,719 --> 01:30:59,679
doing that

1920
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,800
uh one comment related to uh the

1921
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,080
eam where you have added the uh

1922
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,360
some new flags uh would you want to also

1923
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,440
create a ina registry for this

1924
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:13,760
or for some reason we don't want to i

1925
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,360
want you to understand

1926
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,960
uh the r part i believe is reserved bits

1927
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,159
and you are using

1928
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:23,280
h and e as a fixed set of flags

1929
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:26,560
uh do we want to do a like make a

1930
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,320
registry for this or do you want this to

1931
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,440
be a fixed

1932
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,638
set of flags and why

1933
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,760
yeah i think we will we would like to

1934
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,560
have a fixed

1935
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,920
set of flags because yeah

1936
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,080
we are working together also to other

1937
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,800
data plane documents and in that

1938
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:47,520
document

1939
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:49,920
there are two possibility to use

1940
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:51,120
alternate marking that

1941
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:54,800
are hoped by operant one so

1942
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,360
considering that for example in srv6 you

1943
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,080
can use

1944
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,199
hot buy up option or destination option

1945
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:04,719
it's better to have these flags

1946
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:08,800
that are similar in order to

1947
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,639
to choose the right option

1948
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:15,679
for the data plane

1949
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,120
okay because most of the other

1950
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,040
subtleties we are simply saying that the

1951
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,920
flax fields are as defined in the iom

1952
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,120
document

1953
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:27,440
only for this one we are defining them

1954
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,480
inside psep

1955
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,560
and idr i just wanted to make sure

1956
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:32,480
that's a conscious choice and if

1957
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,760
whether are you able to justify why this

1958
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:38,080
should not be allowed to be extensible

1959
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,040
uh using

1960
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,239
like you know simple code point

1961
01:32:40,239 --> 01:32:43,839
procedures that we usually follow

1962
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,080
so just something to think about uh and

1963
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:48,719
we can discuss more on the list

1964
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:52,320
yeah yeah so thank you for your work

1965
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,760
okay let's go to the uh next one which

1966
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:56,639
is

1967
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:01,760
operational clarification mike

1968
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,000
yeah hi i'll be presenting a quick

1969
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,199
update to this

1970
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:12,320
psap operational clarifications draft on

1971
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,239
behalf of the authors

1972
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:17,120
next slide please

1973
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:22,320
yeah so the recent update is just

1974
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,080
basically on the

1975
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:28,159
srro object use in segment routing

1976
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:31,120
next slide please

1977
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,880
so the original psep

1978
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:42,080
ro object is taken from rsvpt

1979
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,400
it's in it's kind of directly uh you

1980
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,400
know encoded

1981
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,239
in rcpt the ro is optional

1982
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:53,360
meaning that if

1983
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,600
if your tunnel you know doesn't or if

1984
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,560
your lsp doesn't

1985
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,880
specify a record route then

1986
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,920
the lsp can still uh be established

1987
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,960
but record route just provides extra

1988
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:10,000
information

1989
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,280
about the path like uh label recording

1990
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,480
and uh it's used for uh node protect

1991
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:19,760
for selecting uh the the node

1992
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,639
uh for figuring out the merge point

1993
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:25,040
label basically

1994
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:29,120
the label at the merge point uh so

1995
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,040
in our in psap we kind of um

1996
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,480
we you know when we defined the sr ero

1997
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:40,800
object we uh kind of

1998
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,080
you know in parallel defined srro

1999
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,480
and i don't believe there was any kind

2000
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,520
of

2001
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,320
uh known purpose at that time for why

2002
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,679
we're doing it but

2003
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:55,679
it was just um to kind of

2004
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,639
try to maintain like parody with rcpt

2005
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,480
um and so we kind of have this srro

2006
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:07,840
object and it's not clear you know

2007
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,199
how it should be used um

2008
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:14,480
and so it was found in like the vendor

2009
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,519
implementations that

2010
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:22,400
mo that people were not using it

2011
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,679
at least in in our testing

2012
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:29,280
so for srte it is enough to just use the

2013
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:33,119
sr ero there's no

2014
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:37,440
real need to have like the exact same

2015
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,840
you know object with the exact same

2016
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:43,199
content by just using you know a

2017
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,599
different

2018
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,360
object type so we propose to

2019
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:55,880
kind of only use srero

2020
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,880
srv6ero

2021
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:02,639
at least until we figure out

2022
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:08,719
a better use for this srv srro

2023
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:14,000
so yeah that's basically the update um

2024
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:17,760
if there's any you know comments

2025
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,040
oh sorry next slide please

2026
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,600
uh yes we would like to request work

2027
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:27,199
group adoption for this draft

2028
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,239
and if there's any comments i would like

2029
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:31,760
to leave time for

2030
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,800
q a thanks

2031
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,040
are there any comments for mike

2032
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,880
uh by uh regarding the feedback on the

2033
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,239
rro uh one use case would be that if you

2034
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,280
remember uh

2035
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,119
we allow uh nai only

2036
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,280
as an option that pc can compute the

2037
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,600
path but doesn't give the label stack

2038
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,400
it can only give the it can carry the

2039
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:02,880
path

2040
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,000
in nai without allocating the sets and

2041
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,520
the pcc could

2042
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,920
pick this uh sets i know most of the

2043
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,920
implementation don't implement that

2044
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,119
maybe that's why we never saw anybody

2045
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,119
uh using it is that could be the reason

2046
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,199
maybe more investigation is needed on

2047
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:20,159
this

2048
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:22,159
uh but i believe that that option is

2049
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:23,520
allowed by the

2050
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,560
sr ero right because you have

2051
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,840
the exact same you know nai and uh

2052
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,880
all this stuff like uh this f

2053
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:35,920
and okay so your uh

2054
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,719
the thinking in my in the idea what i

2055
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,320
had was that maybe ero

2056
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:43,360
is supposed to be the path that pce

2057
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,239
selects and if uh like you know based

2058
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:46,480
and

2059
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,679
if that is nai only maybe it will remain

2060
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:50,719
an ai only

2061
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,760
and in the sr rro uh the actual

2062
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,040
translation

2063
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,400
uh with uh with the label plus this

2064
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,560
should be done that was what i was

2065
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,159
thinking i'm also not sure

2066
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:05,199
that is ever mentioned in the rfc so a

2067
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,199
clarification is definitely needed

2068
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:09,920
but whether it is that we should not use

2069
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,119
or we clarify

2070
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,520
what is the place we should actually use

2071
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:14,960
and where we can ignore it

2072
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,840
could be uh something to think about uh

2073
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,280
andrew i think you have

2074
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,440
uh some thoughts on this as well go

2075
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,599
ahead

2076
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,639
um yeah i just i actually didn't think

2077
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:28,719
or heard of that before so that's a

2078
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:31,360
certainly an interesting use case of iro

2079
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:32,320
just to add to it

2080
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,560
the text as proposed in this operational

2081
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,679
document doesn't explicitly prohibit ro

2082
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:39,440
it's simply saying that as we've seen

2083
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,280
you know with previous implementations

2084
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,000
that

2085
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,320
most vendors are not reporting an ro

2086
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:45,440
probably because like as you mentioned

2087
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,199
we're not actually implementing that nai

2088
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:48,639
functionality

2089
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:51,199
um so it's not necessarily prohibiting

2090
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:52,000
it

2091
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,440
it does have a wording that says you

2092
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,199
know it may carry it however it

2093
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:57,600
might be basically excluded therefore

2094
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,199
you know you should be treating the euro

2095
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:02,480
as an arrow kind of situation

2096
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,959
understood

2097
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:10,400
yeah in like rsvpte right the rro

2098
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,920
object is is very specific like it has a

2099
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,159
very specific purpose right it's

2100
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,960
something that you send uh you know in

2101
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,000
the path message

2102
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,400
and then you get back in the resv

2103
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,040
message

2104
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,320
with uh you know the labels

2105
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:29,600
the recorded labels and a bunch of other

2106
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:31,760
stuff

2107
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,280
so like to assign it this extra meaning

2108
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,960
of um

2109
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:41,840
you know this extra meaning for srt it

2110
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,719
requires

2111
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,719
at least some special

2112
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:50,080
uh kind of statement you can't just so

2113
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,679
so i'm okay with like uh you know adding

2114
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:55,440
if we can find some kind of a meaning

2115
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,679
for it then that's perfectly fine with

2116
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,119
me

2117
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:02,239
uh go ahead

2118
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:06,159
uh in terms of modeling the paths right

2119
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:06,880
i mean

2120
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,400
at least the approach we typically take

2121
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:10,639
is there is a intended path and then

2122
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:12,960
there is the actual path that's used

2123
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,239
uh and we have typically used the rro to

2124
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:17,840
reflect the actual path

2125
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,679
uh if if ever there is a difference

2126
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,080
between what is the internet path in the

2127
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,880
actual path you do need to uh two

2128
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,239
separate parts

2129
01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:29,520
uh i i mean i i believe i mean

2130
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,199
operationally like i agree with mike

2131
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:32,719
that there's probably

2132
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:34,800
no such instance but there are i mean

2133
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,080
you never know you there will be

2134
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,600
instances where you push down something

2135
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,040
in the arrow

2136
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:43,920
but when you program it may be different

2137
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,839
with one example

2138
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,320
but it's kind of that kind of divert

2139
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,920
that was my point is that this kind of

2140
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,040
diverges from the original rsvpte

2141
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:58,719
uh meaning of rro right which is not

2142
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:02,880
really like the rro basically is a

2143
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,880
record route right so it's basically

2144
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,080
it doesn't necessarily mean that you

2145
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,840
signal it it just means that what is the

2146
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,719
actual

2147
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:11,520
recorded route and it's fully optional

2148
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,080
right so

2149
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,199
yeah i'm not sure uh when when i believe

2150
01:41:17,199 --> 01:41:18,880
most implementations when they

2151
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,360
uh are sending the reports it's the rro

2152
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:22,480
that's used right

2153
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,159
isn't that uh you're not saying you just

2154
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:26,960
we just uh

2155
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,159
report the ero and not the rro yeah at

2156
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:30,800
least for

2157
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,040
for us we we don't we only report the

2158
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:34,560
ero

2159
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,960
i think andrew has some comments there

2160
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,960
go ahead andrew i've seen different

2161
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,159
vendors like nokia

2162
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,800
reports both euro and narrow but

2163
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,480
essentially it's an echoback

2164
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,320
but i've seen other vendors only report

2165
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,520
the euro

2166
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:54,480
now like saying it's essentially it's

2167
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,080
it's a pointless kind of data structure

2168
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,600
right because it's just an echo back in

2169
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,440
the current implementations

2170
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,040
but i definitely agree with them that

2171
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,639
yeah if there's any differences in the

2172
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,719
euro and ro then it does have value

2173
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,000
signaling

2174
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,320
um this text is mainly just to say that

2175
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,159
hey this is just what's been observed

2176
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:11,679
operationally and

2177
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:13,040
you know to continue to interrupt we

2178
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:15,600
need to make sure that

2179
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,600
the behavior of processing the euro and

2180
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,000
ro and treating the differences between

2181
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,520
you know a signaled and requested path

2182
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:23,440
versus actual path is at least

2183
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:26,480
described thanks

2184
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,639
okay thanks uh i think we are over time

2185
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,199
on this one

2186
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,159
thank you folks

2187
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:39,920
okay so uh why move uh

2188
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:43,119
you are next yeah can you hear me uh

2189
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:44,320
yeah whoever can you

2190
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,400
uh try to finish in eight minutes that

2191
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,719
would be really yeah okay

2192
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:50,639
thank you thank you hello everyone today

2193
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,400
i'm going to present pc

2194
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:57,839
for vit pass thanks page

2195
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,880
so for pc to support a bat path

2196
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:05,600
so we we should have a pc connected to

2197
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,800
the age of the domain

2198
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,080
domain and also the uh

2199
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,719
for example pca is connect to the age of

2200
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,159
the

2201
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:18,639
right cloud and then this pca will also

2202
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:20,080
connect to another pc

2203
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:23,199
such as pcb so pcb

2204
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:26,719
will is for a domain which contains uh

2205
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,920
market source a normal procedure for

2206
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,960
creating a

2207
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,000
bfpe path is that the equals node will

2208
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,320
soon

2209
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:37,840
report to the pca and then i'm joined to

2210
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:41,199
multicast tree and then after pca

2211
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:44,320
receive this kind of uh eagles join and

2212
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:44,960
then

2213
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,679
pca will try to find the english node

2214
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:52,159
for broadcast three and then pca will

2215
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:54,000
send the

2216
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,719
request to pceb for computer equals node

2217
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,000
pcb will reply equals node to pca

2218
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,800
and mpca have all the information about

2219
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,119
the tree english node and the user.pta

2220
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:10,480
will compute paths after the computer

2221
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,080
path it will encode the path

2222
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,520
using beat position or vip pass and then

2223
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,639
send this path to english node

2224
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:21,520
so after receive the uh this information

2225
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:22,480
a linguist note

2226
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:25,199
will set up a path and then send the

2227
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:26,800
report message to pca

2228
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,960
and then pca will record this this

2229
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:30,639
message so this is a

2230
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:34,480
one a sequence of steps

2231
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,000
for creating a pc uh creating a

2232
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,600
ba td path next page

2233
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,840
so this is basically more uh application

2234
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:46,639
scenarios

2235
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:51,760
so another scenario is that pc pass may

2236
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:55,199
be a t pass may change for example when

2237
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:57,679
one of the existing equals node may just

2238
01:44:57,679 --> 01:44:58,719
leave

2239
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:02,800
the tree so after pca receiving this

2240
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,199
updated information it will recompute

2241
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:06,080
the uh

2242
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,360
new path and then send it this new path

2243
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,320
using uh maybe update message to the

2244
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,199
english node

2245
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,520
so english node after receiving this new

2246
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,360
path will replace

2247
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,920
the older path with this new path and

2248
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:20,960
then send the

2249
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,159
report message to the pce and then pc

2250
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,520
will record this

2251
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,040
information so another

2252
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:32,480
uh application scenario is that pca

2253
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:36,400
they just receives requests from a user

2254
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,280
and then user will give more information

2255
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:40,239
such as

2256
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:43,119
english and the equation notes and then

2257
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:45,840
pca will just compute

2258
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,480
p two uh brt pass and they encode the

2259
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,360
pass using b

2260
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,360
position and then send this class to the

2261
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,560
english node and then

2262
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,119
english node will set up a path and then

2263
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,360
send the report to the pce

2264
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:00,159
the next page

2265
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,480
so you want to support the uh bf

2266
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,960
vip pass and then we need to have a

2267
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,360
number of extensions to pce

2268
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,080
first we need the exchanges to number of

2269
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:12,639
pc

2270
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,560
objects such as we will we will have

2271
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:19,600
to support capability and then

2272
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:23,440
extension to sr p and then

2273
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:26,159
a new english node object and then

2274
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,080
object new object functions for

2275
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:31,280
this special bft path

2276
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,719
and then v8 pass objects

2277
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:37,119
and then with these object extensions

2278
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:39,040
and then we will also extend

2279
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:42,080
a number for p7 messages

2280
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,719
such as report messages and update match

2281
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,320
in this match and the request

2282
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,159
and the reply messages on the you

2283
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,920
disagree that we have a number of

2284
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,719
procedures

2285
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,840
to operate the ba

2286
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,480
next page

2287
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:00,960
so this is more details about the

2288
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,000
extensions first we need to have a

2289
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,080
capability exchanges between pc speakers

2290
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:11,600
so we should have

2291
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,920
passed set up a type tlv so this tv will

2292
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,199
contain as special type which is for

2293
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:22,000
brte pass and in addition to that we

2294
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,520
have a subtle v

2295
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,360
that shows you with with this this psp

2296
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,440
so this subtlety will contain

2297
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,480
information

2298
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:34,000
about what's the size of the si

2299
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,880
dude and then what's the size of a bit

2300
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,239
string

2301
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:40,879
next page

2302
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:47,199
so the extension to srp like we have

2303
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:51,760
so this srp will contain those

2304
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,600
past setup type with a new psp

2305
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:58,639
in addition to that we define

2306
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,840
three contiguous bit flags

2307
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:04,560
so these three bit flags will be used

2308
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,360
defined

2309
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,320
as system operations so we define three

2310
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,440
objections

2311
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:13,040
such as join multicast group or source

2312
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,920
and then leave from multicast group and

2313
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,639
source

2314
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,920
and then ingress node computations

2315
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,480
next page

2316
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,199
so in addition to that those are uh

2317
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:29,280
extensions to srp srp

2318
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:33,199
and then we define a new tlv

2319
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:37,199
we call the multicast traffic pov or

2320
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,920
multicast traffic information tvs so

2321
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,440
basically this trv

2322
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,679
will contain the information about

2323
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:45,520
market traffic

2324
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,040
that the path will be carrying so

2325
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,400
this tlp will contain multicast

2326
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:55,679
group address prefix or

2327
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:59,520
and or multicast source address prefix

2328
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,800
so we have two types of multicast at

2329
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,560
marcus group address prefix and

2330
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,520
multicast source address y is for ipv34

2331
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:15,760
another is for ipv6 so next page

2332
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,000
so this is uh for ip multicast google

2333
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:20,480
address

2334
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,280
prefix one for ipv4 and another for ib

2335
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:30,400
physics next page so we have a

2336
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,360
multicast source address prefix one for

2337
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:34,639
ipv4 and

2338
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:38,639
one for ipv6 next page

2339
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,119
so we also define a new object we call

2340
01:49:43,119 --> 01:49:43,679
the

2341
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:46,320
english node object so this object will

2342
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:46,880
be used

2343
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,719
when we i know my pce computer english

2344
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:52,080
node and the input node will be

2345
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,199
represented by

2346
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:56,159
one of this object so we have two object

2347
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,480
type one is for ipv6 and another is

2348
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:01,679
available so in addition we also define

2349
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:05,119
object especially for a bft path

2350
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:08,719
so we need that because for pf we have

2351
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,480
different objectives so we so

2352
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,520
why is the minimum be the size and

2353
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,080
that's why

2354
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,960
the minimum bit is the distance so next

2355
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:21,280
page

2356
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:24,000
we are out of time so maybe let's take

2357
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,280
questioning run

2358
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,800
yeah it's done almost done you'll go

2359
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,960
nice page thanks for that just

2360
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:34,000
almost down here yeah this is more

2361
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:34,719
details

2362
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:38,880
yeah we'll go conclude questions yes

2363
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,599
run go ahead

2364
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,080
thank you for your work and we have

2365
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:01,440
submitted the pce brt draft

2366
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:04,719
in 2015 and

2367
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:07,920
it is now in the working group

2368
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,199
adoption queen please refer to

2369
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:14,320
the pcc weekend and

2370
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:17,040
please review it and any comments are

2371
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,960
welcome

2372
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,000
yes that's a good question i refer

2373
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,119
your document in the in my draft

2374
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:29,840
so basically that draft just

2375
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:32,880
suggest or propose a very minimum

2376
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,520
of exchanges basically focus on

2377
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:40,960
the step uh the subject there's a

2378
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,159
vip pass ero

2379
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:46,639
sub object i think that's what i

2380
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:49,360
mentioned i would describe it

2381
01:51:49,360 --> 01:51:52,560
to that yeah whoever i think whoever the

2382
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,400
main concern here would be that you

2383
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:56,480
should build on the existing rather than

2384
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,599
redefinition

2385
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:00,000
so currently pst and some of the things

2386
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,440
we are redefining

2387
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,280
in your document for that you should

2388
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,719
refer to the existing

2389
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:06,239
document and whatever you think is

2390
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,159
missing that's the thing that you should

2391
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:09,440
add in your

2392
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,199
anyway we are out of time so let's move

2393
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:17,839
to the next presentation thank you

2394
01:52:18,159 --> 01:52:21,199
gyan you are next

2395
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:25,520
hi thank you hi my name is gion mishra

2396
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,520
i'm with verizon and i'm providing an

2397
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:29,440
update for pset ls

2398
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,080
psap extension for distribution of link

2399
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:32,719
state

2400
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:37,119
and te information next slide

2401
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,800
so with this update what i'd like to do

2402
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,040
is um the goal is to really

2403
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,360
kick off the update the uh discussion

2404
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,880
again on the mailing list so

2405
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,480
there has been a lot of discussion in

2406
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,480
the past so we would like to just kick

2407
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,840
this off again

2408
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:54,080
and you know positioning this draft as

2409
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,040
experimentals

2410
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,159
so with that a very quick recap so the

2411
01:52:58,159 --> 01:52:59,760
use of psep to learn

2412
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,239
the network topology state technology

2413
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:03,599
and state

2414
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:06,000
applicable to device to controller as

2415
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,360
well as controlling the controller so

2416
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:08,719
hpce

2417
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:10,880
complementary extension so this is

2418
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,040
basically another tool so

2419
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:15,119
the the doors that has been open we have

2420
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,040
other options in the operator's toolbox

2421
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:17,679
so

2422
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:19,440
um you can think of this as really just

2423
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:21,280
another another tool in the operator's

2424
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,440
toolbox we have bgpls and netconf and

2425
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,400
now we've now

2426
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,719
with this pc psf ls just provides

2427
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:27,599
another option

2428
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,239
that we can take advantage of enabling

2429
01:53:30,239 --> 01:53:32,159
to use a single protocol

2430
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:34,239
single control plane vertical as an sbi

2431
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:35,679
in some scenarios

2432
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:39,119
a new pset message

2433
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:43,040
ls uh capability tlv i would piece up

2434
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,639
object type and reuse the tlb is already

2435
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:47,360
defined

2436
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:49,280
defaults is local only remote learn

2437
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,280
information can be enabled

2438
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:54,880
next step next slide so as a reference

2439
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,040
a rough summary of where we left off on

2440
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,159
the mailing list

2441
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:01,199
so uh so basically we all know this the

2442
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:03,199
presence of other ways to do this you

2443
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:03,679
know

2444
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:05,920
and some consider them better um

2445
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,679
comparing so what we want to do is we'll

2446
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:08,880
look at all you know look at

2447
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:11,760
how often just keeping the door open

2448
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,239
versus comparing one versus the other

2449
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,080
we just want to keep keep an open mind

2450
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:17,599
and just yeah you know

2451
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:21,119
look at this as really another option or

2452
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,440
you know with the operator and they're

2453
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,199
in the operator's toolbox to uh

2454
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:28,360
utilize um for for certain use cases uh

2455
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:29,920
p-sub-scalability worries

2456
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,400
operational complexity does this require

2457
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,119
multi-vent

2458
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:36,400
vendor interop interoperable rc's

2459
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:38,400
so some of the uh questions that have

2460
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:42,080
come up in the past on mailing list um

2461
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:45,119
consensus on use of psep has sbi

2462
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:48,320
uh in some pcc centralized controller

2463
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,119
scenarios

2464
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,199
there's a direct pcf session with the

2465
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,639
nodes leverage

2466
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,320
leveraging the direct piece obsession to

2467
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,239
also learn the topology and changes

2468
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:58,080
it's a you know can be an attractive

2469
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,280
option uh

2470
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,760
usefulness and hpc inner domain model

2471
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,840
for interlayer optical et cetera

2472
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:05,760
uh another tool so that's a big one

2473
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,280
another tool in the toolbox

2474
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,440
for operators so we're not replacing

2475
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:11,119
anything and and so there's

2476
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:13,280
we don't want to go go down the road of

2477
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,599
you know comparing one versus the other

2478
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:17,119
we're just saying that this is really

2479
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:18,880
another option that we're

2480
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,960
you know giving the operator to pick and

2481
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,880
choose you know based on use cases

2482
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,119
uh or what can be used uh for instance

2483
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,480
we recognize

2484
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,960
that that some may want to use yang path

2485
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:30,960
for you know computational rpc instead

2486
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,400
of psap

2487
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:34,320
in both scenarios and we support all

2488
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,000
approaches so we're we're completely

2489
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,520
open we're not saying one way or the

2490
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:37,920
other

2491
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,920
we just want to keep that door open and

2492
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,119
this is just another

2493
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:44,840
option in the operator's toolbox next

2494
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:46,639
slide

2495
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,639
some use cases and scenarios where a

2496
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:50,719
piece of ls is an attractive choice

2497
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:54,960
so so pcf pcc centralized control sdn

2498
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:55,679
model

2499
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:58,080
um some use cases require direct

2500
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,239
pre-subsession so all nodes we're using

2501
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:02,159
that same session to also learn global

2502
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:04,320
network state is attractive so we

2503
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:06,400
already have this the session is there

2504
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:08,800
uh why not reuse we use that uh piece

2505
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,440
obsession

2506
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:12,719
for vgpls tlp uh

2507
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:14,800
so sorry pizza fellas enable the

2508
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,080
possibility of an sbi

2509
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:19,199
um protocol for for some use cases um

2510
01:56:19,199 --> 01:56:22,719
hpce for inter domain model uh between

2511
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:24,480
controls for boundary nodes as part of

2512
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,040
the

2513
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:28,000
the abstract domain topology and then

2514
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,199
partial so this is

2515
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:31,360
this is important that we we're not

2516
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,960
saying really we want to say

2517
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,639
you know using piece of ls for the

2518
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:36,960
entire solution we can have a hybrid

2519
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,480
model so partial

2520
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:41,920
um solution so you we can use a variety

2521
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,320
you know

2522
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,800
the other options that are available in

2523
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:46,239
the operator's toolbox it doesn't have

2524
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:47,040
to be just one

2525
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:49,280
or another so some information such as

2526
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,440
optical extensions learn via piece of ls

2527
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,639
for fast learning

2528
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:54,400
reusing psep synchronization

2529
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,400
optimization techniques and incremental

2530
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,199
updates

2531
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:59,199
um and their other mechanisms can also

2532
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:00,639
coexist

2533
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:03,119
next slide

2534
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,880
so um the flow of information and

2535
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:07,599
control

2536
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:10,800
so on the left side we have the pset uh

2537
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,159
pce cc centralized sdn controller model

2538
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:17,840
so here we're reusing the sbi so the p

2539
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:20,560
the from the network elements uh using

2540
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,960
reusing the sbi for the pset ls

2541
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:27,040
uh the new uh uh ls capability tlb with

2542
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,400
the ls object type

2543
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,239
yeah in from gathering the infinite

2544
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:31,920
nation push pushed up

2545
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,960
towards the pcecc controller and then

2546
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,400
and then that save sbi on the right side

2547
01:57:38,400 --> 01:57:41,679
that are being used to uh push the state

2548
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,480
information updates and uh

2549
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,880
report and update messages pcc

2550
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,840
instructions

2551
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,239
down to the network elements on the

2552
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:51,280
right side uh

2553
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,679
diagram showing a um the information and

2554
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:54,400
control

2555
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:57,440
in the uh nras domain using hpc

2556
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,840
on the left side on the on the on the

2557
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:00,560
left here

2558
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,960
in the right diagram psf ls boundary

2559
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:04,400
nodes so this we have the network

2560
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,480
elements pushing up the um

2561
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:09,920
the psep ls uh capability tlv with the

2562
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,040
ls object

2563
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,880
helicopter types for link node and

2564
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,639
prefix pushed up

2565
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:17,199
from the from the pc the child control

2566
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:18,560
the chat piece

2567
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:21,440
the child pc up to the parent pc and

2568
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:21,840
then

2569
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:25,119
and then um that same sbi not being used

2570
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:26,400
for the rest of for hp

2571
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:30,719
the standard hpce um that's used today

2572
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:33,119
to push down the um report and update

2573
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:34,639
messages and synchronization on the

2574
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:35,920
right side pisa

2575
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:39,440
down to the uh network elements

2576
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,760
questions to the work group so what we

2577
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:43,199
want to see is is there enough

2578
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:45,599
interest by some in the workroom to work

2579
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:48,719
work on this song are there target

2580
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:51,280
experiments demos implementations

2581
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,520
uh so some were showcased in the past in

2582
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:54,639
hackathon

2583
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:57,679
and in bits and bytes some open source

2584
01:58:57,679 --> 01:58:59,520
implementations exist and documented

2585
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,920
some researchers researchers have shown

2586
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:02,800
interest

2587
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,639
and experimented some operators have

2588
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:06,639
shown interest as well

2589
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:08,960
is there a possibility of somewhat rough

2590
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,639
consensus or support

2591
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:14,000
for this as an experimental id

2592
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,679
some of the experimented results to

2593
01:59:15,679 --> 01:59:17,199
collect what would be the next step

2594
01:59:17,199 --> 01:59:19,440
so uh at this point i'd like to open up

2595
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:20,560
the floor for any

2596
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:22,639
any questions or comments or any uh

2597
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:23,760
related to this um

2598
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:26,239
document and moving forward um and

2599
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:27,840
trying to kick off the discussion

2600
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,159
on the mailing list positioning this

2601
01:59:30,159 --> 01:59:32,719
draft as an experimental draft

2602
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:35,119
thank you we have one minute so

2603
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:36,320
questions please

2604
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,040
mike go ahead

2605
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:42,080
uh personally like from cisco

2606
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:44,400
implementation we don't have much

2607
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:48,400
uh interest in this to be honest

2608
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:51,360
um because we already have bgpls which

2609
01:59:51,360 --> 01:59:51,840
works

2610
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:54,960
and you know if we go and implement this

2611
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:55,440
it

2612
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:58,639
it's uh you know there's always a lot of

2613
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:01,920
code churn you know that happens uh

2614
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,920
and so there has to be you know really

2615
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:05,280
good justification

2616
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:08,560
for you know doing something like this

2617
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,119
uh not just you know to say okay here's

2618
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:12,320
another way

2619
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,880
you know to do the same thing that that

2620
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,800
is already done

2621
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:19,280
um so yeah that's just my answer you

2622
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:20,000
know to your

2623
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,360
kind of poll thanks all right thank you

2624
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:26,159
thanks mike and does the use cases which

2625
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:26,480
are

2626
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:28,960
uh highlighted here does that uh like

2627
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,679
you know maybe

2628
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:32,960
uh if you are implementing pcc or hpc

2629
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,320
or doing interoptic uh inter uh optical

2630
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,239
uh ip plus optical would that be

2631
02:00:38,239 --> 02:00:41,839
something of an interest

2632
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:51,520
i haven't thought about about that but

2633
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,760
we would prefer to stick with you know

2634
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:56,400
with existing

2635
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:59,840
bgpls you know unless there is a clear

2636
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:04,560
case where something cannot be done with

2637
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,320
bgpls

2638
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:11,920
any other comments from the group

2639
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:15,440
uh otherwise we should take this to the

2640
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,280
list and continue the discussion

2641
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:20,400
uh julian we are out of time so maybe

2642
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:21,679
last words from you

2643
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:23,679
we are sorry for the last presentation

2644
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:25,360
we could not make time so julian go

2645
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,880
ahead

2646
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:28,960
yes so thank you everyone for this

2647
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,520
meeting on attending this virtual

2648
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,520
online gathering and that's the

2649
02:01:33,520 --> 02:01:35,119
opportunity to say our last

2650
02:01:35,119 --> 02:01:37,440
thank you to deborah it was a pleasure

2651
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:39,119
working with you so we hope you'll be

2652
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:41,599
able to meet again in the near future

2653
02:01:41,599 --> 02:01:44,800
thank you everyone thank you everyone

2654
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:45,840
bye-bye

2655
