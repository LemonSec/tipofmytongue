1
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
thank you jessica

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
very grateful jess

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,840
can get together what was that

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,160
a drink next time we're all together

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,440
that'll be a little while so it'll be

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:45,839
plenty of time for me to forget

7
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,680
okay should we get started

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,079
uh welcome uh everyone to the rats uh

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,239
session number two

10
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,160
and uh so i have uh i'm presenting the

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,359
agenda for today

12
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
um so we'll uh basically what we have

13
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,240
uh in store is uh

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,119
uh the uh eat adoption status uh from

15
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,320
lawrence

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
uh we'll take five minutes for that and

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,680
then we have an overview of the heat

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,960
profiles

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,840
topic uh lawrence is also on tap for

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,280
that one and then

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,840
third is a discussion about how coswood

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,159
and eat

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,159
go together and so uh we have we have

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,080
plenty of time allocated for that

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,119
so it really uh if there's

26
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,360
if if there's time i think we will try

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,479
and uh the trails will will

28
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,200
do an update a brief update on the

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,159
milestones

30
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
progress any other topics we need to

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
consider

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
if not then we will dive right in

33
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,399
so

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,119
lawrence i think you're you're up next

35
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
are you here

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
internet are we going to do milestones

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,680
too

38
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,038
or at the end at the end yeah okay

39
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,080
just not seeing it i don't have slides

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
so

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
i sent you one earlier oh okay all right

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,480
i'll try and

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,879
work on that during the talk then thank

44
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
you

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:37,839
okay let's see

46
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:50,000
you get to the right spot here

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,959
lawrence you're up

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,920
you're on mute lawrence

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
lawrence you're still on mute okay can

50
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,680
you hear me now

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
ah yes yeah okay separate for

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
video and audio okay next

53
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,120
next slide please

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,800
so uh this is the same slide from uh

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
last time um just a list of the things

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
that that

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
i'm i think

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,640
should be in uh eat the the the set of

59
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
claims that we should be

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,040
uh having you eat that that's kind of

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
the

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
in the eat draft that's the ones we want

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,959
to standardize for um

64
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,560
the the e draft um

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,799
can be lots of claims after this um you

66
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,480
know in the registry but this is the the

67
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,280
plan

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
what i'm planning for to complete the

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,599
draft

70
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,839
um next slide

71
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,239
so this is the status of uh

72
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,519
and progress on all of those

73
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,439
so we've had a little bit of progress on

74
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,200
uh

75
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,880
the hardware identification um

76
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
the uh then and it's it's nearly done

77
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
um i've had a little bit of progress on

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,440
gps location there was some refinement

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,040
there and i think it's nearly done

80
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,240
then the intended use claim was added

81
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,600
to the draft and the profile claim

82
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,320
was added to the draft that will i'll go

83
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,400
over today

84
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
um in some detail

85
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
then there was a bit of a few little

86
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,720
modifications

87
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,919
to sub modules and nested eats

88
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
and i think those are in pretty good

89
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
shape

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
um i have an implementation of

91
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,919
of of that and i think um

92
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,000
thomas was working on an implementation

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,479
of that um

94
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,080
then last time we talked about public

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
keys and uh

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,039
that was that's been added to the draft

97
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,400
um

98
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
so the the big areas where we have work

99
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,680
to be

100
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
there's where there's work to be done is

101
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,880
coast wood

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,560
measurements and then the

103
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,800
identifying the verifier input which is

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
endorsements and

105
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
key ids so we talked about

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,720
go to next slide

107
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,840
oh yeah and then there's um other than

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
work on specific claims i need i still

109
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,639
need to do a substantial

110
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
rework in relation to the rats

111
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,960
architecture so it uses the terminology

112
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,919
we want to say that heat can be used for

113
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,490
attestation results

114
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,639
[Music]

115
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,080
maybe some claims for attestation

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,400
results but i haven't really done any

117
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,440
work on that

118
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
i want to do some examples and then a

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,479
verification procedure

120
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,840
this is similar to what was

121
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,159
last itf next slide

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
so just just a short change a

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,720
list of changes um the ue ids are now

124
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
based on

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,360
uh the imei based ueids are now 14 byte

126
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,160
strings

127
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
um the sub modules uh

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,680
now a cwt

129
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,479
sub module is allowed in a jwt and vice

130
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,039
versa

131
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,199
and the the how seaboard tags

132
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,280
are to be used in a

133
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,680
like when you put a cwt module inside a

134
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
cwt module how the tagging works

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,280
um uh added that we

136
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
added the cryptographic keys in claims

137
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,000
uh added the hardware version claims

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
uh some some tweaks for uh

139
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
debug status um added the intended use

140
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,080
claim

141
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,440
there's improvements on the location

142
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
claim added the boot seed claim

143
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,880
um then there was a bunch of rework on

144
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,360
the seaboard interoperability section

145
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,560
and then

146
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,840
added profiles so uh

147
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
the a lot of the work to be done is as i

148
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,280
said um

149
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,120
on swids coast widths

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
and measurements and we'll get into that

151
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
later and then

152
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,759
there's also a fair bit of work to be

153
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,840
done on uh

154
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,679
endorsements and

155
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,479
key ids and most of that is going to be

156
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,440
just frame up i have a pull request on

157
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,000
that i don't

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,840
intend to actually define an endorsement

159
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,239
format

160
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,199
next slide

161
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,919
yeah so

162
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,080
we talked about verifier input um at

163
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
109 but nothing has happened since and

164
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,360
then

165
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,720
um nothing on attestation results and

166
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,199
measurements not really either um i

167
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,879
think i think i did put a pull request

168
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,800
out there but it's not very

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
developed so

170
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,880
that's it for status any comments and

171
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,838
questions on status

172
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,399
okay uh if not then

173
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,080
let's keep going next slide

174
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,680
so this is about the profile claim

175
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,719
uh next slide

176
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
so um

177
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
this is uh to me um

178
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,160
this is about actually getting to

179
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,800
interoperating uh implementations of eat

180
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
so the eat protocol or he describes uh

181
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,279
it's got a lot of options i mean uh

182
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,040
you know and these it has all these

183
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,959
options um

184
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,399
to work in lots of different

185
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,839
environments and lots of different use

186
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,560
cases

187
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,600
some of them have to do with you know

188
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
whether it's constrained device

189
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
um uh

190
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,360
are you using this on a constrained

191
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,959
device or are using this to report

192
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,920
results between

193
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
cloud services for example for the two

194
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
extremes something

195
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,880
and two things that are very different

196
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
so constraining device you want very few

197
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,080
claims very small

198
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
representation uh moving data between

199
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,279
cloud services you probably

200
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,079
are happy with that json and you might

201
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,640
have lots and lots of claims

202
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,320
um some of this optionality

203
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
is inherited from cos a and from cwt

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
you know for example kosei supports lots

205
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
of algorithms

206
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,600
and you need to

207
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
narrow down to pick you know one or two

208
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,079
algorithms or a set of algorithms

209
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,440
somehow

210
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
uh so you actually have interoperability

211
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
um in cwt claims are all the claims are

212
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,839
optional

213
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
there is no round trips in 8

214
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,920
so negotiation is not possible i mean i

215
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,839
guess you could add it but

216
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,720
in some form but we're not specifying

217
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
anything there

218
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,399
um so we have this this setup so that

219
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:50,959
that

220
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,279
two implementations of e uh may not

221
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,640
necessarily interoperate

222
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,560
one one could be using json with the

223
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,320
other seaboard they could have different

224
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
means of identifying the the

225
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,399
verification key signing algorithm

226
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
could they could choose different

227
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,560
signing algorithms they could in

228
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
choose different uh variants of sibor

229
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
encoding format

230
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,880
like a definite length versus indefinite

231
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,200
length

232
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
um so

233
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,359
yeah next slide

234
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
um so the eat profile the idea of an eat

235
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,839
profile is to

236
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,800
narrow the definition of eat and uh to

237
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
the point where you have guaranteed

238
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,360
interoperability

239
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,040
it kind of surprises me that uh

240
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,600
we don't do more of this particularly

241
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,320
around

242
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
um kozai and sibor

243
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
because uh like a lot this

244
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,320
the characteristics of the issues here

245
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
would arise for any protocol using cos a

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,160
and seabor and this is

247
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
itf so i think we are after

248
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,120
interoperability

249
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,200
um so i've gone a gone a fair ways

250
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,040
uh down the path here to um

251
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,519
recommend what should be in the neat

252
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,240
profile

253
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,079
we don't have any example lead profiles

254
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,320
yet but um

255
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,240
so what what the the text in the

256
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,920
document

257
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,000
does is list all the things that an eat

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,519
profile should

259
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,600
specify so any profile is

260
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
at this point it's a human readable text

261
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,719
document

262
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
it's not anything machine readable or

263
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
anything like that

264
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,639
it narrows the cwt

265
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
cos a and jwt options to result in an

266
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,880
interoperable protocol um the document

267
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
may be

268
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,040
either an iets standard or ietf

269
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,240
informational or such

270
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,399
it could be some other standard like

271
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,160
fido or vp

272
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,040
it could be vendor proprietary um it

273
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,240
could be private

274
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,800
um just being completely open here about

275
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,360
what

276
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,920
uh any profile document could be i mean

277
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,440
it could be in the set of documents or

278
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
you could even

279
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,880
a hierarchy of documents

280
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
there is a claim defined

281
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,519
any claim defined that names the profile

282
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,320
you can either name it as an oid or a

283
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,959
uri

284
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,519
uh that that uh that claim is not

285
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,680
required it's just to help a helpful

286
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,519
hint for parties to know which profile

287
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
is in use

288
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
um and the format of the name document

289
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,000
is text it's not

290
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,880
standardized for machine processing so

291
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
the profile addresses

292
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,199
four major things um serialization

293
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,240
format

294
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,360
um protection

295
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
i like whether the the the uh

296
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,279
eat is signed or encrypted or signed and

297
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,399
encrypted or

298
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,519
not protected um it addresses key

299
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,600
identification

300
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,720
um and it addresses uh what what claims

301
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,519
are required and prohibited

302
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,680
and after yesterday's discussion i'm

303
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,639
actually thinking

304
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,920
um uh freshness and replay protection

305
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,800
need to be added

306
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,839
next

307
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,320
so the serialization uh so it says

308
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,680
whether you could use sibor

309
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,440
or json or both um

310
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,600
and how the nesting can work like if

311
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
you're you know your main format is

312
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,480
seaborg

313
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,920
is it okay to nest a jwt

314
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,279
adjacent token in in the seaboard

315
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,720
vice versa um

316
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,199
for seabor it narrows whether you're

317
00:14:59,199 --> 00:14:59,760
using

318
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,160
a definite and indefinite length

319
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,399
for maps and arrays and strings

320
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,399
and it says how to use seymour tags

321
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,560
uh next slide

322
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,079
i should say the profile says this is a

323
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,760
topic you should address it doesn't

324
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,880
address

325
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,560
address it the discussion or profile in

326
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,959
the document just says these are things

327
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,000
you need to think about when you're

328
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,440
making a profile

329
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,160
so it says

330
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
your profile should should uh say what

331
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
kind of protection you're you're

332
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,120
uh you're requiring whether it is you

333
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
know signing encryption mac

334
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,839
um and then uh

335
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,160
there are the unsecured options uh for

336
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,560
use uh uccs and then unsecured jwds

337
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,759
uh profile should indicate

338
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,600
um yeah so

339
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,000
that sentence is not very good there um

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,120
integrity protection

341
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,639
privacy protection uh you know

342
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,199
do you assign do you encrypt is it

343
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,160
symmetric

344
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,680
encryption or public key based it should

345
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,040
list algorithms probably the right uh

346
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
way to do that is um

347
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,199
the uh list the a list that the test or

348
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,560
the verifier must implement

349
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,120
and a uh and then the uh tester can pick

350
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,000
one of those or

351
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,279
one or more of those um

352
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,639
okay screen share is back um

353
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,639
uh so the profile should be tight enough

354
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,839
that there's an interoperability

355
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,800
guaranteed when

356
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,639
both the tester and verifier implement

357
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,199
the implement

358
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,680
next slide

359
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,040
so key identification

360
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
is you know how does the verifier get

361
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,319
the verification key

362
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,599
and what information is in the

363
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,719
uh a token

364
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,839
perhaps it's through an endorsement

365
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,119
perhaps it's not

366
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,000
um there are a number of ways to

367
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,199
identify a key so

368
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,880
you could do coset key id in an

369
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,480
endorsement

370
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,039
by a claim like the ue id perhaps

371
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,360
something else

372
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,760
uh so the profile should say how that

373
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,160
happens

374
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,240
uh next slide

375
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,520
and then last um since

376
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,640
the claims are optional a profile

377
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,320
probably is going to

378
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,120
require some claims to be present and

379
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
say verification

380
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,679
verification can fail if not profile

381
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:58,320
might

382
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,799
prohibit some claims probably because of

383
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
privacy reasons

384
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,760
a profile can describe new claims

385
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
and add them add them to the

386
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
registry or not um and a

387
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,000
uh profile may allow optional claims

388
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
um and in that case verification

389
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,039
wouldn't fail if they're present

390
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,200
i also should have added here a profile

391
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,160
can narrow

392
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,280
a claim so you know you might say or

393
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,600
refine a claim so for example in the

394
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
location claim

395
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
uh some things like accuracy are

396
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,400
optional

397
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
so a profile could say that they are not

398
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,320
optional

399
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,280
most claims right now are really simple

400
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,000
um i think when we get to the

401
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,400
coast with that's that's a much more

402
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,280
complicated thing so

403
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,200
um i believe that is all i had uh

404
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
let's see go for next slide please

405
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,840
okay so that's all i had for uh profiles

406
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,080
um

407
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,520
um before going to coast wed uh

408
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,760
dave

409
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,039
yeah i just want to say that that's a

410
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,799
great list um

411
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,520
i think that the keep working group was

412
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,000
the first

413
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
you know customer of rats and so the

414
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,400
t protocol spec itself is kind of the

415
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,799
first

416
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,919
candidate profile as i understand it and

417
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,039
so this is a great list of

418
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,039
requirements that the cheap protocol

419
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,320
spec should cover

420
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,880
of which it covers uh some but not all

421
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,760
of these that's why i

422
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,720
thought this was a great list um i guess

423
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,360
there's a

424
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,600
medic question is do you think that a

425
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,799
profile

426
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,880
that would that as you start to have

427
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,039
other other using protocols and things

428
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,240
do you think that a

429
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,679
protocol would typically

430
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
itself specify what profile it is or do

431
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,559
you envision there be

432
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,799
that profiles be something that that

433
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,080
protocols would negotiate

434
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,159
to say which profile is it i'm asking

435
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,840
what you think is the more typical use

436
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,440
case i think in teep we probably just

437
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,240
want to nail

438
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
the teat protocol itself is a profile

439
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,159
there's only one set of things and the t

440
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,159
protocol itself specifies it

441
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,159
but uh do you have any guesses as to

442
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,000
what you think is typical for what

443
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
documents might use profiles and how

444
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,240
many

445
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
uh not i don't i don't have much to say

446
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,960
about that actually

447
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,320
um uh um

448
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,159
i mean it seems like it could be could

449
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,000
could very well be my context

450
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,480
next yeah hey it's gary here sorry i

451
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,039
missed c

452
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,919
it it couldn't do the raise hand uh

453
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,880
raise hand feature

454
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
um so dave i i can say at least

455
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,240
in our internal production we're running

456
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,640
into situations where it has to be

457
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,000
essentially some sort of declarative

458
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
measure it can't be negotiable and so

459
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,840
that's particularly the case where

460
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
indeed is being used in the context of a

461
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,960
device that lacks ip connectivity

462
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
so you can think of maybe um a device

463
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,600
that's listening on the

464
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,640
bluetooth low energy advertising channel

465
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,919
but uh it is requested to send back up

466
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,039
a uh up and at a station through

467
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,159
a hit through a unicast connection so

468
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,960
um in that case we just don't negotiate

469
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
we need to get that out of station up

470
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,600
right away

471
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,760
um it's assumed that they will that the

472
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,120
relying party

473
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
would be able to process whatever

474
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
whatever profile would be declared

475
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,679
inside of the inside of the payload

476
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,520
gotcha yeah that's actually yeah you're

477
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,960
getting to the point of my question

478
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,600
because uh

479
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,520
lawrence you'd mentioned that you know a

480
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,799
claim can specify

481
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,840
in the eat which produ which profile the

482
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,480
eat was generated by right but of course

483
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,559
there's no negotiation mechanism and so

484
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,000
would a protocol ever need something

485
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
another direction that would need to

486
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,880
declare what set of profiles that are

487
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,159
expected

488
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
or when a protocol use mandate nope

489
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,360
here's the protocol

490
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,799
you better be passing an eat that has

491
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,480
the following profile claim

492
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,440
and if you narrow it to only one then is

493
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
the profile claim actually required

494
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,159
claim or kind of profile

495
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,320
say that that claim is absent because

496
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,240
the protocol is only allowed to pass

497
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,919
eats that have a particular profile i

498
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,200
think that's kind of the other half of

499
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,159
the

500
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,480
question

501
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,440
okay um i mean i would imagine

502
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,000
uh all those things are possible

503
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,520
depending on

504
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,679
you know like the fido protocol or the

505
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
whatever gp's using or teep is using or

506
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,480
um so i will take this as a to file an

507
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,960
issue against the tea protocol spec to

508
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,280
uh put in text to make sure we match um

509
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,960
all of the set of requirements for

510
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,080
each profile that's what i'm going to

511
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
take away from this which is why i

512
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,960
thought it was a great list so thanks

513
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,880
yeah um what makes me think maybe we

514
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
should add some text that says

515
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,480
you know uh protocols that carrie eats

516
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
uh you know can choose between

517
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,600
locking down to one profile having a

518
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,080
profile

519
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,159
negotiation if the protocol can support

520
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,400
it i mean i'll probably propose some

521
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,919
text for that and see how it flies

522
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,559
okay uh hank hi laurence

523
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,000
um this is hank um quick question

524
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,080
is the first question basically um how

525
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,200
do you want to express

526
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,679
profiles

527
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,840
uh you mean uh like the format of the

528
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,000
profile document

529
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
yeah if i if i want to create a profile

530
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,159
um you say for example

531
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,360
i said uh you could uh make a

532
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,360
um a map member more narrow

533
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,159
and therefore uh mandate its existence

534
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,760
instead of absolute existence

535
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,840
so so i'm gonna do that now how do i

536
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,159
express that

537
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,000
uh well right now uh any way you want

538
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
i mean you could do it in chinese you

539
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,279
could do it in

540
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,200
uh um you know

541
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,720
a rust program it's completely open

542
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
ended i haven't i haven't really tried

543
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,320
to narrow that at all

544
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,400
okay sorry sorry then i'm specified a

545
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,159
little bit i i'm an uh

546
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,200
itf id author and i want to create

547
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,720
profile text on my id

548
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,880
yeah so right write something down

549
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,320
um yeah i i didn't

550
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,760
i mean i i'm open to some other

551
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,559
suggestions here but i didn't didn't i

552
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,480
didn't want to narrow it at all i mean

553
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
we i mean i suppose we could come up

554
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,799
with some sort of a

555
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,679
convention for doing it but uh i i

556
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,279
didn't have any particular

557
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,799
uh thoughts on how to do that

558
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,640
so i'm bringing up this question because

559
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,080
this reminds me of

560
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,480
that i think that's a subset of your

561
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,000
problem statement

562
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,640
um is that we have this very versatile

563
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,600
cozy

564
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,720
envelope and uh and you uh

565
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,279
if you mandate that is implemented you

566
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,080
have to implement

567
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
that jana algorithm list and that's

568
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
probably not always going to happen

569
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
so what we're doing right now for cozy

570
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,880
is actually to

571
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,520
rewrite the whole cozy spec and

572
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,919
just cherry pick what we want from that

573
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,000
so like there's always of course the the

574
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
central uh envelope there is the tag

575
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
for example messages or keys or

576
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,520
something in cozy

577
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,120
and then the cherry pick the unprotected

578
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,159
and protected stuff

579
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,320
and and put them in to our like and

580
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,480
rewrite the old cdl

581
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,039
and uh and if i look at this like uh

582
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,960
from your point of view now i would say

583
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,080
that's a profile

584
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,200
for cosy use edge you could restrict

585
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,400
uh the number of uh the the the accepted

586
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,360
values for

587
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,320
algorithm ids you could say uh i only

588
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,840
want these two optional and that were

589
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,600
mandatory and nothing else

590
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,840
and such so so i think if you rewrite

591
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,000
that that somehow is already is

592
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,880
a a profile at least for the uh scope of

593
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,400
cozy would you agree or is there

594
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,760
something that i'm missing yeah i

595
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
suppose you could do it that way i i was

596
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,880
not the way i

597
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,919
and i think i've seen that in um the uh

598
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,760
coastwood draft um i thought

599
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
i thought that was a little um i mean

600
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,799
that wasn't my

601
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,400
origin initial thought to do it my

602
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,320
initial thought was just to say

603
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,600
you know he used text to describe um

604
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,880
how you want cos a to be used

605
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,880
um and i mean my thought also is

606
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,080
you know kose should be for a lot of

607
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,039
these things

608
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,000
uh you should allow this variety of

609
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
signing and encryption i mean like cwt

610
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
does

611
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,360
and but okay

612
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,559
um maybe there's some middle grounds

613
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,760
here sorry sorry so

614
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,080
step in here just for a second so i i

615
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,799
think

616
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,480
uh writing something in english text

617
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,000
when you can have a formal language

618
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,880
is not a good idea anymore because then

619
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,159
imposition kicks in

620
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,960
and interoperability lacks and suffers

621
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,480
at some point maybe

622
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,240
and and if you're very precise and what

623
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,640
you expect to be in the message

624
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,480
uh i think there's nothing wrong with

625
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,240
that

626
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,840
yeah okay sure sure

627
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,679
uh thomas you know just just to

628
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
think of what's uh what hank was saying

629
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,720
i think we could

630
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
so your list of requirements is so

631
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,080
precise

632
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,720
that we could come up with uh you know

633
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,360
for example

634
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,520
a a draft template in markdown or in xml

635
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,200
rfc uh with uh with all the sections

636
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,799
pre-populated and you just

637
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,679
fill in the blanks and stuff like that

638
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,600
that might be an option to semi-automate

639
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,720
the thing because

640
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
if you're talking to ctdl hank then you

641
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,039
know constraining a type

642
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,840
is not that

643
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,840
easy i mean it's not like json schema

644
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,919
where you can override the type and

645
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:18,320
apply

646
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,960
more constraint on that and then ctm

647
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,440
doesn't

648
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,840
seem to be prone to that manipulation

649
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,039
at the moment i mean cdl 2.0 will be

650
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,880
another thing as opposed to that no no

651
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,360
um that is that i think the profile is

652
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,399
restating your subset in cdl

653
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,399
is how can you not restrict the type

654
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,159
there

655
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,120
okay if you rewrite completely yes but

656
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,679
uh

657
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,720
well yeah okay well how

658
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,039
if you write it in english text you

659
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,640
would end up with the same

660
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,480
content as you would do in a complete

661
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,679
rewrite right

662
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,520
because everything you touch and you

663
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,039
have to mention

664
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,600
the uh you have to write and and i think

665
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,360
that that in the content of the english

666
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,919
text you would find the exact same thing

667
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,559
uh when would you write it in the cdn

668
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,679
that is true but

669
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,440
that doesn't apply to every single

670
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,120
dimension of the profiling

671
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,840
right it does apply to the constraining

672
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,159
of types and i agree with you but other

673
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,159
um other dimensions are not are not

674
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,440
covered by ctl

675
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,640
so uh there still need to be some

676
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,080
english text somewhere

677
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,960
and that's what i'm trying to say i

678
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,640
suppose that's correct because i'm just

679
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,080
talking about cozy i'm not talking for

680
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,039
example about

681
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,520
how to deal with the freshness overhead

682
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,080
that is not

683
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,919
expressed in it yet for example yeah of

684
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,120
course that is not

685
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,880
there okay okay thanks yeah honest

686
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,039
um i i would like to disagree with hank

687
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,960
here because um having looked at this

688
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,720
from a deep point of view

689
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
as we discussed in the uh earlier

690
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,919
session today

691
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,559
like it's these simple things of saying

692
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,000
something like

693
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,240
we don't use uh encrypt zero

694
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,640
uh but only encrypt and use encrypt i

695
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,960
don't think it needs any cddl to do that

696
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,760
uh i think we are sort of doing overkill

697
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,720
here

698
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,840
um it's just like i had to realize

699
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
uh working on the course you spec and

700
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
and the same applies to what

701
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,600
lauren said to other specs as well is

702
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,880
that some were not

703
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,559
meant to be limited in any in any

704
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,039
shape or form they just specified

705
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,640
everything that came to the

706
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,120
to the mind of the author or the working

707
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
group at that time

708
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,279
and so instead of listing these 20

709
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,559
options you say

710
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,520
like for that profile you just use one

711
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,279
so sorry to kick in here again but but

712
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,360
yes exactly you say that you say your

713
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,440
start message is just one type and you

714
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,799
write cozy

715
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,559
and then you go from there cozy zero for

716
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,080
example and you go from there

717
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,200
uh i think even in cdl it is

718
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,000
like 25 number of characters than in

719
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,360
english text

720
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
because you have to write and in your

721
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,120
message you must and then you can also

722
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,240
write in cdda

723
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,679
start messages equals cozy zero and you

724
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,440
have your rule that's done

725
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,600
so i i i still i understand your

726
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,640
excitement for

727
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,519
for cdl hank but uh i think you're going

728
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,279
overboard here i think what lawrence is

729
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,080
saying that

730
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,000
hey we have too many options we somehow

731
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,039
need to uh sort of produces and

732
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,600
if you write the profile and use cdl to

733
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,120
describe what you want

734
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,159
an implementer to do then that's fine uh

735
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:26,960
maybe for you

736
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,880
and and maybe not for someone else i

737
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,559
don't think we should mandate it has to

738
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,279
be

739
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,399
done in cddl uh like or maybe not

740
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,080
mandating but i think for the

741
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,320
initial exercise we should put it side

742
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,120
by side

743
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,840
and and look at both versions and and

744
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,559
see how the

745
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,840
expressiveness uh is okay or not or what

746
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,720
how does that

747
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,519
like having having now spent uh last

748
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,440
week implementing the cozy stuff

749
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,519
uh like for that for the firmware

750
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,559
encryption

751
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,440
i can tell you that like it's full of

752
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,000
course

753
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
it's full of cddl but it's it's not a

754
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,760
readable very readable document so

755
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,000
um

756
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,760
now that that might be the fact that the

757
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,840
cosi has this extraction script

758
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
uh implied that provides you with the

759
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,399
complete full cdl vba diverge from that

760
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,440
since cosy

761
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,760
i i was not a big fan of that we always

762
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,279
have a redundant

763
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,000
block of the full cdta for implementers

764
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,320
and and then the the fragments broken

765
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,120
out as is

766
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,480
done it's cozy uh reassembling them

767
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,480
is a little bit tricky and annoying i

768
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,679
think personally but

769
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,600
i think jim also had a point that if you

770
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,799
can't expect that

771
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,320
maybe you shouldn't implement that but

772
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,200
that was uh another i think approach

773
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,559
to to to readability okay have you

774
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,159
implemented the course you spec

775
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,039
hank and not the cozy key stuff that you

776
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,360
were

777
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,279
asking about sorry no only the message

778
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,960
stuff yes

779
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,480
um so i mean my takeaway here

780
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,559
is that uh we still need to allow open

781
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,320
description of english some people just

782
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,840
may not want to do it in cd

783
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,880
cdl some people may be very json

784
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,320
oriented or something and

785
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,519
jwt but

786
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,279
there's definitely opportunity to use

787
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,600
cdl to narrow it in certain certain

788
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,559
circumstances

789
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,880
okay um i want to move on to the next

790
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,320
here any last comments

791
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,559
okay uh on to coast woods um and i i

792
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,240
framed the this up as a discussion

793
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,799
because

794
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,519
um i'm i'm kind of

795
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,760
sort of figuring this out stuff myself

796
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,679
so my slides are mostly framing and i

797
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,080
haven't written any text yet or anything

798
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,760
so um my first thought here

799
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,039
is that um

800
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,640
there's actually kind of two forms of of

801
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,159
of um descriptions of software uh that

802
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,320
we're talking about um so there's

803
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,679
descriptions of software that were

804
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,960
created outside the

805
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,079
the the device um

806
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,199
and then there's descriptions of

807
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,520
software that were created on the device

808
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,879
so the the ones created outside the

809
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,520
device

810
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,159
are likely signed by the manufacturer

811
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,800
they're

812
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,199
they are put on the device during

813
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,159
software

814
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,239
installation i think this is sometimes

815
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,960
called a manifest

816
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,760
and i believe these should be relayed to

817
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,520
the verifier i so really

818
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,239
i use the term relay to con to sort of

819
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,679
say that this is

820
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,639
you know the the the attester is not

821
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,960
creating the thing they just

822
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,199
taking what was installed copying it

823
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,320
into a claim and

824
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,679
sitting it to the verifier and

825
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,040
you know it may contain references for

826
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,720
measurements um where as a description

827
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,079
of of uh software created on the device

828
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,520
um is it's run by uh we're made by a

829
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,359
code running on the device

830
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,640
it's going to be signed as part of the

831
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
attestation it might contain

832
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
measurements it's kind of a

833
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,040
an on-the-fly inventory of software on

834
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,320
the device

835
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,520
um uh so

836
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
and and and this is you know my interest

837
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,640
here is

838
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,400
in you know what claims uh go in and eat

839
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,000
so there's there's uses for uh swedes

840
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,680
and coast widths and

841
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,000
lists of software outside of these two

842
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,240
but i'm i'm just focused on

843
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,960
what's going on uh into an eat that's

844
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,800
going from an attester to a verifier

845
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,640
um so uh

846
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,839
and i've started looking at coast woods

847
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,280
and sweds and

848
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,760
and i haven't looked at suit manifests

849
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,400
or

850
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,130
comeds yet but

[Music]

852
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,240
my initial thought right now is that

853
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,760
it should support coast widths

854
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,119
and possibly with some extensions or you

855
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,440
know allowing extensions

856
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,640
um and perhaps some others i mean we

857
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,000
don't have to just pick

858
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,040
one official uh format and

859
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,440
only support it although it would be

860
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,400
nice to pick

861
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,800
one that is widely used so we don't want

862
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,400
having a thousand flowers blooming here

863
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,640
doesn't help interoperability

864
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,839
next slide

865
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,000
uh next slide can you still hear me

866
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,520
okay reconnecting all right um so

867
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,000
uh here's what i'm proposing

868
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,680
oh go back please

869
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,920
there we go thank you um is that eat

870
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,839
must be able to carry coast woods

871
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,280
[Music]

872
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,240
the individual coast woods may or may

873
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,200
not be signed or

874
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,400
may or may not be encrypted so you could

875
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,880
have

876
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,400
unsigned codes with or you could have

877
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,920
signed coast with um

878
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,160
uh

879
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,720
well you know whether you do that

880
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
depends on you know you could say that

881
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,520
in a profile or

882
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,079
or how you know how that system that

883
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,280
particular system in that particular

884
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,040
software base is is working

885
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,320
i'm hoping to avoid xml suites

886
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,480
because that would be another format

887
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,119
that the verifier has to decode

888
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,800
um i would i would hope

889
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,599
that the signing and encryption format

890
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,640
for coast widths

891
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,000
is cose basically done the same way

892
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,280
that it's done for cwt

893
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,400
um and the the cool thing there would be

894
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,040
to be able to reuse the code that that

895
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,760
processes

896
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,119
uh signing in uh and encryption of

897
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,079
of uh cwts for processing signing and

898
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,320
encryption of coswoods

899
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,520
um uh and then

900
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,880
um this

901
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,079
uh whether uh they're a payload uh

902
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,920
coast width or an evidence cost which

903
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,280
which i believe is

904
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,520
uh my understanding is that that that

905
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,880
the two things i distinguished at the

906
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,800
beginning whether it was created

907
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,960
uh by the software creator that's a

908
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
payload uh coswood

909
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,000
if it's created on the device it's an

910
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,520
evidence goes with i might be wrong

911
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,200
about that but

912
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,439
um

913
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
my understanding is there are booleans

914
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,960
inside the coast with that can let

915
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,079
tell you which one that is

916
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,880
so then i've got um three options for

917
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,760
how to

918
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,599
put coast woods into eat

919
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,119
we know we have to carry more than one

920
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,160
coast wood

921
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,640
because there's two different types and

922
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,560
if you're putting coast woods

923
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,240
on that represent installed software

924
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,920
there could be many software packages

925
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,880
installed so

926
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,040
you can't just have one coast wood to

927
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,200
describe it all because those were

928
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
created independently and signed

929
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,920
independently so you have to carry it

930
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,720
you have to relay all of them

931
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,920
so one option is a single claim

932
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,560
called coast woods and it's an array

933
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,240
and then you look inside the coast wood

934
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,000
to figure out what what they are you

935
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,520
just put the pile them all into one

936
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,839
array

937
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,839
a second option is to just say

938
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,880
you can put coast woods into eat and

939
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,240
then

940
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,839
not create any claims at all

941
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,119
in the eat spec and

942
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,200
leave it up to profiles and other other

943
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,560
folks to define

944
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,839
um claims uh

945
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,760
that the kerry uh coast would so this is

946
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,000
similar to the how the public key text

947
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,960
ended up in eat

948
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,160
um a third option would be to have a

949
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,040
single claim

950
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,480
for the evidence coswood

951
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,640
and a single claim for the payload co

952
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,880
sweat

953
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,160
and then handle multiple coast widths

954
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,280
via eat sub modules so if you had three

955
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,800
installed packages

956
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,040
that you wanted to add relay the coast

957
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,000
woods for

958
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,119
you create three eat sub mods

959
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,920
um one for each of the the the

960
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,319
applications there

961
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,279
um uh

962
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,839
can we go to the next slide

963
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,400
okay yeah so you know go back uh back

964
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,040
please um

965
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,000
i've also been having a side discussion

966
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,920
about coast with um you know there's

967
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,240
some

968
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
they're they're somewhat file system

969
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,280
oriented um

970
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,319
and um seems like you could uh

971
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,560
that doesn't work for all all devices it

972
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,400
seems like you could work around that by

973
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,520
uh extensions another thing i

974
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,190
thought that you know in the phone world

975
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,560
[Music]

976
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,079
a lot of the software is in form of

977
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,119
applications so coswood doesn't have

978
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,640
anything that describes an application

979
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,680
um you know that that is specifically

980
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,079
isolated and separate from other

981
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,440
applications and has

982
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,680
its own kind of identity and i think

983
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,680
[Music]

984
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,040
tees also have a strong notion of

985
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,000
applications

986
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,280
for uh installed trusted apps um okay so

987
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,599
that's

988
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,440
that's about all i had to say um dave

989
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,200
yeah just making sure you can hear me um

990
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,960
my question is there's you have three

991
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,160
options on the slide

992
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,640
are you saying that um all three options

993
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,400
are supported or is there a question to

994
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,280
the working group

995
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,599
about which option should be allowed or

996
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,520
i couldn't understand

997
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,640
what the three options were who is the

998
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,400
chooser of the option

999
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
ah yes uh it's a question to the working

1000
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,440
group

1001
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,319
ah okay in that case um to the extent

1002
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:43,760
that i understand is there may be things

1003
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,680
that i didn't quite follow but

1004
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,160
i think option number three is probably

1005
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,359
the cleanest

1006
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,280
option number two is the next cleanest

1007
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,200
and i don't like option one

1008
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,440
okay cool

1009
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,359
hank hi um

1010
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,880
mrs hank i can see why you want to have

1011
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,599
two

1012
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,400
different claims for evidence and

1013
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,000
payload tags

1014
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,480
as long as they are tagged on the

1015
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,560
seaboard encoding the same way i mean

1016
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,000
the cosmetics

1017
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,359
um i guess that's fine but my

1018
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,160
question is why can't you do the array

1019
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,240
thing from option one with these two

1020
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,599
claims in option three

1021
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,000
why do you have to wear to do the sub

1022
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
modules

1023
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,319
that's a little bit confusing to me uh i

1024
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:36,720
i'm i'm uh pretty open to all this i

1025
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,440
don't

1026
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,240
i mean i if there's an option for four

1027
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,200
five six seven eight

1028
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,359
sure let's go for it discussion

1029
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,520
hank let me elaborate on why i said the

1030
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,400
preference

1031
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,359
and that's um i hypothesize it will be

1032
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,200
common in protocols

1033
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,640
that you'll want to have some

1034
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,240
information about

1035
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,079
some additional information about each

1036
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,000
cause word that's not beyond that which

1037
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,079
is embedded in the coswood itself

1038
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,280
okay and so and option number one

1039
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,640
you can't do that without having

1040
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,480
something like a parallel array

1041
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,640
or duplicating the causewood into some

1042
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,920
other structure too so that's why i

1043
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,680
don't like option one is if you need to

1044
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,440
pass anything that's on a per coswood

1045
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,240
basis

1046
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,760
you can't do it in option number one

1047
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,280
without doing option number two or three

1048
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,400
so that's why i said i didn't like

1049
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,920
number one okay

1050
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,920
if you only have the list of causewoods

1051
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,359
then it's all the same right it doesn't

1052
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,640
matter which option you choose option

1053
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,560
one is fine but i hypothesize

1054
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,240
that it is common to have additional

1055
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
information you want to pass about

1056
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,800
each coswood and in that case i believe

1057
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,000
you have to go to option two

1058
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,960
or three anyway and between those i'd

1059
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,599
say

1060
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,960
if this is the part that i'm not sure i

1061
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,560
completely understood the difference

1062
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,000
between two and three correctly but i

1063
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,119
think i did

1064
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,520
and option number three you're doing the

1065
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,359
metadata about each coswood

1066
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,920
one per sub module and so it's like you

1067
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,480
know nesting each structures and things

1068
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,240
where each coswood could have an

1069
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,839
arbitrary set of claims with it that's

1070
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,359
what i think is the cleanest way to do

1071
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,480
it i think that matches well

1072
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,560
things like layered attestation where

1073
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,760
you have a wood per

1074
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,680
layer for example and you have a set of

1075
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,119
claims about each layer and you can

1076
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,400
reuse the same

1077
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,880
claim ids um about you know

1078
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,040
like i don't know time stamp or time

1079
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,160
sense boot or

1080
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,480
time sense that that software has been

1081
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,000
running things like that you could reuse

1082
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,440
the same thing in each sub module i

1083
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,400
think that would be fine that's why i

1084
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,319
think three is the cleanest

1085
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,839
if i understand it right just because

1086
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,319
you can embed arbitrary metadata along

1087
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:29,839
with each coswood in

1088
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,960
option number three i think if i

1089
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
understand right you could do that in

1090
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,960
two

1091
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,319
as well but the letting

1092
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,520
profiles define specific claims came

1093
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,880
across to me as harder

1094
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,760
to than reusing standard claims along

1095
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,079
with

1096
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,680
each one and bundling it somehow which

1097
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,200
is how i interpreted option three

1098
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,520
so that's why i said my preference is to

1099
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,319
say

1100
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,160
you can have multiple of them and with

1101
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,920
each coswood you can have another set of

1102
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,599
eight claims including standard ones

1103
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,200
your private ones or whatever else and

1104
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,200
my understanding is sub modules let you

1105
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,640
do that already and so that's the long

1106
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,240
reason for my preference for three

1107
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,319
hopefully i got my assumptions right and

1108
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,599
but if not then you can at least

1109
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,599
understand what my uh preference is and

1110
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,800
map them to something else if that's

1111
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,400
option four or something so

1112
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,560
yeah so i'm basically looking for input

1113
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,520
to go write some text on so

1114
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,200
and then then we'll discuss the text

1115
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,079
okay so i think that sorry may i

1116
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,520
interject

1117
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
lawrence or so yeah just just one more

1118
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,560
comment i don't think

1119
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,560
um putting the text in for option three

1120
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,480
precludes people from doing option two

1121
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,160
so go ahead

1122
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,160
yeah today's elaboration on on

1123
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,160
bundling a switch goes with with sorry

1124
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,040
it costs with with additional data on a

1125
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,800
pair codes with basis i think makes

1126
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,119
sense

1127
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,960
option 3 also disables you or

1128
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,440
disables you from prohibits you from

1129
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,480
from using just

1130
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,720
a single claim you have to know what

1131
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,960
you're doing i think that's fair to say

1132
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,760
and fair to

1133
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,960
want but now you

1134
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,000
can't mess that up you can't pay

1135
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,119
place a payload code that's perfectly

1136
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,640
fine in a evidence label

1137
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,680
um i guess that's okay um

1138
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,160
but that is an another threshold where

1139
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,720
you have to

1140
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,680
uh can make mistakes um so that's my

1141
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,079
only

1142
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,160
uh uh small issue with three i'm still

1143
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,680
okay with the uh

1144
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,520
with the evidence payload claim because

1145
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,119
i think it's fine because payload

1146
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,079
apparently is

1147
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,599
more on the rim stuff that we are

1148
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,599
building with here with with thomas and

1149
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,160
co

1150
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,240
and and evidence is more on the the eat

1151
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
stuff and it makes a lot of sense to

1152
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,119
to say yeah this is not evidence when uh

1153
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,640
you put it into a heat

1154
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,520
that is i think really important so uh

1155
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,160
yeah

1156
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,319
i guess three is fine for now and we can

1157
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,079
see how this works

1158
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,240
okay ned yeah so uh kosovo has a

1159
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,480
you know a signature is attached to it

1160
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,319
it has a signature attached to it we

1161
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,200
have a draft

1162
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,400
that describes how to do an unsigned eat

1163
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,599
um is this as option

1164
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,280
are any of these options are all these

1165
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,440
options this asserting or assuming that

1166
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,920
the

1167
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,240
signature component of coast wood goes

1168
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,760
away

1169
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,000
or are we saying that they're nested

1170
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,839
signatures

1171
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,720
yeah um either way so in all of these

1172
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
options the coast would could be signed

1173
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,960
or unsigned

1174
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,800
i mean the evidence one is a little

1175
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,480
weird to sign

1176
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,430
uh separately um

1177
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:41,680
[Music]

1178
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,200
i don't know what who would be signing

1179
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,800
that um and

1180
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,240
the payload one is presumably signed so

1181
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,079
most cases i would assume evidence ones

1182
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,760
are unsigned and payload ones are signed

1183
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,200
but i wasn't thinking to require it

1184
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,680
either way

1185
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,079
yeah quick bonus question and and same

1186
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,440
with sibo attacks so

1187
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,240
uh sibo attacks outside of the envelope

1188
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,280
are an end or

1189
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,680
inside of the envelope for coast is that

1190
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,599
fine for you also

1191
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,880
because that's how we designed it at the

1192
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
moment

1193
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,200
yeah i don't know i i i don't know i

1194
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,079
have to

1195
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,280
i haven't thought about it yet okay

1196
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,079
no problem thanks

1197
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,640
um so uh

1198
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,839
there's uh seems like there's general

1199
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,280
consensus that uh using coast woods

1200
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,440
is a good thing that we should proceed

1201
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,839
with ghost waves we

1202
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:47,520
like um you know comeds or

1203
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,680
cobrams or i'm not sure what all they

1204
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,599
they are at this point um

1205
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,400
uh are not going to replace coast weds

1206
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,720
in the long run um is is that is that

1207
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,040
right

1208
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,119
uh yeah this is saying speaking to that

1209
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,880
yeah that is correct uh they are not

1210
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,240
altering them

1211
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,359
uh the the the co-rim part

1212
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,319
extends a single item into a coast wood

1213
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:16,079
but leaves it a coast bed

1214
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,480
so so of course we can better reference

1215
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,240
commits that they can't do this natively

1216
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:20,720
we would

1217
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,040
have a clunky structure we want to do it

1218
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,319
with the neat

1219
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,079
orderly structure so there's a tiny

1220
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,000
extension to close with this

1221
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,319
rim stuff but that's it it's the same as

1222
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,760
before

1223
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:41,440
and anybody want xml suites

1224
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,640
i guess that's a no okay good

1225
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,879
um

1226
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,800
uh so i think the next step is for me to

1227
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,319
take what i heard here and

1228
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,079
and uh work on some text

1229
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,040
um so i'll go do that thomas

1230
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,040
[Music]

1231
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,480
hi laurence sorry uh thomas here um so

1232
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,040
your suggestion would be for a situation

1233
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,359
where you don't have a file system

1234
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,160
uh where to anchor your core suites to

1235
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,040
to define

1236
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,558
a cost with extension uh to handle that

1237
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:22,800
or um

1238
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,079
i i think that's one possibility um uh

1239
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,640
if that's uh you know unworkable or

1240
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,559
somebody comes up with you know some

1241
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,720
brilliant alternative to ghostwoods for

1242
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,119
that um

1243
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,079
that could also be uh an option i don't

1244
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:40,480
think

1245
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:41,920
just because we picked coast woods we're

1246
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,640
picking the um

1247
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,680
the one and only format for for carrying

1248
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,440
you know software descriptions and

1249
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,359
measurements

1250
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,079
okay because for our use case the pc1 as

1251
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,520
you know uh

1252
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,280
going for crossfit is a bit overkill

1253
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,559
because

1254
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,480
the overhead of the encoding and the

1255
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,079
fact that we need to please the cosmic

1256
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,319
format in many respects that are not

1257
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,680
essential to us

1258
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,960
you know creates this multiple bytes of

1259
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,079
uh rubbish basically that we

1260
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,720
just need to put there in order to to

1261
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,520
please the

1262
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,520
the format um so yeah for the time being

1263
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,480
we have

1264
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,160
defined our own software measurement

1265
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,000
claim right um

1266
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,400
we wanted to have something that is you

1267
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,760
know on the standard

1268
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,640
uh side but going coursework at this

1269
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,079
point in time doesn't look like

1270
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,559
a an excellent choice from our point of

1271
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,359
view so

1272
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,680
we will need to you know figure out

1273
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,640
something

1274
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:43,119
here yeah um i mean i i

1275
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,960
we don't have time for that discussion

1276
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,240
now but um

1277
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,200
i think it would be really good to see

1278
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,680
if

1279
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,079
we could tweak coast woods to make them

1280
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:52,720
fit your

1281
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,760
your uses better so we have i don't know

1282
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,559
maybe we can

1283
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,079
some fields that are mandatory now can

1284
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,240
be made optional or something like that

1285
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:00,960
too

1286
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,040
to do better i mean i think that would

1287
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,240
be cool but

1288
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,079
we've done that exercise if you want we

1289
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,760
can take it offline and

1290
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,160
okay check the numbers okay

1291
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:14,880
cool

1292
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,280
okay uh thank you for all that

1293
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,960
discussion and any other

1294
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,040
quick comments on on uh cuz

1295
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,720
um okay uh then the last topic uh

1296
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,040
geary next slide

1297
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,920
yeah thanks lawrence uh um sorry to

1298
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,200
insert this in here but

1299
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,400
uh uh just as a disclaimer i'm the

1300
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,680
co-chair of the

1301
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,960
fido alliance iot working group and we

1302
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,680
we're developing a well we're pretty far

1303
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,240
along

1304
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,359
in developing a device onboarding spec

1305
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,480
it's available on our website and uh

1306
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,880
and we do have a normative dependency on

1307
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,000
feet

1308
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,319
one of the things that's been discovered

1309
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,359
is that

1310
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,680
the way we are using juice is we're

1311
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,720
taking

1312
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,839
our ueid is we're using a we're calling

1313
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,760
it something called the guide in the

1314
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,720
spec

1315
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,839
global you you globally universal id

1316
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,880
um and our reading was that that maps

1317
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,680
directly to

1318
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,880
the ueid so we said that for

1319
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,400
any payload we can go ahead and

1320
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,720
transmit what we uh what the spec calls

1321
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,559
as a guide in the ueid field

1322
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,240
now one of the things though with

1323
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,800
guide and i'll apologize for using good

1324
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,480
and ueid interchangeably because i'm

1325
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,160
going to get to a reason why it may not

1326
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,680
they may not be uh used interchangeably

1327
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,280
is that in the fido spec a manufacturer

1328
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,640
guide

1329
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,880
which is uh which is potentially

1330
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,640
provisioned at the factory

1331
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,200
can be replaced by the device owner

1332
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,040
after onboarding

1333
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,680
and if that's that occurs in the

1334
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,599
manufacture good can only be restored

1335
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:00,160
through

1336
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,920
something like a factory reset operation

1337
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,760
the current text states that the ueid

1338
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,319
quote should be permanent um

1339
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,799
so i've given so i've given some

1340
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:15,760
guidance

1341
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,359
to the fido working group that

1342
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,200
we can live with that language because

1343
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,880
it's a should requirement

1344
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,079
uh and and just move on but

1345
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,960
the issue is you know the issue is what

1346
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,200
it

1347
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,160
you know is does um does the rats

1348
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,200
working group

1349
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,359
feel similarly on this and uh it would

1350
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,720
be something that i think

1351
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,680
we need to get resolved before last week

1352
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,400
we may want to resolve before last call

1353
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,200
the issue has been posted um the fido

1354
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,040
iot working group has proposed

1355
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,319
text where we where we

1356
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,440
um where we just we're summarizing we

1357
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,839
describe where ueid

1358
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,960
could uh it could be replaced during a

1359
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,960
device life cycle um

1360
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,119
so this is kind of so this is kind of a

1361
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,680
pesky issue i think what lawrence

1362
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,000
lawrence uh may have some words on this

1363
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,760
on privacy preservation and

1364
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,319
ueid as well so i'll kind of give the

1365
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:14,960
floor back

1366
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,280
over to lawrence yeah we're taking

1367
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,240
questions

1368
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,640
lawrence did you want to comment on this

1369
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,839
um yeah

1370
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,319
uh so i mean my my intention

1371
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:31,440
was you know that uids

1372
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,359
should be permanent that they maybe i

1373
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,680
should even say must be permanent

1374
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,680
um that this shouldn't be

1375
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,440
uh changing the uid shouldn't be allowed

1376
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,920
and then in the discussion on the on the

1377
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,760
github issue i proposed

1378
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,960
an s-u-ue id which is a semi-permanent

1379
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,720
ueid which can be

1380
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,040
uh changed on change of ownership and

1381
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,160
and factory reset and stuff like that

1382
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,400
um i also think there's other

1383
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,480
possibilities for addressing

1384
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,280
privacy preservation for ueids like i i

1385
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,799
did an implementation where

1386
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,520
the the requester of the token was

1387
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,160
authenticated

1388
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,599
and ueids were per authenticated

1389
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,720
requester so i think there's some

1390
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,160
variety of solutions here so my my uh

1391
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,720
thought is to try to find you know maybe

1392
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:27,200
define a couple of these solutions

1393
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,760
um but i think this is still uh open

1394
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,040
discussion right now and i think we

1395
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,079
should have the discussion

1396
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,440
um uh guy

1397
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,359
hi lawrence skye um i i

1398
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,440
i i know there's a lot of complexity

1399
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,119
when it comes to identification of

1400
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,079
devices but

1401
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,599
i i assume you have followed the ieee

1402
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,799
802.1 ar

1403
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,640
spec which explicitly separates the

1404
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,480
manufacturer id from

1405
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,839
an id that might be supplied by a device

1406
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,280
owner

1407
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,000
and if if there's anything there that's

1408
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,799
applicable

1409
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,839
that might help to you know minimize the

1410
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:08,640
number of different

1411
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:13,440
variations that we we end up with

1412
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,480
yeah i haven't looked at that but i i

1413
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,400
will

1414
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,240
okay let me know if i can provide a

1415
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,599
reference or something

1416
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,599
yeah if you if you would uh just email

1417
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:26,880
me the reference that'd be great thank

1418
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,040
you

1419
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:36,480
sure

1420
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,960
so uh just the time check we're you know

1421
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,720
just a couple minutes before

1422
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,200
we run out of nerdy have other slides or

1423
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,280
other topics no this is this is this is

1424
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,960
the last topic

1425
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,359
yeah um so at least on this issue 98

1426
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:52,960
what should i take uh i'll ask cheers

1427
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,400
what should i take back to find out can

1428
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,359
we live with this

1429
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,920
this as fast as back as it stands or

1430
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,440
does the uh or

1431
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,240
or do we or do we need to go offline and

1432
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,920
we visit

1433
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,119
and address this before last call

1434
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,640
well i mean i think we have a little a

1435
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,160
little time before last call i don't

1436
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,160
anticipate it happening that that soon

1437
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,359
so um uh wow okay it's

1438
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,040
holding up the fido spec progress that's

1439
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,240
what i mean i should have probably

1440
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,440
mentioned that so

1441
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,079
um you know i i think if we're saying

1442
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,440
that we don't

1443
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,119
if the group wants us to go and revisit

1444
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,280
this and i'll say that the fido stack

1445
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,640
has to uh

1446
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,119
you know you know the use of the photo

1447
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:32,400
spec for ueid

1448
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,799
may it may have to be revisited though

1449
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:35,680
because the rat's

1450
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,839
document may evolve the eight

1451
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:39,200
documentary involved

1452
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,720
yeah yeah i see so you're actually

1453
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,400
talking about the last call of the fido

1454
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,079
document not the last call of the

1455
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,760
document well it's essentially both yeah

1456
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:51,040
but yeah yeah i mean i've been through

1457
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:51,760
this before

1458
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,240
where we've in other standard bodies

1459
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,520
where we referred to

1460
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,359
an id and the uh it made it normative

1461
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,559
and then the uh

1462
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,079
and then the rfc ended up with

1463
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,760
substantial changes so i think

1464
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,200
at least for friday we'd like to avoid

1465
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,520
that so um

1466
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,960
because then we would have to reopen the

1467
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,559
spec and change it

1468
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,960
okay it could be that yeah yeah we'll

1469
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,799
try to address this sooner rather than

1470
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,240
later then okay

1471
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,200
okay okay guys we're we're out of time

1472
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,079
so

1473
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,119
my suggestion would be to um

1474
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,520
to take this issue on the mail list

1475
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,799
lawrence

1476
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,200
right because minimally at least there

1477
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,359
needs to be clarification on how

1478
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,680
and the intent of the ids that we're

1479
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,839
specifying in the e-draft

1480
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,280
um but given that we're out of time it'd

1481
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,760
be good to just continue the discussion

1482
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,400
on the main list yeah yeah or or in in

1483
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,799
github

1484
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,160
well not everybody looks at the github

1485
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,640
so it'd be good to do it both

1486
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,640
yes and milestones we did not cover

1487
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,280
those

1488
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,839
uh it i'd love to get an estimate from

1489
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,079
you and i'll bring it to the list

1490
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,079
lawrence in terms of where you think eid

1491
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,440
is at i don't think you're going to make

1492
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,200
the milestone and tuda and some of the

1493
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,480
other drafts

1494
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,240
won't make your milestones either some

1495
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,079
of the other ones that are earlier on

1496
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,040
the milestones i think look fine

1497
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,040
so we'll do that on list thank you

1498
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,599
okay so i think with that we're ready to

1499
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:24,480
close

1500
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,720
um

1501
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,960
yeah i was just looking at the chat i

1502
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,480
think we're done um

1503
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,559
so let's take continue the discussions

1504
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,760
on the mail list

1505
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,319
and with that have a good rest of the

1506
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,000
week

1507
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,799
thanks everyone

1508
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:53,839
thanks nancy

1509
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,240
you
