much appreciated and also i asked my

58
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,480
colleague hamian to help us

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
also for the blue sheets actually uh

60
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,599
there's nothing for us to do

61
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,200
it we are you know created automatically

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,839
next

63
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,400
so for ipr ipr policy is quite very

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
important

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
you know and because it's really about

66
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,720
you know

67
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,799
money behind it's it's more like

68
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,480
commercial stuff so

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,799
we all should you know follow the idf

70
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,599
policies

71
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
very well and so uh if you are one of

72
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,360
the authors or contributors

73
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,760
i think you have to you know respond to

74
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
ipr polling as soon as possible

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,560
otherwise

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
it will delay your draft progress

77
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,920
next

78
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
so for the main list we you know we

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,959
always you know intelligent

80
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,680
seeking people who use the main list as

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,799
much as possible

82
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,920

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
example we can you know

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560

85
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,840

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040

since you you you've been at the c-camp

130
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,400
chair for for many years we think

131
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,840
we still want to

132
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,919
let me say feel like one of your

133
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,080
favorite working groups

134
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,280
don't say is not the case

135
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
okay so let's proceed them

136
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,479
um recent rfcs there is nana

137
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,960
but we have two of them in the editor

138
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,240
queue

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,000
uh the layer zero type and the w sonyang

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
the young model for the topology both of

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
the drafts have been parked

142
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
while waiting uh on uh

143
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,639
in alignment on on the young prefix

144
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
prefixes

145
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
uh this is something that uh we decided

146
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,160
as a

147
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
as a working group uh i would say

148
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,520
a few weeks ago so the idea uh the idea

149
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,400
is a day

150
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
to come to

151
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,740
a conclusion uh on

152
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,280
[Music]

153
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,560
how how to proceed we

154
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
we left some room for that discussion as

155
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,240
well

156
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,039
we we already had uh quite many

157
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,319
uh let me say votes preferences

158
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,120
expressed

159
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
on the mailing list so it's now time to

160
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,039
draw the conclusion

161
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,400
and have the two drafts being progressed

162
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
uh we have the w zone tunnel model is

163
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,039
is expired but i think it's just a

164
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
matter of

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,599
timing at the time because uh

166
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
i mean the entire working group

167
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,280
expressed the interest

168
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,199
in the draft so i don't take the fact

169
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,639
that it expired as a

170
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
as a lack of interest from the working

171
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,960
group to proceed

172
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,080
we have a new working group draft and we

173
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,120
er we the authors uh

174
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
showed that is is absolutely possible to

175
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,080
change the name

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,479
and the title of the draft from

177
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
from uh individual contribution to

178
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
working group document

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
and you see the the change has been

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
successfully recorded

181
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,800
in the data tracker and

182
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,680
the the the name of the new draft that

183
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,399
we adopt

184
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,720
is ethernet cliente topology

185
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,720
we have quite many working group drafts

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,839
discussed

187
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,360
in in the agenda

188
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
we have also put together a slide

189
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,880
to make a recap on where we are with the

190
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,920

198
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
a new foreseeable deadline

for for the review to be available

200
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,600
other

201
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,600
drafts discussed today span from

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
flexibility media channel to layer one

203
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,240
types and the service model and updates

204
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,600
on the otn

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
topology and the tunnel models so a lot

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,279
of modeling today

207
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,279
um

208
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,720
there are also a number

209
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,760
of uh working through group drafts

210
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,440
not in the agenda we received

211
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
some updates on them for example the otn

212
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,279
beyond 100 gigabit applicability is

213
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,800
pretty stable

214
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,760
and ready to move forward

215
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
we decided now to offload a little bit

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
of the young doctors and the next two

217

we will uh submit to the sg

219
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,680
or after after working group las cola

220
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,959
will be the mbi applicability statement

221
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,000
uh whose for which

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,360
the ipr polling is is concluded

223
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
so ready to

224

and the otn beyond the one of the

229
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
gigabit applicability

230
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,000
[Music]

244
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,639
young models for the last one

245
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,000
the w impairment validation info

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,120
actually has expired today so i will

247
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,959
resume it

248
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,000
keeping in mind that the evolution of

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,800
the other

250
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
new draft we have

251
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,479
thanks a lot

252
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,240
thanks to you gabriella

253
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
uh we have another one of the client

254
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,200
signal

255
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,360
younger which was updated in january

256
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,440
to add the state information in the

257
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,519
modules

258
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
there is some more work needed before

259
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,920
uh considering this adam

260
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,120
especially especially on

261
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,240
underlying technology entries and and

262
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,959
then

263
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,880
the authors believe that this one

264
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,240
could be considered in a pretty good

265
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,040
shape

266
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,000
to be to be sent to to the next stage

267
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,839
so this is a recap of the young daughter

268
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,720
reviews

269
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,680
that we we asked that have been

270
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,880
performed

271
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,199
in the last year also a couple of years

272
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,440
so you see you see that some of them

273
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,480
have been reviewed

274
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,040
in earlier stages so uh

275
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,000
around the network the working group

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,560
adoption

277
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,519
phase some others uh close to the last

278
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,639
call

279
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,399
the ws topology has been has been

280
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,199
reviewed

281
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,399
a lot of comments uh it's uh

282
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,079
everything has been fixed and it's in

283
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,519
the editor queue

284
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,279
as i said before the flexibly the

285
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,560
younger is the one

286
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,639
uh for which we asked the

287
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
review at the beginning of the year the

288
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
deadline expired

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,040
it was supposed to be ready on the 22nd

290
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,000
of february

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,639
so i mean hopefully we should have a

292
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,519
review

293
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,160
pretty soon

294
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
uh have been reviewed recently in uh

295
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,800
there it was revision uh the the version

296
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
that was reviewed was 11

297
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,880
now we are in 12 and it was at the end

298
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,519
of last year so

299
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
we i don't think another round of review

300
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,399
is needed

301
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,120
before the working group last call

302
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,959
different stories for the l1

303
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,160
csm and the layer one types which

304
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,719
have been reviewed quite some time ago

305
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
no review has been requested for the

306
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,720
wson tunnel but

307
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
i mean as soon as we will get we don't

308
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,480
think

309
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,240
that there is the need for

310
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,160
a an interim review of the draft

311
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
uh probably a classical young daughter

312
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
review

313
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,839
when approaching last call would be

314
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
would be enough

315
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
liaisons and communications we we

316
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
received the

317
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,360
liaison from itut study group 15

318
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
it was in october 2020

319
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
it was the periodical

320
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,600
update on

321
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
optical transport network

322
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,360
standardization work

323
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,519
this is something that was not just a

324
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,440
center to see camper but the two c

325
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
camp mpls pulse pc and tsa so

326
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,560
um a coordination among the different

327
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,519
working groups

328
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
will will be done as usual and the joint

329
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,360
reply

330
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
will be will be sent to a tut

331
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,160
so this this is it for the

332
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,240
administrative part that we

333
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,079
as what i anticipated that we allocated

334
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
some time to the discussion to

335
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,680
get the discussion of some topics that

336
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,560
we wanted

337
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,040
to uh let me see that that for sure i

338
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
will need

339
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
to be discussed and reviewed on the

340
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,079
milling list but

341
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,800
uh taking the opportunity of

342
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,440
a live meeting could be could be

343
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,199
discussed today

344
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,639
milestones are the first

345
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,360
we have not been updating them for a

346
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,079
while

347
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,239
so most of the milestones that we had

348
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,599
in uh where were pretty old and most of

349
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,240
them

350
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,599
completed a charter we were

351
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,599
let me say over the years so we didn't

352
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,039
get too far from our charter

353
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,439
so it can be considered still still

354
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,640
valid and applicable

355
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
but an update

356
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,039
could be could be needed

357
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,720
and we would like also as anticipated

358
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,360
before

359
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,919
close the discussion on on the young

360
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,039
prefixes

361
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,240
and uh make

362
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,600
make a decision on on how to proceed

363
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,039
so this is the list of the milestones

364
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,320
actually on on our web page you see

365
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,600
they are pretty pretty old uh

366
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,200
most of them have been have been

367
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,760
successfully completed some of them have

368
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,720
been removed

369
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,039
because uh drafts expired the working

370
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:05,360
group

371
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,039
didn't show a big interest

372
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,200
in in them but and this is the list

373
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,640
of a new milestone

374
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,720
that we are proposing this is a split

375
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,240
into two

376
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,720
sections

377
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,080
submit items that we wanted to submit

378
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,400
to the sg and uh new

379
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
working group adoptions

380
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,679
so new items that the working group

381
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,720
will be working will be working on

382
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,400
so one thing that

383
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,520
i would like to discuss with with

384
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,960
the working group now is uh

385
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,000
priorities so this is the

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,080
list of uh drafts

387
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,760
that we would like to submit to the isd

388
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,080
in a prioritized order um

389
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,799
i would like to have the working group

390
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,080
saying uh

391
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,320
if there is agreement with disorder of

392
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,520
if someone believes

393
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,400
that some topics should be prioritized

394
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,480
over others

395
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,440
and for what reasons

396
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,679
uh

397
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,400
let me go through them quickly the first

398
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,280
one

399
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,120
is uh i mean this is a

400
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,960
sort of borderline because it's

401
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,440
something that

402
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
we already achieved which is having

403
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,320
the ethernet topology

404
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,840
young model becoming a working group

405
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
document

406
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
then as i said before the next draft

407
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
that we would like to progress

408
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,240
is the transport mbi

409
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,039
applicability

410
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
this is a typo i apologize for that as

411
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,799
uh it might it must be there

412
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,400
from wrong copy based then we expect

413
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,679
to to work

414
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,600
to deliver the first layer on player 1

415
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,280
drafts so the

416
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,200
the types which are

417
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,320
let me say already in a pretty

418
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,000
good advanced the stage the topology

419
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,720
the ot topology and then the flexigrid

420
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,559
the topology to complete

421
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,720
the topology set of documents uh

422
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
topology young models for layer zero

423
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
layer one

424
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
then the layer one csm

425
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,520
the applicability actually this is

426
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,200
something that in my opinion could be

427
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
anticipated a bit

428
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
because this is something that has no

429
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,080
doesn't

430
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,360
need any uh

431
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,720
young review young check so this is

432
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
probably something that we can speed up

433
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,520
and then work on the wson

434
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
id info model and then start uh once the

435
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,360
topology documents are ready to start

436
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,919
working

437
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,840
on the tunnel models w tunnel ws on

438
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,120
otn the flexi grid the media channel

439
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,639
client signal the wdm interfaces etc

440
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
is there anything that you would like to

441
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,520
change

442
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
anything that in your opinion needs to

443
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,559
be prioritized over other

444
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
topics

445
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,600
yes yes

446
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
okay if there's no other comment we can

447
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,400
go to the

448
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,600
uh working group adoption once this is a

449
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,320
sort of

450
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,200
summary the topics which are individual

451
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,400
contributions at at the moment this one

452
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,440
is highlighted

453
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,200
in in yellow because uh it seems

454
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,760
that i don't remember if it's expired

455
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,159
and

456
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,600
from since when

457
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,960
but the the the feeling

458
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,360
at least advertising mine is that there

459
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,640
is no big interest in progressing a work

460
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,960
on lmp extensions for flex grid

461
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,440
if you believe that this is not the case

462
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,640
please

463
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,280
please let us know uh or

464
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
now or on the mailing list so that we

465
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
can consider it

466
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,240
when doing uh reprioritization

467
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,200
of the work

468
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
regarding the others uh ethernet

469
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,120
tunnel

470
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,600
client signal performance monitoring

471
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,440
client topology

472
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,400
a client tunnel and otn network slicing

473
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,279
these are not

474
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,159
in a priority order so this is something

475
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,120
that the needs

476
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,400
needs to be prioritized so if you would

477
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,600
like to express

478
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,720
your preferences for a prioritization

479
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,919
once again now during the meeting

480
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,039
or on the mailing list

481
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,279
some of them duplicate off each other

482
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,760
i i can't hear you very well now i don't

483
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,400
know if

484
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,000
just my problem or

485
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
can you try to to say it again

486
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,360
oh hello is it better yes

487
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
okay sense so i'm saying there is some

488
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,200
duplication

489
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
with the given body for example the

490
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,320
ethernet

491
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,158
should be the line panel

492
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
okay and the client topology

493
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,799
is the one just adopted as a ethernet

494
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,600
topology apology

495
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,760
okay very good

496
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
okay one is duplicated one is already

497
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,559
there okay

498
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,120
that's fine please john

499
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,640
um open microwave

500
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,760
what can you uh yeah so i i'm

501
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,960
i'm asking if you're using an open mic

502
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,720
it might be good if you mute when

503
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,559
somebody else is speaking because every

504
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,200
time

505
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,840
someone else while your mic is open

506
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,720
there's

507
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
a pretty serious echo that everyone else

508
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
can hear just a suggestion

509
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,960
okay i'll do that yes

510
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,760
hi um this is dieter from nokia uh

511
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
i was wondering um sergio is going to

512
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,679
present the layer zero type extension

513
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,679
drop which is still an individual draft

514
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,400
right now

515
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,159
it's the zero zero version that's going

516
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,520
to be presented later in this session

517
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,679
i think we should also consider a

518
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,600
working group adoption quite quickly

519
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,320
yes i mean that draft is uh

520
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,640
is something that uh all the working

521
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,640
group agreed to work on

522
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,120
uh i mean the the process was agreed by

523
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,919
the working group

524
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,120
so i mean it's something that uh

525
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,320
uh we already consider as adopted

526
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,840
it's uh okay it's cool it's not

527
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,039
a new conclusion coming uh uh

528
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,760
from an individual it's something that

529
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,039
as a working group but we

530
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,880
we decided to have but you remember the

531
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,880
discussion yeah

532
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,960
i was just wondering whether we have to

533
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,720
follow the process here

534
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
carefully so that was just my comment

535
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,360
thanks

536
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,640
you're welcome

537
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,880
so charter update there is uh

538
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,480
uh this is split into two sections

539
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,159
so in the first part uh we highlighted

540
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:00,640
in red

541
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
the thing said that we would like it

542
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,080
what is just

543
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,880
just a specification nothing nothing

544
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,320
particular

545
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,919
uh basically the old child

546
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,520
is saying the working group develops

547
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,960
extension to core

548
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,799
traffic engineering protocols that are

549
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,559
under the care of other working working

550
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,679
groups

551
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,919
we thought it was good that would as

552
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,000
well as a young models for the content

553
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,279
management of new bucket networks

554
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,679
uh including both the devices device

555
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,440
models and network models

556
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,480
so nothing new uh

557
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,440
compared with what we are we just

558
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,159
thought it was a good idea to have

559
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,640
young modelling popping up in the in the

560
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,039
main section of the charter since uh

561
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,440
99 of the work that we are doing today

562
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,559
is young modeling

563
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,679
in the second part

564
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,760
no big change in the working group scope

565
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,320
we were just thinking of removing the

566
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,520
reference to the lime

567
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,919
working group which is now closed

568
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,039
uh and update the list of things that

569
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,360
the working group is working on actually

570
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,039
so protocol extensions and

571
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,320
models for optical for

572
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,159
tdm networks microwave

573
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,360
uh layer one services to cover the

574
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,440
l1 csm cliente topology probably we can

575
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
change these into cliente topologies

576
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,200
and tunnels maybe and then the rest is

577
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,840
unchanged

578
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,520
so maintenance of already specified

579
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,840
extensions and the maintenance of lmp

580
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,120
i see no one in the queue so i assume

581
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,919
everyone is fine with these changes but

582
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,440
once again

583
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,360
this will be brought to the to the main

584
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,480
list for uh

585
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,360
for discussion and then we'll this will

586
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
need the john's approval

587
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
to be to be progressed

588
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,559
please father

589
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,679
so i'm wondering if we also should you

590
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,600
know cover something new or some new

591
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,640
topics in the

592
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,200
chat for example uh slicing stuff right

593
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,960
now we already have one

594
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,840
individual draft you know our discusser

595
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,720
spicing

596
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
you know slicing is a kind of you know

597
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,559
popular topic right

598
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,679
in itf or other seos

599
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,919
but you know right now actually there

600
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,520
are more a lot of

601
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,159
discussions more about the you know

602
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,600
packet slicing but

603
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,360
right now maybe otn or optical networks

604
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,360
could also be applicable to

605
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,559
slicing stuff so so i'm wondering if we

606
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,440
we should cover this or not yeah

607
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,120
good comment yes i think so i mean

608
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,159
nice i agree with you slicing

609
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,760
as a packet as uh as a priority but

610
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,480
for sure there are requests and

611
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,200
requirements

612
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,399
for doing slicing also in non-packeted

613
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,840
technology and then

614
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,520
it follows in in our domain

615
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,840
i agree i agree

616
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,880
okay so this is this is the last one

617
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,760
uh as as we anticipated that we would

618
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,279
like to

619
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,559
close the discussion deborah

620
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,360
i'd say that mic works better um on the

621
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,440
network slicing

622
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,120
i think that's a great idea if i tai

623
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,320
and remember there's two aspects there's

624
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,360
the

625
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,360
for example the gm plus control

626
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,880
and then also from the sdn yang

627
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,159
view and it would be important to

628
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,240
include the multi-layer aspect

629
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,880
yep good point

630
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,760
noted as well

631
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,799
good so

632
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:38,240
last topic young prefixes

633
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,010
so

634
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,880
[Music]

635
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,600
the working group decided to have a

636
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,559
discussion

637
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,840
on alignment of

638
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,039
young prefix prefixes this is an

639
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,240
activity

640
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,600
that is being done

641
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,480
also in conjunction with the t's because

642
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,120
uh

643
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,080
the number of uh modules in common with

644
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,200
them is

645
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,399
is pretty high this is the reason why

646
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,519
we decided to put the two drafts

647
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,570
in the editor queue on old to

648
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,720
[Music]

649
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,159
to the side uh let me say

650
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,279
how to change the the prefixes

651
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,519
use it there to be aligned with the rest

652
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,120
of the work

653
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,159
there were a couple of uh proposals

654
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,039
davison t and ws on top each of which

655
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:33,600
with

656
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,360
with pros and cons uh w zone t

657
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,960
is more aligned with the prefixes used

658
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,320
in by the network topology and the t

659
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,200
topology

660
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,760
rfc 8795 and 8345

661
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,120
which use the prefix dt and nt

662
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,559
so keeping uh in alignment with them

663
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,440
is for sure

664
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,399
nice to have this this has been this is

665
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:04,880
also

666
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,880
uh the preferred solution by teaser

667
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,640
alternatively we can use uh wsom toppo

668
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,760
which is more self-explanatory so it's

669
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,159
uh

670
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,919
easier from from a readability point of

671
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:20,640
view

672
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,399
it's potentially aligned with the w

673
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,919
centennial and the absolute

674
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,279
trl prefix combinations used for

675
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,000
for tunneling

676
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,410
actually my

677
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,840
[Music]

678
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,840
my reading of the working group of

679
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,039
preference

680
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,480
is that the wsnt is is the preferred

681
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,480
choice we have a number

682
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,159
of uh of replies uh

683
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,760
in in this direction so

684
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,919
unless there is any last minute

685
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,840
objection or strong motivation and

686
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,600
obstacle for it

687
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,880
uh i and i have decided to

688
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,159
to proceed with wsnt and we

689
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,520
will uh communicate this to the

690
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,918
uh rfc editor

691
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,280
which is holding old in the pen

692
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,239
for the layer zero types and w's on

693
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:24,879
young

694
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,440
documents

695
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,359
and with that that's it for our long

696
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,839
introduction and we are ready to start

697
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,639
with the

698
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,119
first presentation

699
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,320
which will be given by sergio

700
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,839
if i'm not mistaken

701
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,839
yes okay good okay hello everybody

702
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,160
i'm sergio bellotti from from nokia

703
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,640
i'm going to update the working group

704
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,720
about

705
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,920
optical impairment aware topology

706
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,200
young model on behalf of other

707
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,160
co-authors

708
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,040
and contributors that are here in the

709
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,960
list

710
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,760
second slide

711
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,240
okay so um from the

712
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,240
last itf uh

713
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,960
this is the activity that we made was

714
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,599
the first

715
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,040
ballot is organizational uh

716
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
we work together with the other

717
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,560
co-authors and contributors

718
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,839
and we have a weekly call webex

719
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,440
weekly call now on tuesday so we change

720
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,660
the date from thursday to tuesday

721
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,240
[Music]

722
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,680
then the the topic that we touched

723
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,040
in this period was first

724
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,079
we uh changed

725
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,520
the section 2.5 that was related to the

726
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,119
transponder model part

727
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,880
this section has been updated based on

728
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,200
discussion

729
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,560
and github issues

730
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,160
that we will see in the next

731
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,720
slides

732
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,359
then second ballot

733
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,680
we addressed updating the model

734
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,440
uh with the support of the c plus l

735
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,320
band amplifiers and the third

736
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,440
we made some modification of the young

737
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,400
tree with the

738
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,320
young tree simplification related to the

739
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,520
oms optical multiple section

740
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,200
part of the model in which there was a

741
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,760
redundant information that was

742
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,839
eliminated next

743
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,839
okay so uh there was there was a

744
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:27,599
uh uh there has been a a a a poll

745
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,720
uh taken and uh wanted by

746
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,160
by the chairs after some discussion

747
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,240
uh apollo related to the modes

748
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,000
uh uh used in our model the modes are

749
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,040
the different way in which

750
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,200
the model is dealing with the

751
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,000
transceiver capabilities

752
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,960
and so we have some discussion

753
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,960
about in particular the context of the

754
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,839
organizational mode and the relationship

755
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,680
with the

756
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,839
interoperability concept uh

757
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,480
for this reason there was a poll the

758
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,200
poll

759
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,480
uh was that the chisel was to

760
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,000
take the young as it is because there

761
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,839
was no need to change that

762
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,520
but to add some text

763
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,040
to and better

764
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,720
clarify the scope of the drafts

765
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,200
related to the interoperability concept

766
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,839
and

767
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,680
the same way to expand a bit

768
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,880
the text related to uh specifically for

769
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,079
the organizational mode so

770
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,280
a text has been introduced about in the

771
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,680
in the introduction has been

772
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,760
added a test uh clarifying the fact that

773
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,320
the optical data play interoperability

774
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,240
is is a complex task

775
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,359
that is uh

776
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,560
usually requires some let me say

777
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,560
join engineering and there is a

778
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,320
outside the scope of this draft

779
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,720
the scope of the draft has to be very

780
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,000
clear is

781
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,520
to provide the needed information

782
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,079
to support optical impairment away path

783
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,839
computation

784
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,280
um then uh

785
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,160
following some comments that uh you can

786
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,560
see

787
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,760
uh easily in the github uh

788
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,599
have been expanded the text from

789
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,880
the section 2.502 about organizational

790
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
mode

791
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,160
also here provide clarification about

792
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,480
interoperability

793
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,640
and provide clarify

794
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,800
their role the precedence

795
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
related to the the

796
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,599
the fact that the the modes

797
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,800
subsume some basic attributes

798
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,240
the the basic attributes related to the

799
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,800
uh the system apart

800
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,160
the optical power and and frequency

801
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,200
range

802
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,240
and these attributes can be explicit or

803
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,319
implicit given in the in the model

804
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,520
and the text clarified

805
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,880
the precedence and how to use that

806
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,400
in the context of the modes

807
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,200
the the last uh has been updated

808
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,760
uh the mode related to the standard

809
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,920
uh the so set standard mode uh

810
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,480
specifying uh better the text

811
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,839
and the fact that with application code

812
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,079
actually with the itu-t

813
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:05,119
aligned with the itu-t g609.2.1 sorry

814
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,200
the the data plane interoperability is

815
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,920
guaranteed

816
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,240
on the other side the important point is

817
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,640
that this standard mode for the moment

818
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,760
is pointing just the iqt

819
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,560
specification because is the only one

820
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,359
that

821
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,760
are present in the moment in the market

822
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,520
but nothing prevent

823
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,720
from the model to consider other

824
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,640
standard mode standard specification

825
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,760
as soon as they can be presented on the

826
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,280
market

827
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,079
next slide

828
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,319
hello next

829
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,480
okay so uh the second point that we

830
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,599
address is the

831
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,480
for the young update we

832
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,920
added the part related to the uh

833
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,520
c plus l band amplifier

834
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,280
so uh the c plus cell abandoned

835
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,480
our amplifier are physically

836
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,000
uh two amplifier uh

837
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,280
that are both part of the of the same

838
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,640
type of amplifier but are characterized

839
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,520
by different

840
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,880
uh attributes related to the band

841
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,240
the gain noise of figures and others

842
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,078
so we the model

843
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,920
we thought to solve this issue

844
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,359
and to update the model uh for any

845
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,560
uh type of amplifier we added a list

846
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,520
of amplifier

847
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,800
that are part always of the same

848
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,680
type of amplifier with all the

849
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,720
attributes

850
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,839
and the related frequency range of

851
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,880
operation

852
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,240
that characterized

853
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,520
one amplifier belonging to the same

854
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,640
class

855
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,839
and you can characterize if uh

856
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,200
this frequency range is uh belonging to

857
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,400
the c band or

858
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,760
l band uh we have used

859
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,119
a list and not just a pair of amplifiers

860
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,200
because we wanted to be future safe for

861
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,640
possible evolution for band amplifiers

862
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
next

863
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,480
okay we simplify the

864
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,480
young model in the trees because

865
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,319
we observe

866
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,520
that within the part of the model

867
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,920
related to the optical multiple section

868
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,480
for the

869
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,760
oms element list

870
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,880
the model was presenting

871
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,800
the redundancy information to select

872
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,920
the type of element

873
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,119
and this redundancy has been removed

874
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,160
so we have removed the yellow part that

875
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,640
i

876
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,680
i represented in the extract

877
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,359
from the young so we deleted the type

878
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,599
and element because in in the choice

879
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,640
is already there the container that

880
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,319
characterized the type of oms element so

881
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,200
amplifier

882
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,440
or fiber span or attenuators

883
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,480
then we have also added

884
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,000
uh we changed the name for the oed to

885
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,520
clarify better the context of the od so

886
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,280
this is oms

887
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,160
element 2d

888
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
next

889
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,400
so we we have we take the

890
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,319
the track of the open issue uh

891
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,640
uh in the link that i reported here

892
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,680
so you can uh understand the issue

893
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,560
discussion

894
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,599
and what are the resolution

895
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,040
linked to the young model uh we have

896
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:34,480
closed the 10 issues from the last itf

897
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:35,599
meeting

898
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,720
uh we are still have 17 issue

899
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,839
but from this 17 uh

900
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,359
only three are a real

901
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,839
young needed enhancement

902
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,960
from the prospective optical impairments

903
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,400
topology model we have

904
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,599
four out of them that uh

905
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,880
ever been already identified solution

906
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,160
it's just a matter of time we

907
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,119
will not be able to address that before

908
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,079
at the itf

909
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,359
but we know how to do that and so

910
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,440
we'll be addressing with the next young

911
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,359
model comet

912
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,240
uh there are two uh issues that are

913
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,280
editorial

914
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,319
uh there is a review terminology

915
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,599
internal and

916
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,720
uh some alignment with the g807

917
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,440
itu-t three are related to question for

918
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,040
clarification

919
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,480
and uh three are a request

920
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,720
to remove some part some news grouping

921
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,240
we know that young daughters

922
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,000
don't want to have a grouping that are

923
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,359
in use or use just one only one so we

924
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:54,560
try to

925
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,000
follow these rules so we need to uh

926
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,200
understand uh uh

927
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,880
if this grouping can be used uh

928
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,960
in the future or not and uh

929
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,040
and so that the issue has to be

930
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,920
investigated

931
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,118
next

932
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,760
so one of the issues is

933
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,119
sorry question what are the

934
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,359
questions for clarification is this

935
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,240
something

936
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,479
that

937
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,040
did the working group can have a say

938
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,240
i don't know there are some

939
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,079
uh there are three issues that

940
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,440
are practically uh ask

941
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,280
uh more specific

942
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,720
some part of the the drafts

943
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,800
uh of the of the model um

944
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,440
for example i don't know one one

945
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
question is related to

946
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,640
the future or method of the zitar

947
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,559
uh specification related to the model

948
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,800
uh so this type of question so

949
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,400
is is not strictly related to the

950
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,839
to the young part but is a more

951
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,280
general question let me say uh that

952
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,160
the group uh us to clarify

953
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,000
okay so i i i would

954
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,280
think uh that it could be useful

955
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,720
for in this case is that to have uh

956
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,359
uh i don't know a summary every so often

957
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,200
on the main list to say

958
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,760
guys please uh we would need the eureto

959
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,480
with these

960
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,480
uh two three items because

961
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,280
uh i mean i'm i'm not sure that everyone

962
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:55,599
would

963
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,440
go periodically and check the open

964
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,960
issues on uh

965
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,880
on github sort of uh

966
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,400
asking asking for uh review of

967
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,079
particular things you mean just for the

968
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,319
for the the for the three of one or uh

969
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,720
i'm referring those are the ones that we

970
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,839
where the working group

971
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,640
could provide the more help immediately

972
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,119
but

973
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,520
obviously not limited to just to them

974
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,680
okay we will take into account

975
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,480
for next time

976
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,880
okay so uh one of the issue uh

977
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,319
is related to the extension of the

978
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,160
uh the model to support the t

979
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,520
c plus l band amplifier

980
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,000
um c plus l band not only for amplifier

981
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,040
but

982
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,839
for the other network component and in

983
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:00,480
particular

984
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,160
for uh related to the rodum so

985
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,280
the group started already to discuss

986
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,839
how to extend the model uh to deal with

987
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,319
that and

988
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,640
uh related to the extension for rhodam

989
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,839
uh have been raised an issue

990
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,359
a potential issue uh

991
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:28,160
due to the fact that uh they

992
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,440
really there is a let me say

993
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,079
some problem with respect what are the

994
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,119
abstraction

995
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,240
topology model following that is topo

996
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,720
and

997
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,760
following what is proposing the young

998
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,280
with respect to the real physical

999
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,160
implementation

1000
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:51,280
uh and so the the the point is that

1001
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,680
and you can see in the picture on the

1002
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,440
right side there is a

1003
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,480
what are the structure in the rhodum

1004
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,319
related in the mesh part

1005
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,160
with the booster and plumpifier

1006
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,440
and and

1007
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,480
from from this from the topology model

1008
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,680
and on the left is the mapping of what

1009
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,160
is the

1010
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,559
the real equipment part and so the

1011
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,520
problem is that

1012
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,680
uh there is uh some

1013
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,720
from a booster and pre-amplifier

1014
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,839
we have a multiple input output port

1015
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,079
from the the rodent part

1016
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,079
and you can see that on the ball the

1017
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,200
green

1018
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,400
bullet the green circle

1019
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,319
in the drone uh so

1020
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,760
it is clear that

1021
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,240
is the model is already providing an

1022
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,160
extracted view of the physical

1023
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,520
implementation

1024
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,680
and there is no issue

1025
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,000
[Music]

1026
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,680
going from the physical implementation

1027
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,800
and to from controller prospective to

1028
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,760
expose

1029
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,960
the abstracted part

1030
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,160
from the left to the to the right

1031
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,319
because of the amplifi the model per

1032
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:19,760
meter without problem

1033
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,960
to distinguish the amplifier

1034
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,640
so we have linkedid amplifier id

1035
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,000
to identify a plum amplifier

1036
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,520
but the problem is if

1037
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,559
from abstracted part enter in the

1038
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,599
uh there is the need to map on the

1039
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,520
equipment on the on the real

1040
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,920
implementation

1041
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,119
so the the the point we need

1042
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,559
just to be clear is not impacting

1043
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,839
at all the issue 51 so

1044
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,960
we have discussion and we can progress

1045
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,000
on to extend the model also for

1046
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,119
rhodam but it's just a question from the

1047
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,839
working group

1048
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,079
about the fact that is not the first

1049
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:10,640
time

1050
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,079
that the issue on the mapping between

1051
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,359
the abstract view to the uh

1052
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,520
on the others on the on the physical

1053
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,040
implementation

1054
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,559
is is been raising uh

1055
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,280
not only for optical impairment but also

1056
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,200
another discussion

1057
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,800
so uh the grooves talked

1058
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,240
that would be good to put

1059
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,119
the question on the on the the list and

1060
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,000
so on the working group

1061
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,720
if it is needed to have a standardized

1062
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,680
rule

1063
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:50,160
uh needed to map the topological port

1064
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,440
and the in the physical

1065
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,040
rodent ports

1066
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,040
and to solve the issue

1067
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,720
we could have two way one way is

1068
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,400
to adding additional attributes

1069
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,599
or defining uh a

1070
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,880
specific naming rule uh for for

1071
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,559
for existing attributes so for example i

1072
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,440
don't know uh

1073
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,880
to concatenate the two level of the two

1074
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,400
ports uh

1075
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,839
mapping on the uh on the

1076
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,280
um abstract uh port

1077
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,720
uh on the um preamplifier

1078
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,319
booster so uh

1079
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,119
this is uh uh the question for the

1080
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,880
working group

1081
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,240
uh and uh but

1082
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,680
again this is not impacted uh

1083
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,839
the the the solution of the issue

1084
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,040
from modem in perspective

1085
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,000
okay next

1086
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,359
okay next uh for the next step we

1087
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:10,559
wanted obviously to address uh the other

1088
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,760
open issue

1089
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,440
and solving them uh

1090
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,040
we have or we are already ongoing on the

1091
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,720
activity to extend

1092
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,760
the rhoda model to support c plus

1093
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,440
l band and

1094
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,680
we need to specify triad generator

1095
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,280
based on optical transponder model

1096
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,440
and we want to be ready for young doctor

1097
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,359
review

1098
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:44,880
for uh we hope for for a

1099
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,839
next itf

1100
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,280
okay very good next time

1101
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:03,839
any question

1102
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:11,200
so uh actually i i

1103
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,760
read a distribution of this draft and

1104
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,520
and i see there's a change

1105
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,079
to the price of the application codes

1106
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:18,640
with

1107
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,319
standard modes so i actually think this

1108
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,799
is a good idea and i support it

1109
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:27,680
but i also have another comment so in

1110
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,799
the body of the

1111
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:31,440
main body of this draft it says the

1112
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,559
young model

1113
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,119
defines three different approach to

1114
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,720
describe the transceiver

1115
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,559
ability so i think this description is

1116
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,440
very good but

1117
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,720
i to avoid any confusion

1118
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,440
i also would like to suggest that we

1119
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,680
should add some text

1120
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,440
to uh describe uh explicitly something

1121
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,720
like

1122
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,960
uh it does a lot of the choir and

1123
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,000
implementation

1124
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,200
must support three-year approach right

1125
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,599
which means that an application and

1126
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,960
implementation

1127
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,480
could only support one or two

1128
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,000
approach is my understanding it's

1129
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,720
correct or not

1130
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,520
the um i think the model

1131
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,799
permitted to describe the

1132
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,880
transceiver capability in different

1133
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,920
modes but does not

1134
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,079
imply that the system and implementation

1135
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,559
need to support all of the three sure

1136
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,960
yeah so i mean it's better for us so

1137
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,799
some text because

1138
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,240
yeah describe this kind of thing

1139
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,480
explicitly

1140
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:48,880
your voice is disappear at least for me

1141
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,559
you cannot hear me clearly

1142
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,559
okay i would like to look it i

1143
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,640
understand what you just uh you know uh

1144
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,720
said so i mean um we should add some

1145
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,079
text

1146
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,000
to describe something uh explicitly

1147
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,839
to avoid some confusion

1148
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,799
okay so you want to add text to

1149
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,839
uh underline the fact that is not

1150
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,119
implied to support every mode this is

1151
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,160
what you're right

1152
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,079
right yes right yeah

1153
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,280
okay okay thank you

1154
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,880
any other comments about the

1155
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:50,160
topic the issue that i raised

1156
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,640
okay and i would proceed with the next

1157
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,640
okay uh i'm again

1158
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,559
sergio belotti so uh these uh

1159
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,160
i'm going to present the

1160
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,559
new drafts that is the layer zero

1161
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,839
type extension uh that

1162
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,839
uh

1163
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,640
please next next slide

1164
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,520
so this this

1165
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,599
draft is has been provided

1166
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,720
after the discussion that we had

1167
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,319
uh some months ago

1168
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,599
about the fact that the

1169
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,359
layer zero type

1170
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,640
has been reducing the scope before the

1171
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,400
publication

1172
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,240
just dealing with just covering

1173
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:00,720
spectrum management aspects

1174
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,960
the intention was to stabilize let me

1175
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,280
say

1176
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,280
the layer zero type and permit to

1177
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,440
speed up the process of publication

1178
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,640
of the layer zero type and the

1179
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,240
related layer zero topology that

1180
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,680
has dependency on that so in particular

1181
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,040
is the itf was on topology

1182
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,720
to permit this process

1183
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,400
they has been created this document

1184
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,079
that practically complements the content

1185
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,160
of layer zero type

1186
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,839
try to reconciling um

1187
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:49,440
all this the the technical

1188
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,559
uh technical uh

1189
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,079
structure the young structure uh

1190
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,119
that was related to transponder model

1191
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,480
that was spread

1192
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,160
in different uh different uh

1193
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,599
drafts present in c camp

1194
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,960
and with the intention to

1195
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,880
create a common uh

1196
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,799
common collection of young structure and

1197
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:23,440
definition that can be used

1198
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,200
by all the other

1199
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,440
w zone of flexible grid and obviously

1200
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,799
the wdm interface model that

1201
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:39,119
is a very close and complementary of

1202
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,400
optical impairment topology model

1203
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:47,200
um the life cycle of this draft

1204
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,480
is being will be practical in parallel

1205
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,599
of draft itf

1206
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,640
layer 0 type

1207
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,760
will be updated with the content of

1208
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,799
the layer 0 type

1209
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,359
as soon as it will reach the publication

1210
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,400
and in that case we'll change again the

1211
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,680
name on layer 0 type

1212
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,839
and then we the intention is that

1213
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,599
this layer 0 type will proceed with a

1214
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,720
v2 version of

1215
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,920
and to have a new rfc

1216
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,520
containing all the part that

1217
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,359
was in the previous layer 0 type plus

1218
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,359
the the new one

1219
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,359
next slide the

1220
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,359
so what i summarize by words

1221
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,680
is we try to express with these lights

1222
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,440
that should provide what would be the

1223
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,880
process

1224
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,920
of uh layer zero type

1225
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,960
uh and bouzon

1226
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,319
the green part is the one that

1227
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,319
is already in the acg process and so

1228
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,760
uh they would we would like to

1229
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,839
proceed towards the publication and

1230
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,880
then there is a parallel process

1231
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,280
related to the layer 0 type extension

1232
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:29,760
and the creation of layer 0

1233
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,039
type version 2 as soon as the

1234
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,400
layer 0 type reach

1235
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,000
the rfc and then

1236
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,559
the procedure of the layer 0 type

1237
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,240
version 2

1238
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,640
till the the the publication

1239
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,280
as well with encompassing

1240
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,960
the new part related to the layer 0 type

1241
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,760
extension

1242
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:02,000
and all the parts that

1243
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,680
was in the layer 0 type version 1.

1244
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,480
next um

1245
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,480
about the other layer 0

1246
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,760
draft that

1247
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,240
are present in c camp there are some

1248
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,440
that can follow the same path

1249
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,480
as w zone topology and optical

1250
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,480
impairment as

1251
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,319
drawn in the slides for example the

1252
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,480
flexible grid topology

1253
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,079
is pretty stable version

1254
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,319
and even if it is not yet in the ecg

1255
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:52,000
process this is why i haven't put that

1256
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,400
in the slides before

1257
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,520
is in the stable situation

1258
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,799
so we can presume that can

1259
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,760
follow the same part rw zone topology

1260
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:06,720
using layer

1261
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,160
zero type version 1 in the process to

1262
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:10,960
become

1263
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,039
rsc instead other

1264
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,799
document like flexible grid tunnel

1265
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:23,119
w zone tunnel or interface model

1266
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,160
that are not yet in sdgs approaches

1267
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:29,440
we can advance that for them we have

1268
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,280
approaches

1269
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:37,039
using layer 0 type extension

1270
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,480
version 2 like

1271
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,839
what we depicted for optical impairments

1272
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,520
this type of procedure obviously

1273
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,079
does not prevent theoretically to

1274
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:53,760
introduce also

1275
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:57,839
in case we need a layer 0 type

1276
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,599
v3 in

1277
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,920
case some time discrepancies can happen

1278
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,359
upon among different drafts no in the in

1279
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,400
the rfc process

1280
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,359
next

1281
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,440
okay uh we have discussed before

1282
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,200
uh danielle said that is uh uh

1283
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,720
considered like uh uh an

1284
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,599
adoption automatic adoption but okay we

1285
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:30,559
we

1286
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,720
would like to have a working group

1287
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,839
adoption for

1288
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:36,880
for these drafts and uh

1289
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,400
obviously uh the the draft

1290
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:44,480
as to add other uh young structure

1291
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,920
as needed as soon as the other

1292
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,359
uh layer zero young model uh need to

1293
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:54,480
have the new grouping that can be

1294
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,680
hosted in this uh in this

1295
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,520
collector like layer 0 type extension

1296
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,920
model

1297
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,880
i'm

1298
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,839
this is all for my okay thank you

1299
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,240
yeah i mean this this is a draft that

1300
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,359
was requested

1301
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:19,200
by aza so we we could uh

1302
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,839
uh we could have it directly published

1303
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,000
as a working group drafter but i mean

1304
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,079
no one prevents us to follow to follow

1305
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,200
the path things

1306
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,880
that the classical standard process so

1307
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,319
we will issue a short working group

1308
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,680
adoption poll okay so you

1309
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,799
you think to have a an adult from paul

1310
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,839
normally and then change yes

1311
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,520
a short one okay maybe

1312
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,079
one week instead of uh classical two

1313
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,640
three weeks

1314
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,280
omiana

1315
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,480
uh i i i should mention this later sorry

1316
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,039
sergio

1317
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,960
that i noticed sometimes we are using

1318
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,559
version two sometimes we are using

1319
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,960
revision2 and sometimes we are using

1320
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:10,160
a dash with ext calling for extension

1321
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,240
so uh i can imagine some problems for

1322
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,839
future extension because

1323
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:18,560
today the layer one sorry the layer zero

1324
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,839
types

1325
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,238
version one is in rfc editor queue and

1326
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:22,880
we

1327
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,080
create this kind of this error zero

1328
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:29,359
types ext so

1329
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,520
i'm not sure how to name the next one if

1330
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,719
this there there

1331
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,040
type c ext is in the editors queue and

1332
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,120
we want to create the next one

1333
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,040
so i would suggest that we rename it

1334
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,399
it as a dash v2

1335
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,920
for globally of this work including the

1336
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,120
module the draft

1337
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,719
name and somewhere else

1338
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,839
you mean dash v2

1339
01:08:55,839 --> 01:09:00,719
uh this one a dash v2 yeah for

1340
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,198
uh to to replace the dash ext

1341
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:10,879
okay okay okay

1342
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,319
italo please

1343
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,359
i think if understand quality the idea

1344
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,520
is that this document

1345
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,479
this module will not go to our cs xt we

1346
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,359
should go

1347
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,880
as a revision of layer zero types god

1348
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,960
maybe we can but i'm okay

1349
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,880
so we should we should not have major

1350
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,319
issues in the long term

1351
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,359
it's just something to do now once we

1352
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,640
have two drafts

1353
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,319
in progress in different stages uh

1354
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:49,439
yeah you you are correct little because

1355
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,719
they are

1356
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,960
the intention at least also from my

1357
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,080
understanding was

1358
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,239
that uh as soon as the layer zero type

1359
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:00,719
reached the publication

1360
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,760
now then this one this

1361
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,760
extension came back to layer zero type

1362
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,600
uh name but uh well

1363
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,760
the name we can just see decide what

1364
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,360
is the better one yeah but i mean that's

1365
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,880
something that we can decide at the

1366
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,880
later stage also together

1367
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,400
we are not to understand if abuse

1368
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,520
is the right approach or

1369
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,480
or whatever we can we can discuss it at

1370
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,660
later stage now we can focus

1371
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:36,080
[Music]

1372
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,360
on the content next one

1373
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,960
should be done if i'm not mistaken

1374
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,840
hi thank you

1375
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,920
so this is a very short update on the

1376
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:50,880
flexi grid

1377
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,560
uh yang models that that we've been

1378
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,960
working on um we've combined

1379
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,040
uh both documents into a single

1380
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,000
presentation so i'll start with the

1381
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,199
yang model for sort of flexigrid

1382
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,679
uh topology and then conclude with the

1383
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:06,560
young model for

1384
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:09,520
flexi grid tunnels or sorry media

1385
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,199
channels

1386
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,080
uh next slide please danielle ah there

1387
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,120
we go

1388
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,760
so essentially uh this is a document

1389
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,800
that describes

1390
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,600
uh how to model our flexigrid uh

1391
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,360
topology network

1392
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,120
essentially we've got uh a number of

1393
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,320
dependencies that

1394
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,480
that sort of slowed down some of the

1395
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,320
work including the

1396
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,679
um tea topology

1397
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,320
we've also got some dependencies as uh

1398
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,080
sergio just highlighted

1399
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,960
with the layer zero types and also sort

1400
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,719
of optical impairment

1401
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,239
uh that said we feel the document is now

1402
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:51,120
stable uh there were a few sort of uh

1403
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,040
minor issues that that we're waiting for

1404
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,400
the working group to

1405
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,199
address including uh the the prefix

1406
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,480
discussion

1407
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,159
um we've also uh updated

1408
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:05,280
um the security section and has

1409
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,960
clarified

1410
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,040
our references and sort of separating

1411
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,000
them into

1412
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,440
uh clear normative and informative

1413
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,600
documents that that maybe someone would

1414
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,360
want to look at

1415
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,000
in terms of sort of implementation

1416
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,120
aspects

1417
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,880
and of course like most of the other

1418
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,199
documents we tend to

1419
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,560
track the code to the xml

1420
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,400
version of the document and also all the

1421
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,600
open issues

1422
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,360
using a github repository

1423
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,000
we do feel that the document is now

1424
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,800
ready for

1425
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,600
uh working group last call we had two

1426
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,560
fairly

1427
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,760
comprehensive uh reviews thank you

1428
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,199
uh haumean and adrian they posted

1429
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:50,880
their reviews directly to the list and

1430
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,880
so we've addressed those

1431
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,480
and i think the chairs already

1432
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,000
highlighted that we are

1433
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,360
also queued for a young doctor review

1434
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,480
as well so

1435
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,760
next slide please great

1436
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,800
so then the the second document is

1437
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,679
our flexigrid media channel i suppose

1438
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,000
it's

1439
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,480
it's worth reminding uh the working

1440
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,040
group

1441
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:17,199
that this is work that started

1442
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:18,400
approximately

1443
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,960
like approximately three years ago so

1444
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,159
it's it's it's

1445
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:25,440
um yeah we wouldn't call it historic but

1446
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,640
it's certainly been

1447
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,760
um queued for a while

1448
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,560
the the focus was on the topology

1449
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,880
especially as we

1450
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,120
initially kind of mixed some of the

1451
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,040
media channel discussion in the topology

1452
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,560
documentation and that's been

1453
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,600
removed and separated into uh the media

1454
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,120
channel specific

1455
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,640
uh at the document we have

1456
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,000
done a full refresh um i suppose

1457
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,840
uh we could see this as a restart

1458
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,520
actually uh of

1459
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,360
of the document it hadn't you know we

1460
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,440
hadn't had a new revision for at least

1461
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,880
18 months

1462
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,920
so i would uh request that the working

1463
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,679
group sort of does take a look

1464
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,040
at the current version we have

1465
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,480
uh now aligned the document with some of

1466
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,360
the

1467
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,640
the other existing um work as well

1468
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,120
uh trying to sort of import as much as

1469
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:19,760
possible

1470
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,960
there are of course uh some some ongoing

1471
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,440
uh issues and i'll sort of get onto

1472
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,080
those in

1473
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,360
a couple of moments uh i would

1474
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,199
uh also ask um the working group to

1475
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,320
uh uh

1476
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:39,120
well let me rephrase that if there are

1477
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,239
implementers

1478
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,120
uh beyond the document authors uh who

1479
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,199
are going to be implementing it or have

1480
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,280
already implemented uh we would like to

1481
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,360
hear about it because um

1482
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,400
currently we've only got sort of two uh

1483
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,199
confirmed implementations of the the

1484
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,560
flexi grit

1485
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,120
yang documents next slide please

1486
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,520
good so in summary we have a number of

1487
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,600
open issues and i i do sort of

1488
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,760
uh take on board what danielle mentioned

1489
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:13,120
earlier which is we

1490
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,800
we have to be careful that we don't

1491
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,199
end up developing and reaching

1492
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:20,640
conclusions

1493
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,239
in isolation uh in github rather that

1494
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:27,199
we use github for tracking but we bring

1495
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,360
specific sort of technical open issues

1496
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,360
to the list and make sure that you know

1497
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,800
we're following uh

1498
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,040
working group process rather than

1499
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:35,840
absolutely

1500
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,440
doing everything in isolation so that's

1501
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,440
that's really important and i will

1502
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,000
i'll drop an email later today to the

1503
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:42,560
list

1504
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,440
just to highlight the open issues that

1505
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,080
we currently have and those include

1506
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,000
uh working with operators just to uh

1507
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,640
develop a use case uh that that that we

1508
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,520
may use

1509
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,120
um to help with the uh the yang model

1510
01:15:59,120 --> 01:15:59,760
itself

1511
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,000
and if it's useful we'll leave it in the

1512
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,199
document if it's not

1513
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,760
um maybe we will remove it or just move

1514
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,920
it to an appendix

1515
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:11,040
as we've seen um with sergio's previous

1516
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,560
presentation you know there's some

1517
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,080
sort of uh uh discussion

1518
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,000
decision making that needs to be done in

1519
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,520
terms of what

1520
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,960
we specify in this document or

1521
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,360
do we actually move some of the

1522
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,360
attributes into

1523
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,440
the l0 tunnel attributes

1524
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,880
or l0 types extensions and just import

1525
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,719
instead and i think i think it's

1526
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,320
actually the latter i think we're just

1527
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,239
going to import but that's a decision we

1528
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,360
need to make

1529
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,280
uh as a as a a group of authors

1530
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,560
uh we we are looking to

1531
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,280
maintain momentum now with with the

1532
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:51,920
discussion

1533
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,440
around flexi grid uh by having a

1534
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,880
a a weekly zoom call

1535
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,000
and that is open and anyone is uh

1536
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,840
welcome to attend that we will

1537
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,560
report kind of conclusion and updates as

1538
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,159
frequently as possible to the list

1539
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,440
as well and just one request why we have

1540
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:12,320
the attention

1541
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,120
of the chairs and the secretary if we

1542
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,080
could add

1543
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,520
two additional uh contributors to the

1544
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,480
c camp github repository for the

1545
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,000
flexibility media channel uh they're

1546
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,760
listed on the slide here i have sent an

1547
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,560
email i didn't get a response back yet

1548

okay if not we can move

1559
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,520
to the next presentation

1560
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:15,199
which is number four an update on the

1561
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:18,239
otn models

1562
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,320
a quick time check

1563
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,040
it's uh

1564
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,000
we are almost 15 minutes late

1565
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,800
but we have a buffer over 15 minutes at

1566
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,880
the end of the session so

1567
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,440
we can see we are perfectly on time but

1568
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,560
uh

1569
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,640
from now on please try to um

1570
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,800
adhere to to to your time slot

1571
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,000
please um okay thank you danielle

1572
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,560
so this is hamil from huawei and i'm

1573
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,560
going to give some update on

1574
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,400
a group of otm models and the first one

1575
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,199
is layer 1 types next please

1576
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,640
so now we have been updating to version

1577
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,239
10 and the objective

1578
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,360
of this document is to specify the

1579
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,679
common used identities groupings and

1580
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:14,800
type definitions

1581
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,080
used in their one networks then nowadays

1582
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,040
only okay the most most popular one is

1583
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,000
otn

1584
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,280
so we have

1585
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,480
list out okay the the most uh frequently

1586
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,040
used

1587
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:32,400
uh groupings uh in this slide

1588
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,640
including the link bandwidth and pass

1589
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,159
bandwidth and

1590
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,360
for labor related groupings so

1591
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,280
they will they will be used

1592
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,400
multiple times when augmenting the

1593
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,679
otn topologies and not internals to

1594
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,520
to the generic tea topology and tunnels

1595
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,360
so we have next please

1596
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,440
so we have added some text descriptions

1597
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,400
on the specified groupings and how to

1598
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,520
what they mean

1599
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,880
how to use them and we also clean up the

1600
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,520
reference

1601
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,840
in both the draft and the modules to

1602
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,719
make sure that

1603
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,760
each of the parameters in the grouping

1604
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,040
have

1605
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,719
have a kind of data plan supporting from

1606
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,440
the other recommendation like g thought

1607
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,719
709

1608
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,960
and we also addressed the comments from

1609
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,239
the young doctors review

1610
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,600
and the comments from the mailing list

1611
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,400
so next please

1612
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,600
so okay the authors are thinking that

1613
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,480
the

1614
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:43,440
the the module is now stable and we are

1615
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,440
ready for working group class call

1616
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,880
but as i was aware earlier in the in the

1617
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:49,600
beginning

1618
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,600
session that the young doctor review has

1619
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,320
been quite many versions ago

1620
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,000
so so uh maybe we also need

1621
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,679
another young doctor review it depends

1622
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,520
on the on the chair's positioning

1623
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,239
but if we do another uh young doctor

1624
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,440
review i would suggest

1625
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,120
we do a joint review with ot

1626
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,120
anthropology and tunnel because they are

1627
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,159
highly dependent

1628
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,120
yeah i mean even if it's an old one i'm

1629
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,679
not

1630
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:17,880
this this is a pretty simple and

1631
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,760
straightforward model

1632
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,760
and we already have a lot of indications

1633
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:22,960
on the l0

1634
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,400
or zero title from uh

1635
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,600
from robert so i i would be

1636
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,600
comfortable to progress the draft also

1637
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,199
without a a

1638
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:37,120
another uh uh another round of young

1639
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,560
doctor review

1640
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,320
also let me say from from a practical

1641
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,719
point of view also not trying it not to

1642
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:45,679
overload them

1643
01:21:45,679 --> 01:21:48,880
with a lot of work

1644
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,560
because we have other other drafts

1645
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,719
that need a more thorough review so

1646
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,480
um i mean i

1647
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,040
i would tend to think that the the the

1648
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:04,239
review that we have had

1649
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:08,960
so far is more than enough to proceed

1650
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,199
what what what do you think do you think

1651
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:12,239
right

1652
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,880
in the major changes that require

1653
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,320
another review

1654
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,360
or uh or not uh not necessary

1655
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,560
not necessary okay i think we can yeah

1656
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,880
we can continue

1657
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,280
very good

1658
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,360
okay and next would be the update of the

1659
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,719
ot topology

1660
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:38,000
next please

1661
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,040
uh so here yeah here we list the

1662
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,239
summary of our changes from last itf

1663
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:47,760
uh okay most of the groupings have been

1664
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,280
moved to layer one types

1665
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,400
and here we just left

1666
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:55,920
left a a field over there but

1667
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,880
now we now we added the descriptions

1668
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,600
about the

1669
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,840
grouping usage when you collecting the

1670
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,400
topology because this is the

1671
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:08,000
the topology model we also

1672
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,199
prepared for the working group last call

1673
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:12,880
by cleaning up the security

1674
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,239
considerations

1675
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,960
and this is done by harmonizing with rfc

1676
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:21,199
8795 which is the t topology

1677
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:24,880
and also we harmonize the

1678
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,040
young module with the latest layer 1

1679
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,080
types so

1680
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,920
now they are in a good relationship

1681
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,440
next please

1682
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:37,360
oh this is a rather independent one

1683
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,480
because i was wondering

1684
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,080
i was wondering whether we talked about

1685
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,679
the previous prefix

1686
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:45,679
in in the working group session but it

1687
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:47,600
seems to we solve the problem for

1688
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,960
for the pre prefix selection for

1689
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:51,760
topology

1690
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,520
and for the audient topology we will use

1691
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,440
otnt with the same w song

1692
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:02,639
style but another question would be what

1693
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:03,280
would be

1694
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,040
used for the tunnel it should be this

1695
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,120
should be listed in the in the next

1696
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,920
draft but i put them together so now

1697
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,679
there's potential options

1698
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,280
uh include the wsong

1699
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,320
uh dash tunnel

1700
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,520
and the w sound here or w sound dash tnr

1701
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,440
tnr is a kind of

1702
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,759
abbreviation for tunnel so

1703
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:29,120
[Music]

1704
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,280
i think we will we we may skip the w

1705
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,120
sound dash tunnel for

1706
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,000
full spelling given that we choose w

1707
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,520
sound t

1708
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,280
so but we may decide which one

1709
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:44,320
to use uh the one with hyphen

1710
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,600
or the one without so to to make sure

1711
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,960
that we

1712
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,080
we proceed to the tunnel model

1713
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,280
easier which which one is used

1714
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,480
in uh the t

1715
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:02,000
e tunnel uh model

1716
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,280
do you remember by heart i would say

1717
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,679
they didn't mention the tunnel the full

1718
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,080
name of

1719
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,520
okay so it doesn't help

1720
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,159
yeah but we may yeah we may mention this

1721
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:22,159
too to tease as well

1722
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:25,280
uh okay so so okay the the next

1723
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:29,199
two discussions is less urgent compared

1724
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:32,000
with the previous two but i think uh

1725
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,880
flex

1726
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,080
uh flexigrade topology and tunnel

1727
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,239
and ethernet topology and tunnel

1728
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:43,840
i would suggest to use consistent prefix

1729
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,159
all together next please

1730
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:54,239
so okay so there has been young doctor

1731
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:54,960
review

1732
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,920
uh maybe one or two versions ago and we

1733
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,800
all the

1734
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,800
uh we saw we addressed all the young

1735
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,400
doctor review comments and

1736
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,280
uh uh we are requesting for the working

1737
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,400
group last call

1738
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,760
probably after we decide the the prefix

1739
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:12,320
the module is available on github and we

1740
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,280
also suggest to

1741
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,400
cluster this work with the layer one

1742
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:21,199
types like what we did for layer 0 and

1743
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,440
sum

1744
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,800
so should i continue or we have any

1745
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:37,440
discussions in previous one

1746
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,600
i don't see anyone in the cube so i

1747
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,320
think we can continue

1748
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:44,800
okay thank you so the next one would be

1749
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,880
audient tunnel

1750
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,840
next please

1751
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,679
uh yeah this one we tweaked a lot of

1752
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:59,120
the of the text because we rewrote

1753
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,000
the text in abstraction and we revise

1754
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,639
the text

1755
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,920
in security consideration to align with

1756
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,880
the latest

1757
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,679
generic tunnel models and we also

1758
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:14,159
do some initial young model changes by

1759
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,239
removing the source and destination

1760
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:19,199
client signal as well have we are now

1761
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:20,239
having a separate

1762
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:22,400
client signal module so so this one

1763
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,560
these two should be removed

1764
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,639
uh i said this is the initial young

1765
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,719
module changes because

1766
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,360
the there is a big task that we need to

1767
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,719
align with

1768
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:35,440
the itft which is a moving target from

1769
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,719
the day so

1770
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:39,360
next please

1771
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,040
so yeah so we we

1772
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,840
we talked with the authors and we

1773
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,400
believe

1774
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,239
it would be better to align with the

1775
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:51,679
generic team models

1776
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:56,080
after that one has been ist processing

1777
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,120
which means rather fixed

1778
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,480
and this is the only comments we haven't

1779
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:03,040
addressed

1780
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:06,080
in the young doctor review and it's not

1781
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,400
technical so it's only about the young

1782
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,600
syntax and as mentioned earlier we also

1783
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,719
need to select

1784
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,120
select the prefix for the old internal

1785
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,639
model as well

1786
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,920
so okay so generally to

1787
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,520
open issues so far and

1788
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,719
but but we didn't those of these two

1789
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:29,120
issues are not technical so

1790
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,440
i'm wondering if we can request the

1791
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,679
working group last call if not blocking

1792
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,800
by the issues above

1793
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,520
that's it

1794
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,840
okay is there is there any question

1795
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:59,440
so uh for uh for the working group of

1796
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,040
las cola

1797
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,560
uh as as we said before now uh

1798
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,760
we we have uh uh

1799
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,960
we have drafts piling up we

1800
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,760
it's just a matter of defining defining

1801
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,120
priorities

1802
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,840
as we said before we have a sort of

1803
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,560
bottleneck

1804
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,760
in the young doctors

1805
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,760
uh area so we decided to

1806
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,719
prioritize the transport mbi

1807
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:32,080
applicability and

1808
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:36,239
the otn applicability beyond

1809
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,960
the 100 gigabits and this is sure one of

1810
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:39,679
the

1811
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,800
one of the next in in line because if

1812
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,679
you remember a while

1813
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:46,960
a while ago we said that uh uh the

1814
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,239
the the road map that we

1815
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:55,520
were trying to follow was uh topologies

1816
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,719
optical topologies or tn topologies

1817
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:01,360
and then and then the tunnels so this is

1818
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,280
more or less the

1819
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,480
uh the priority that we would like that

1820
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:09,360
we would like to follow

1821
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,760
okay well thanks note and yeah because

1822
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,239
i think the the generic tunnel also

1823
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:19,600
takes time

1824
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,239
so we can wait yes yes exactly

1825
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:26,590
thank you thank you

1826
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:29,899
[Music]

1827
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,719
the next one is the layer one service

1828
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:36,560
model

1829
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,120
who's the presenter is again nor is it

1830
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,599
no it's me

1831
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,879
oh okay please

1832
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,880
okay i will try to speed up okay

1833
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,960
uh this is about a one csm a meter

1834
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,560
boosie

1835
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,239
everyone you everyone

1836
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,159
okay next slide

1837
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,320
okay we had few changes since the last

1838
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,719
version and we addressed the uh

1839
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:09,199
the comments from top patch and

1840
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,400
basically we move

1841
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:12,880
clean up the model and we have moved the

1842
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:15,040
json example to appendix

1843
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:17,120
and we have created some issues related

1844
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,320
to the sls model

1845
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,560
tom raise good comments and we may need

1846
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:21,920
to review it

1847
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,320
and we are tracking all this issue and

1848
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,679
changes into uh

1849
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:28,840
into the github mentioned in the slide

1850
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,960
next

1851
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,480
one of the uh open point that we have to

1852
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,199
discuss

1853
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,760
is about the rules for um the the

1854
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,199
protocol coding function

1855
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:42,159
optical interface functions uh not all

1856
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:43,120
these three

1857
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,199
value not only possible not all the

1858
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,280
combinations of these three possible

1859
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,639
values are are allowed and mf63 has

1860
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,560
three tables that describe four tables

1861
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:53,679
that describe all the possible

1862
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,040
combination

1863
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,639
and the problem that we have is how do

1864
01:31:56,639 --> 01:31:59,280
we check that the combination that has

1865
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:00,400
been configured

1866
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,440
is valid and we have some discussion the

1867
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:05,199
previous meetings about uh

1868
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:07,199
leveraging other entities after some

1869
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,639
discussion with animal working group

1870
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:11,280
it looks like that was not possible and

1871
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:13,120
the mass painter is also not working

1872
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,800
because we have defined these

1873
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,159
three types as identities so maybe we

1874
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:19,199
need to discuss

1875
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,239
describe these checks in the document

1876
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:25,440
and not in younger i raised some

1877
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,159
questions

1878
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:28,960
a few days ago on networking group about

1879
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,520
where and how we can do this check

1880
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,679
and it looks like we can do this check

1881
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:35,120
before uh um

1882
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,800
a setting a configuration into the

1883
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,560
running data store that was at least the

1884
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,400
only comment i received

1885
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,360
so maybe we need to just describe this

1886
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,840
into the raft to make it clear that

1887
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,520
some checks has to be done on these

1888
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,040
three attributes

1889
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,320
uh which are not the cement which are

1890
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:53,679
not the c

1891
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:56,560
formally encoded into younger okay next

1892
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,159
slide

1893
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:00,159
this is a little bit about uh more

1894
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:01,679
details so what happens

1895
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,280
the client of writing is running at a

1896
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,880
store and and

1897
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,760
and and then the problem is there are

1898
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:08,000
two

1899
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,320
options the invalid configuration can be

1900
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,320
a set in the running data store

1901
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,360
but uh not applied to the operation at a

1902
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,000
store

1903
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,400
before the option uh the problem we have

1904
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:19,280
is that

1905
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,400
the client will never know why they are

1906
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,560
configured it has configure has not been

1907
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,679
applied

1908
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:30,080
so we may need to put some warning so

1909
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,040
some status

1910
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,120
in the document in the model to inform

1911
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,960
it the second option

1912
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:36,560
and this looks like possible from the

1913
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:38,400
feedback i received yesterday

1914
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,320
is that the valiant configuration is

1915
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,600
rejected

1916
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,560
and not asseted into the running data

1917
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,120
store

1918
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,760
so we need basically some back-end

1919
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:48,560
checks

1920
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,719
before the configuration coming from the

1921
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:51,679
client is

1922
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,719
written in run data store and then we we

1923
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,639
can have a protocol error message

1924
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,920
uh that replies to the client and one

1925
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,199
question is whether

1926
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,960
we want this protocol error message to

1927
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,520
be defined into the draft or leave it as

1928
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,600
implementation specific

1929
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,560
so any an opinion about whether we want

1930
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:11,360
to

1931
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:15,040
suggest the the error message

1932
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,440
or otherwise any implementation can do

1933
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,360
whatever it wants we need to describe

1934
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,120
what's happening in the reality when you

1935
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:24,000
implement to make sure that

1936
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,120
there is no incorrect configuration of

1937
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:30,000
these three attributes

1938
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,839
next slide

1939
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,159
so the next steps is basically to

1940
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,000
resolve the open issue that we have so

1941
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,320
one is about as i want to discuss

1942
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,639
how to what is the rules that we have to

1943
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:44,639
implement to make sure that

1944
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:45,840
the configuration of this three

1945
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:47,679
attribute is consistent

1946
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,040
then the there are some performance

1947
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,119
matrix which are defined in meth

1948
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,960
but we have also other documents which

1949
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,639
are defining performance metrics based

1950
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,400
on the itunes definition

1951
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,880
and and i think tom was right we need to

1952
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:01,760
a little bit

1953
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,320
aligned to the two the two definitions

1954
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,119
because

1955
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:07,119
uh maybe there should be no major

1956
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,280
differences in the semantic

1957
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,880
and then we noticed also the sll

1958
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,960
monitoring model is not fully aligned

1959
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,719
with the mf63 requirements and we need

1960
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:15,600
to do some

1961
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,920
updates in the document in the model

1962
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:18,880
itself

1963
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,880
and additional review and feedbacks from

1964
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,040
the working group are more than welcome

1965
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,560
to progress the work

1966
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:29,920
that's all any comment especially

1967
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,280
opinions on this

1968
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:36,719
on the validation of the 3.3 attributes

1969
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,199
are welcome thank you thank you can you

1970
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:42,080
share what is

1971
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,320
the your preferred solution your

1972
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,320
profession number four okay

1973
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:50,560
for for the processing rules yes

1974
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,040
um my preference is that you don't

1975
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:53,920
accept

1976
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,560
the configuration the running data store

1977
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,320
so it's a much cleaner for the client

1978
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:58,800
because

1979
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,440
it it sends a request to write the

1980
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:03,520
configuration it gets an error message

1981
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,400
back and i think it will also be nice to

1982
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:06,719
have

1983
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,440
some some as i don't know if

1984
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,159
standardized

1985
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,560
suggested the text to be put into the

1986
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,000
error message

1987
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,159
so we simplify it a bit the the

1988
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:17,520
interoperability

1989
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,600
because you know exactly what what is

1990
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:20,880
the problem that you

1991
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,840
that has caused the rejection of your

1992
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:25,760
configuration

1993
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,920
and for the error message i i'm open to

1994
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,920
suggestions i didn't think about yet

1995
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:30,719
about this

1996
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:35,840
text but yeah

1997
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:40,320
uh i i i think i

1998
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,520
uh i agree with you uh

1999
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,080
the more uh you know the mo the more

2000
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:46,639
freedom

2001
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:48,880
we live the less interoperability

2002
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,080
chances we have

2003
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,119
it's usually or better

2004
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:56,159
more work is needed by

2005
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:58,239
by system integrators to have a

2006
01:36:58,239 --> 01:36:59,600
different uh

2007
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:04,560
uh different vendors in the world

2008
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:07,920
so i mean that's a personal

2009
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,719
opinion obviously not not as jerk

2010
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:15,920
okay if is there anyone that would like

2011
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:18,239
to share opinions on this on these

2012
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:21,919
issues before we proceed them

2013
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,199
if not we will jump into the last

2014
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:32,960
presentation from ayurv on networks

2015
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,679
lasting

2016
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:45,199
okay can you hear me clearly really

2017
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:49,600
very well good um hi uh hi everyone this

2018
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:50,159
is uh

2019
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:52,159
hogwart from uh future week and i'm

2020
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:54,320
presenting this uh draft um

2021
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,960
or otr network slicing on behalf of uh

2022
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,600
all the cure authors and contributors

2023
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:03,840
next page

2024
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,960
so in this draft we introduce the

2025
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,560
concept of ojn slice controller which is

2026
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,719
can be deployed inside or outside of an

2027
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:14,080
sdn controller

2028
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:17,040
which has an interface to an sdn

2029
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:18,320
controller with the

2030
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,840
uh with the api at the mpi and

2031
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,199
um also interacts with an upper layer

2032
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,840
orchestrator or slice controller at the

2033
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:30,480
mbi

2034
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,239
and uh so there are a lot of discussions

2035
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:37,840
in the um no not yet yeah there are a

2036
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:38,880
lot of discussion

2037
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:42,239
uh can you go back to the last slide

2038
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,560
yeah so there are a lot of discussions

2039
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,320
uh in the teeth working group

2040
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,800
about the network slice definitions and

2041
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:49,760
uh

2042
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,520
um and uh the uh the

2043
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,040
workflows um and prior to this uh

2044
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,360
this meeting we have received a lot of

2045
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,760
helpful comments from

2046
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,400
interesting parties um in particular the

2047
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,119
relationship

2048
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:07,520
between the otn slice controller and an

2049
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:08,800
orchestrator

2050
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,080
or the ietf network

2051
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,520
site so there needs to be quite some

2052
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,040
alignment work

2053
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:20,719
and then to be done in the next step

2054
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:23,040
next

2055
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:28,719
okay so um this uh

2056
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:31,679
mod this truck is focusing on the uh otn

2057
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,960
slicer realization at the er at the mpi

2058
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:37,920
and uh there are two types of gen

2059
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,440
slicing that we are considering

2060
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:42,320
one is the connectivity-based uh in

2061
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:42,719
which

2062
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,639
a anode chain slice uh can be realized

2063
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:50,560
by us by its uh supporting

2064
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,360
by creating client services uh with

2065
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:59,040
odu switched to tunnels and for this one

2066
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:01,760
the existing models such as the network

2067
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,639
topology

2068
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:06,639
and uh t-tunnel model otm-k tunnel model

2069
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:09,840
plus the client signal model

2070
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,880
has already uh supported this use case

2071
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,880
and there's no need

2072
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,920
at least as we as far as we can see

2073
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:21,280
to extend it the second one

2074
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,679
is the is what we call resource based uh

2075
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:25,360
audience slicing which is

2076
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:28,880
uh to create audience slices by

2077
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:31,760
um uh reserving audio uh topological

2078
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:32,480
resources

2079
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:35,679
over an otn topology and this is the

2080
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:36,800
focus of the

2081
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,840
young model within this draft

2082
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,159
next

2083
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,840
um so some major updates since the last

2084
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,440
revision

2085
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:50,400
so we are very happy to have new authors

2086
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,760
joining us

2087
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:55,040
in particular victor from telefonica

2088
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:58,239
and there are also a lot of interest

2089
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:01,199
on this from from other parties and we

2090
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,159
will be adding

2091
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,560
more to this uh more coasters to this

2092
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,760
draft once

2093
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,199
it is agreed upon and also we

2094
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:12,480
updated uh use case descriptions uh

2095
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:15,040
based on the feedback uh from the from

2096
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,840
the uh

2097
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:21,119
co-authors and um

2098
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:24,560
we added a young model for the otnsc

2099
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:27,600
mpi with

2100
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,000
the goal of realizing an opinion slice

2101
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,719
using

2102
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:34,000
resource coloring over a t topology and

2103
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,199
that coloring could be link based

2104
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:41,440
or otf odu time slot based

2105
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,759
next

2106
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:47,760
so this is the initial model of the

2107
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,800
blue chain slicing at the api and as you

2108
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,679
can see

2109
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:54,239
it is augmenting the topology model by

2110
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:57,679
adding a slice identifier to

2111
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,119
to the to the t link and uh

2112
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:04,239
and it specifies whether this slice is

2113
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:07,600
um is uh uh

2114
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,159
link based which is which means uh the

2115
01:42:10,159 --> 01:42:10,880
entire

2116
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,400
uh t link is assigned it to a slice

2117
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:18,159
or it could be an otn

2118
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:22,800
time slot based yeah and

2119
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,520
there's one thing to note is a previous

2120
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,360
version of this model

2121
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,480
was also contributed to the oep open

2122
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,520
source project

2123
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:34,639
and has been published within its

2124
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:39,679
last release next

2125
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:43,760
so here are the next steps um so we

2126
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,800
are also looking into adding

2127
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,080
a young data model for the otnsc

2128
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:54,000
mpi and again as

2129
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
there is alignment work needs to be done

2130
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,119
for the itf network slicing

2131
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:01,360
and the ongoing discussions within the

2132
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,880
keys working group

2133
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,000
we will put it as a second step

2134
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,159
uh and also we will be looking into the

2135
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:13,280
uh slicing for uh external links

2136
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,320
which which is the uh both

2137
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:20,159
the access link for the otr network

2138
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:22,320
and also inter domain when we're dealing

2139
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,199
with multi

2140
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:25,679
uh when we are dealing with the

2141
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:26,880
interoperability at

2142
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,320
the between multiple audio layers

2143
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:33,679
um audio uh domains and

2144
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:36,400
uh the third one is we will be aligning

2145
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,400
this definition

2146
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,520
with the discussion in the teeth working

2147
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,400
group

2148
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:47,040
and we're likely to address that

2149
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,159
with probably a new use case that and

2150
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,520
again slicing is

2151
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,880
a realization of ietf network slice and

2152
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,520
an ogn slice controller is a subordinate

2153
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:06,239
of from the control perspective

2154
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:08,800
also we'll be uh addressing comments and

2155
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,159
reviews from the working group

2156
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:14,159
and also co-authors and reviewers

2157
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,960
and the last thing is to socialize and

2158
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,320
um

2159
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,719
invite more coasters before we uh try to

2160
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:27,040
uh ask for a working group adoption

2161
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:30,320
so uh next

2162
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,199
right oh so yeah this is just one

2163
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:34,960
additional slice that we wanted to show

2164
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,080
the uh the discussion about

2165
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:40,639
the relationship between otn slicing and

2166
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,560
uh itf network slice

2167
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,360
on the left you will see this is what we

2168
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:45,760
are

2169
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:48,800
the current use cases in which the ogn

2170
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,119
slice request is coming from

2171
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:54,239
the client which is carried

2172
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,880
all the way down to the to the otn slice

2173
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,239
controller with otn specific

2174
01:45:00,239 --> 01:45:04,480
information whereas on the right

2175
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,960
the ogn slice is just part of

2176
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,000
realization of

2177
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,040
ietf network slice and

2178
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:15,040
the network slice controller

2179
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,719
uh initiate an ogen slice request uh to

2180
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:21,040
its to a subordinate or gen slice

2181
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:22,080
controller

2182
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,639
um but no matter whether it's the left

2183
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:25,280
or the right

2184
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:28,560
uh the interface uh used by an ogn slice

2185
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,080
controller is always the same

2186
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:35,280
yeah but this um

2187
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,760
this scenario we need to be more uh

2188
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,360
clarified

2189
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,560
in the following discussions and i hope

2190
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,199
to hear

2191
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:46,480
more feedback from uh from

2192
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:49,760
from the uh interesting parties on that

2193
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,199
you know i think that's it and

2194
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:59,839
comments are more than welcome

2195
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,400
i i will start so i i think the draft

2196
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,320
very good progresses and i really

2197
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,639
appreciated the

2198
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:12,000
um the alignment with other work

2199
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,360
in other working groups and the

2200
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:19,360
work being been done in teas

2201
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,719
being one one of them uh i

2202
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:26,400
i had a question regarding uh

2203
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,639
the scope why what does it cover just at

2204
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:30,159
the mpi

2205
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:33,280
uh and not

2206
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,320
the dcmi in the sense that

2207
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:40,159
how can the orchestrator or the

2208
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:42,730
nato slice controller

2209
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:44,320
[Music]

2210
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:48,800
decide to create a new tiana's lice

2211
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,000
upon a generic request

2212
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,920
on top is is a simply optoscope and will

2213
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,639
be managed

2214
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,679
somewhere else or it is assumed

2215
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:02,960
that the generic request for

2216
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:08,320
i don't know uh 10 gigabit of bandwidth

2217
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:11,040
can be accommodated by the orchestrator

2218
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,440
or the netherslice controller deciding

2219
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,520
autonomously whether to use an otna

2220
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,159
slice

2221
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:19,199
or a different slice

2222
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:24,080
yeah as indicated that we're covering

2223
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:24,639
the

2224
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:28,080
uh routine slicing at the mpi is just

2225
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,280
first step and the the um

2226
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:34,159
uh the utm slicing for the mbi will also

2227
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:34,719
be

2228
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:38,960
included in perhaps the next revision

2229
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:41,920
okay okay

2230
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:47,360
maybe you can you can say that it's

2231
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:50,480
the scope of step step one

2232
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:53,760
and then eventually we'll cover also the

2233
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,480
cmi

2234
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:57,679
just just to avoid the

2235
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:01,760
the the same question to be to be

2236
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,840
to be raised by the reader

2237
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,119
thanks yeah well do

2238
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:12,960
so does anyone have

2239
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:19,040
other questions

2240
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:22,320
if not

2241
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,679
i think we can

2242
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,960
we can close this section

2243
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,880
uh thank you everyone for the

2244
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,320
