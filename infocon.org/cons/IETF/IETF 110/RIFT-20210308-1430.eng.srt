61
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,960
thing

62
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
that talks about jupiter implementation

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,479
open source and deals with a lot of you

64
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,440
know

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,280
the magic of the real implementations

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,199
coming up and what the stuff looks like

67
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,560
and further considerations when you

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,639
build the fabric and so on and so on

69
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,759
so use it or lose it actually you won't

70
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,000
lose

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
it it's out there for free okay next one

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,479
please

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
uh all right so alvaro is giving us a

74
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,400
very

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
nice review um uh he's slogging through

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
the whole thing thanks so much

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,919
most appreciated he's learning you know

78
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,680
crash learning thrift on the on

79
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,800
as well on the go and we started weekly

80
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
meetings

81
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
um to basically work through the

82
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
comments and

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
polish the document until uh we

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
hopefully get him happy

85
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,320
and move to the next step so first big

86
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,479
thing is that the document will go svg

87
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,199
so that

88
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
seems to work so we are in a sense

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
um a little bit of a guinea pig

90
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
because we're probably one of the first

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
but given how complex a lot of the

92
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,720
figures are

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
in the respect it makes sense so jordan

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,560
uh volunteered to add a lot of these

95
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,759
complex figures

96
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,039
um in svg and

97
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,360
we already have fsn as we do pictures

98
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,320
and so on

99
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
uh jeff can you kill the mic sideways

100
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,800
noise

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
um and uh

102
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,639
the bigger things that came out from the

103
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,000
first meeting that we had there and some

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
discussion was that

105
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,639
uh we need to refactor the intro section

106
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
this really suffered from a lot of

107
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,080
previous comments where we

108
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
remove things like requirement section

109
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,319
and so on so we refactor that stuff into

110
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,600
an intro

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
and it will need the reader's guide to

112
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,240
understand for reader depending on his

113
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,600
interest what kind of fabric he's

114
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,960
building and how

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,880
and how much he wants to implement over

116
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,000
if which parts need to be read and

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
how they build up on each other

118
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,520
um some mild moving of sections will be

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
necessary

120
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,280
and lots of forward referencing to model

121
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,080
so on

122
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
alvaro's radio it became clear that we

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,759
basically have this model as appendix at

124
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,880
the end that we

125
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,840
kind of assume that somebody knows what

126
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
the model is

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
and we don't forward reference enough

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,039
when we describe the protocol and how it

129
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:43,600
works

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
and then of course a lot of needs and i

131
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,960
think that's it

132
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,000
so that's where we stand

133
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:03,840
any questions

134
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,919
all right smooth sailing then yep

135
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,400
now we are moving to the applicability

136
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479

137
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,560

uh of the next step of the working group

209
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,440
last call

210
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,199

212
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
thank you thank you sandy so with

213
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,959
regards to addressing comments from

214
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,480
reviews

215
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,639
in general uh people who provided

216
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,560
commands don't track

217
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,600
they don't participate necessarily in

218
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,480
routing

219
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000
area so if you could reach

220
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,760
out to all the people who provide their

221
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
comment and ask their view

222
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,199
on your updates whether you address

223
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,040
their comments whether they're happy

224
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,399
that would be the right thing to do

225
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,560
just reach out to everyone who provides

226
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,720
their comments and ask for the guidance

227
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
on the updated draft

228
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,519
uh do you mean that i need to

229
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,440
uh to get the response

230
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,720
from those commenters right yeah you you

231
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,440
want to

232
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,320
know that your comments have addressed

233
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,680
their questions

234
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,519
because practically it's stateless from

235
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,720
their perspective they're not tracking

236
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
what you're doing unless you tell them

237
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
okay i see

238
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,519
so next step for you would be reach out

239
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,480
and

240
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,000
ask for final comments where they're

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,320
happy with how you address them

242
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,240
usually there are some iterations it's

243
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
an iterative process to

244
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,279
you know to update document

245
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,240
and obviously we would like to finalize

246
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
last call as soon as possible so

247
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,480
please do so and we would love to

248
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,079

270
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,720
according to the implementation

271
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,359
experience and the young rules

272
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,319
shifo gives many suggestions about the

273
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,839

thanks to shifon very much too next

275
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,120

overview of the model the model is

278
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,160
defined

279
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
according to drift protocol draft

280
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,039
the model includes protocol

281
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,400
configuration

282
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,440

283
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,400
some features

284
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
are edited to enhance the protocol

285
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,240
and except for the co-author we also

286

as we can see multiple ripped instances

292
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,440
are supported and there's writeable data

293

329
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360

330
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,840
that's all thanks any comments

331
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,520
a few comments from my side thank you

332
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,200
sandy uh

333
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,400
tony do you feel there's a need to wait

334
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,440
for version 13

335
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,640
to accommodate changes

336
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,159
um no i don't think alvaro's

337
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,080
comments were uh

338
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,480
will be changing the model or have any

339
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,720
you know fundamental

340
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,280
mechanism or anything like that no i

341
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,559
don't think so

342
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,640
i still have to review this last version

343
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,760
of the anchor for it

344
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,760
okay so next step here is going to be

345
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
sending requests for review to young

346
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
doctors and if young doctors are happy

347
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,960
we can definitely proceed to working

348
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,280
group last call

349
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
okay thanks thank you uh one more

350
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,039
um so it's uh correct to assume that

351
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,080
this work nicely

352
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,039
together with the known implementations

353
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,159
for example

354
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,679
bruno's open source implementation and

355
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
perhaps gte's implementation

356
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,159
and it's a it's produced by

357
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,919
bruno's implementations the

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,039
experience and some of our

359
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,159
product implementation experience

360
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,559
yeah yeah and i already reviewed an

361
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,400
early version i gave a lot of comments

362
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
it looked okay but

363
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
like i say i did not review the very

364
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,840
latest version i will put it on my

365
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
endless to-do list here to do it pretty

366
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
soon

367
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,880
okay tony can review it

368
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,679
again it's great yeah i will do it

369
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,760
because it's important for me as well so

370
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,120
you know at the end we don't end up with

371
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,039
the end model which is wonderful but

372
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,200
you know implementations don't comply to

373
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,480
it or properly support it

374
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
if bruno reviewed it the ct reviewed it

375
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,000
i reviewed it i think we'll have

376
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,880
something pretty good

377
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,760
on the table here that would be really

378
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
great have implementation report on this

379
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,919
if we have working implementation that's

380
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,039
great addition to working document yeah

381
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,720
i agree yes some kind of implementation

382
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
experience would be good i i wasn't

383
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,440
aware that brutal was implementing

384
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
anything on the yank stuff i know that

385
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,679
you looked at

386
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,120
the model over but wasn't the word there

387
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,639
was any implementation or going on

388
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,200
okay thank you okay thanks everyone

389
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,520
and next presentation is swiftkey value

390
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,840
registry by jordan

391
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
all right thanks everyone uh so my name

392
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
is jordan head i'm just here to present

393
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:46,640
the

394
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,159
rift key value registry uh the

395
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,440
actual kb details are defined in the

396
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,159
main spec

397
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,080
but this further details a lot of the

398
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,600
details pertaining to uh

399
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
like structure and key types and how

400
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,799
those are maintained

401
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,520
next slide please

402
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,960
so just a bit of a primer for those

403
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,919
underwear

404
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,520
haven't looked at in a while basically

405
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,440
kv's ties are used to disseminate

406
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
information to other riff nodes

407
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,280
um you know pulling this little quote

408
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,559
straight from the draft rate the data

409
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,480
contained within these kv ties can be

410
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,360
used for

411
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,320
any imaginable purpose so uh it's we

412
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,840
give you just enough rope

413
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
um cavity ties are flooded north or

414
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
south

415
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,000
and they're tie broken based on uh

416
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,039
highest level and then

417
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,159
you know highest system id that's

418
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,039
required by

419
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,679
cell flooding but north flooding while

420
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,760
it should

421
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
adhere to that doesn't have to uh

422
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,320
as far as use cases we can jump into the

423
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,320
next slide please

424
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,880
so i'll leave it for the respective

425
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
presenters today to kind of elaborate on

426
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,080
their specifics

427
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,960
but uh as far as you know current use

428
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,720
cases so auto evpn is

429
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,400
you know one thing we're looking at is

430
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
basically leveraging kvs for

431
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
necessary operational information you

432
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
know relationship between the overlay

433
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,240
and the underlay for state

434
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,200
um srift is actually using it for you

435
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,799
know disseminating the

436
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,159
uh like srgb system id sort of details

437
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,159
uh to facilitate forwarding for sr um

438
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,039
and then finally you know while there's

439
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,400
no mention of it currently and

440
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,159
in the multicaster of implementation you

441
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,000
know it's that there i think there are

442
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
some considerations for doing so

443
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,760
but that's something for a little bit

444
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,440
more discussion

445
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,159
um and lastly it's not listed on here

446
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,000
but the draft itself does make some

447
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,279
considerations for

448
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,600
like ipmaq binding and security rollover

449
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
considerations for uh like the

450
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,640
security model um if we can jump to the

451
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,440
next slide

452
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,960
kind of get into the format what it

453
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,360
looks like

454
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
uh so basically this is a high level

455
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,000
overview

456
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,880
the first we have one byte that

457
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,840
signifies

458
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
whether the key itself is well known

459
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:05,919
which

460
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,760
kind of as the nomenclature signifies

461
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,200
that it would be something that

462
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
implementations you know should support

463
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,320
um

464
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,720
it can also signify oui which is

465
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
basically just

466
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,880
uh vendor specific or company specific

467
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,440
uh and they use their previously signed

468
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,400
ui space

469
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,840
and finally there's an experimental

470
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
identifier as well for any other you

471
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,279
know use cases

472
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,360
uh the three bytes for key identifier

473
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,400
itself

474
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,600
describe the you know the structure uh

475
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
and you know the specific elements

476
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,799
within the values field

477
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,159
uh so it's and then

478
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,559
um kind of finally it's just it's the

479
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,679
data itself

480
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,840
uh and if you jump to the next slide

481
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,000
there's a you know

482
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
30 000 foot view example of what we can

483
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,279
do so

484
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
um if we were just for the sake of

485
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,200
example looking at a well-known you know

486
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,279
tie or kv it can contain any data or

487
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,880
data structure you know it's not limited

488
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,720
to strings or integers we could even

489
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
put another first encoded data model in

490
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,400
there if we wanted to

491
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,039
um but but again it's you know your

492
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,200
miles may vary you can

493
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
do whatever you need to with it um i

494
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,480
guess

495
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,520
next steps would be you know

496
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,360
co-authorship and comments are welcome

497
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,039
uh feel free and then you know we can

498
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,600
pursue

499
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
last call after after some feedback

500
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,039
and last slide if there are any

501
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,120
questions i can try and address them now

502
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,440
or

503
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,039
we can follow up offline

504
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,840
i have a question on the last slide

505
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,760
so that example one there is that a key

506
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,080
id

507
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,799
yeah that would be the key identifier

508
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,240
itself yes

509
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,039
um is it that the key identifier itself

510
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,840
includes a

511
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,120
post a type or an id or

512
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,080
because for example if we want to um

513
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,679
encode some uh

514
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,200
segment routing information i assume um

515
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,520
then we would have a specific type for

516
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,919
that and then the key id

517
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,600
i assume the well-known is um it's

518
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,880
it's not exactly a key type it's uh

519
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
mainly it's a property of a type or

520
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,000
what we get there is a registry and you

521
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,520
just get the one and the two and the

522
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,320
three and the four

523
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,559
and that's it and if that would be no

524
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,240
the key needs for a differentiation

525
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,000
that's already part of your data

526
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,159
so you say it's something but for this

527
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,159
node well the node becomes part of the

528
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,559
data

529
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,679
i do not think we should start to

530
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,039
structure the key

531
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,640
any further but it's a good discussion

532
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,679
so you're saying the key i key id is

533
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,559
part of the value

534
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,559
um no it's not

535
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,120
no it's not it defines what you talk

536
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,679
about

537
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,200
but then the thing itself is in the data

538
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,919
right and look if you for example go i'm

539
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,960
unhappy with that

540
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,760
then you have you know one byte in front

541
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,080
so

542
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,679
beside the well-known we can have

543
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,520
something like segment routing purposes

544
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,799
and you just take a value

545
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,240
and then you run and you do behind

546
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,159
whatever you want but you still have to

547
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,320
keep to the structure key and value

548
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
because we need tie breaking right if

549
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
the same key id comes from multiple

550
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,039
places

551
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,080
okay well i guess when

552
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,200
it comes to the sr specific one we

553
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,399
can have more context of total

554
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,720
right you just grab a lot of well-known

555
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
it's a huge space or otherwise you just

556
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,200
say oh i want

557
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
something that is just sr and you take

558
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,360
the first bite you take the value out of

559
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,720
the registry both are independent

560
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,640
registers

561
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
okay okay thanks oh

562
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:59,840
i'll i'll defer the to the later yeah

563
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,279
any more questions

564
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,159
okay let's move on the next presentation

565
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,840
is i think jordan i think

566
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,200
he is second routine for drift and

567
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,159
jeffrey is to present okay

568
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,240
all right so this is a segment routing

569
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
with uh ripped

570
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,640
um we have co-authored myself jeff

571
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,600
jordan had who joined recently and don

572
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,240
paddak

573
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,440
from time some time ago um next slide

574
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,840
please

575
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,039
the segment writing draft was actually

576
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,640
published uh

577
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,120
some time ago we never really talked

578
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,159
about it much

579
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,200
it was not presented before so this is

580
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,840
the first time we probably presented

581
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,799
here

582
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:59,760
um so let me first start with the

583
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,520
comparison with ospf

584
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,640
uh or bgp based segment routing

585
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,640
um typically uh

586
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,600
each router is provisioned with srgb

587
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,159
information and the city information

588
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,520
and then those information is flooded

589
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,559
throughout the sr domain um

590
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,679
notice that the provisioning is done

591
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,440
on each router um based on centralized

592
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,080
planning

593
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,120
even in the old days before sros

594
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,080
ling came to life the all the

595
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,679
provisioning is on

596
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,000
centrally maybe in the head of an

597
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
operator and then

598
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
and the planning result is then

599
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
carried to uh maybe on pen paper pen and

600
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,279
paper and then

601
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,679
entered into the individual routers and

602
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,559
from there

603
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,799
the provisioning information is flooded

604
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,000
out

605
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,039
um nowadays of course yeah

606
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,440
you can use netconf young or other

607
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,720
means to um to send the

608
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,799
centralized centrally planned

609
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,840
information to uh to the routers

610
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,320
and the routers then flood the advertise

611
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,799
the information

612
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,399
next slide please

613
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,360
now uh about traffic forwarding um there

614
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,279
are two ways of uh doing

615
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,000
sr forwarding the first simple one is

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,720
you afford traffic based on the igp or

617
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,799
bgp routing just use a

618
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,240
prefix set that is basically replacing

619
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
ldp

620
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,440
with igp or bgp based label distribution

621
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,559
nothing special there the next one is

622
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,519
you do actual traffic steering based on

623
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,720
the seat list in the pic

624
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,000
in the package and then

625
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,279
when each node will route the packet to

626
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,320
the segments

627
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,960
represented by the top seat once the

628
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,120
packet gets to that segment

629
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,159
then that the top side is popped

630
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,559
and then continue to route to the next

631
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
segment in the list

632
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,279
now that when the ingress router

633
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,440
it needs to uh needs to put the cities

634
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,120
into the package it can be

635
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,919
that to determine what to be put into

636
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:20,880
the uh

637
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,640
package it can be either done by base uh

638
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,919
by a local calculation or based on the

639
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,320
sr policy

640
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,240
programs from the sr controllers

641
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,039
next slide please

642
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
now compared to rips how this is done

643
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
the srgb and seed distribution how

644
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,760
it is done we now do not

645
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,640
provision those uh srgb or acid

646
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,919
information on

647
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,519
the non-tough notes and there will be no

648
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
flooding from those either

649
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,080
instead the result of central uh

650
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,200
planning

651
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,039
is flooded south uh using the uh kiwi

652
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,320
mechanism

653
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,320
by the tough notes of course the top

654
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
notes need to learn all those uh

655
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,360
provision information from the

656
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,000
oxidation um oxidator

657
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
so this actually combines a two-step

658
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,399
process in the igp or bgp

659
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,600
case into a single step and that

660
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
perfectly matching the

661
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,360
gtp principle of the the rift

662
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,080
next slide please

663
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,399
so about traffic forwarding we here we

664
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,320
only care about the traffic steering

665
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,080
based on the city list

666
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,919
um in other words a labor stack um

667
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,159
in particular srv6 is not in scope for

668
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,320
now um

669
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,320
and then when it comes to the how to

670
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,000
determine the seed list

671
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,640
we will only rely on sr policies

672
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,919
programmed by the controllers

673
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,079
and then um when we

674
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,760
um do not have parallel links

675
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,199
uh or multiple planar tech topologies

676
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,159
um that the leaves only have northbound

677
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,359
default routes

678
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,839
so they cannot determine the seedless

679
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,520
that's that's why we rely on the

680
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,879
sr policy from the controllers and we

681
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,000
only need to care about note 6

682
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,760
because when you have no parallel links

683
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,000
then no set is all you need

684
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,719
besides that we don't see benefits

685
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,560
for prefixes that are not for nodes

686
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,079
um now if you do have parallel links

687
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,960
or if you do have multiplanar uh

688
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,320
topologies

689
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,520
then we need to uh have adjacency to

690
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,800
choose the right link

691
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,400
or right plan and for that

692
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,920
we can we can use sr

693
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,040
or lb local base

694
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,839
for for the sr for the saves um

695
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,800
we have some outstanding discussion on

696
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,079
how that can be done

697
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,560
um um this will be addressed in in a

698
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,839
future revision

699
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,359
um there is one issue we would like to

700
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,200
call out here

701
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,160
reef protocol itself does not require

702
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,599
loopback addresses

703
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,359
in principle now notice that

704
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,000
sr traffic steering is based on routing

705
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,400
to node segments in the seedlist

706
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,800
so we must have individual routes to

707
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,760
those nodes

708
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,440
in the seedless now

709
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,560
for those individual routes it will be

710
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,200
easier to have the routes based on loop

711
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,400
addresses whether it's ipv4 ipv6

712
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,400
instead of based on the system ids

713
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
[Music]

714
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,359
you could do system id it's just that

715
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,320
now you have a different table for those

716
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,640
routes based on system ids

717
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
and also consider that operator

718
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
may want to do managements

719
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
using those using loopback addresses

720
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,720
anyway

721
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
so if you put all those considerations

722
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,839
together

723
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,800
um one question is should we simply

724
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
require loopback addresses

725
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,320
that's one that's one question we want

726
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
to bring to the to the group

727
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,599
of discussion um as mentioned in this

728
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,760
last slide adjacency will also be

729
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,960
addressed in the upcoming

730
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,000
of the upcoming version

731
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,760
next slide um

732
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,640
so we use qb to distribute

733
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,079
sr information here um

734
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,960
so we have two boxes here the first one

735
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,680
is that

736
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,880
uh we need a key type

737
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,760
uh to describe that this is uh for sr

738
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,040
purpose

739
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,320
and then and and then

740
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
we have the next box is for the specific

741
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,040
ssr information

742
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,359
um

743
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,839
we uh here we need to uh

744
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,760
identify the system id slash loopback

745
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
address basically specify

746
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,440
which node this is for and

747
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,640
and there we have the label base

748
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,760
label range and no note say and

749
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,560
potentially other information in the

750
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,079
future

751
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,440
especially for how we advertise

752
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,800
adjacency information here

753
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,760
so so going back to the my earlier

754
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,119
question about kiwi

755
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,920
registry here um

756
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,160
you can see that there is a system id

757
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
slash new pack address

758
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,440
to identify which notice is for so

759
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,560
that is sort of like a key

760
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,920
identifier to me and

761
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,160
what's the relationship with uh uh of

762
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
that information

763
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,119
and the uh s-rift note here and what is

764
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:33,760
gb

765
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,359
tbd2 um

766
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,880
versus tbd so that's the

767
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,960
that's the ties back to the question i

768
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,839
had earlier

769
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,400
um next slide please

770
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,240
so obviously we see comments and we

771
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,480
we will address the outstanding issues

772
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,240
and after

773
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,839
er or we will settle those uh

774
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,320
outstanding issues and revise the drafts

775
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,440
uh

776
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,599
that time we will see uh seek working

777
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,400
group adoption

778
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,880
any questions to jeffrey

779
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,680
yeah so i stand accused of not having uh

780
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,119
tony juniper

781
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,000
i stand accused of not having read the

782
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,079
newest version but my observation is

783
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,760
that you start to define those things

784
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,440
and what you suggest will work fine in

785
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,800
principle

786
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,200
make sure that you keep very precise

787
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,520
account what is northbound and what is

788
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,400
south about

789
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,560
in terms of key values that you want to

790
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,720
redistribute because first

791
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,320
mechanisms are different right time

792
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,920
breaking and

793
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,680
second it has all implications on

794
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,839
scalability of the solution

795
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,200
um i got a your comment about

796
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,119
making clear is north or southbound

797
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,079
what's the second one

798
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,720
yeah nothing what you suggest in

799
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,760
principle as the

800
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,599
key value the way you want to distribute

801
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,200
it will work just fine yes

802
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,280
and the system id and the loopback well

803
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,040
that's kind of implementation specific

804
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,920
loopbacks are

805
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,400
relatively trivial to get around in rift

806
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,960
so why not but then you impose

807
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,040
addressing on the whole scheme

808
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,240
so beware what you wish for because if

809
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,400
you work of system idea that full gtp

810
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,079
if you start to talk about loopbacks

811
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,599
then you better describe how to

812
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,680
automatically derive lupex from system

813
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,880
ids

814
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,839
which theoretically can be done or you

815
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,000
are bound along the thought end to force

816
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,760
people to address loopbacks

817
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,680
on the fabric rather than heavy gtp

818
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,720
yeah um so um

819
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,480
um one really question is that's um

820
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,760
in a rift network when you do not use

821
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,720
new back address how do you normally

822
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,920
manage the

823
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,000
nodes or you well how do you

824
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,160
ssh into an ethernet switch you don't

825
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,040
so if the stiff stuff works well enough

826
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,240
white butter

827
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,760
and if you need too well then you need

828
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,480
lubricants yes

829
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,079
yeah i think there's larger picture if

830
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,240
you are planning on traffic engineering

831
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,200
and you know to do explicit stuff

832
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
probably you would want to be able

833
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,839
to address the nut specifically so it's

834
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,040
not the cattle anymore

835
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,240
for pets but

836
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,839
practically tony to your comment about

837
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,599
scalability if you look at

838
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,640
non-rift network the process of

839
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,480
provisioning is orthogonal to

840
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,640
process of discovery so you would go to

841
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,800
your orchestration system and provisions

842
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,599
rgbs

843
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,520
seeds ikea or something else and then

844
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,800
you would use

845
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,599
a dynamic part of network to actually do

846
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,520
out the discovery

847
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
bgp lasted up to the controller and

848
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,160
reporters rgbs and csus

849
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,920
here you already know what they are so

850
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,720
there's no process of auto discovery

851
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,200
everything had been discovered before i

852
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,640
mean you don't need to discover

853
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,359
so it addresses much higher skills

854
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,280
tommy's tommy is raising his enzo but uh

855
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,040
yeah bigger discussion maybe list but

856
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,680
arguably you could build the full sr

857
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,400
thing

858
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,720
fully gtp if you have system id you

859
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,079
could derive all these blocks and

860
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,599
everything and just distribute them

861
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,720
and you don't need to configure

862
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,319
everything but i think this is to lock

863
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,040
for the mic now

864
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,280
okay yeah thank you yeah i mean

865
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,040
non-planar topologies

866
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
and with single links absolutely there's

867
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,800
nothing you just need to

868
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,440
to reach next node in more complex

869
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,800
topologies probably

870
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,359
something more would be needed but this

871
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,119
is something that should definitely be

872
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,720
addressed in the draft

873
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,598
for implementers

874
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:12,079
okay

875
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,280
thank you jeffrey tony again

876
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,560
you have people raising hands

877
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,359
are there more questions

878
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,480
i wanted to make some observations um

879
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,240
more than anything

880
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,879
like this

881
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,000
go ahead basically i suppose

882
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,160
it's breaking up that's not very useful

883
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,480
i'll save it for the mailing list

884
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,880
thank you tony

885
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,760
okay so now for something completely

886
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,359
different

887
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,280
which is probably unsurprising when i'm

888
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,400
showing stuff

889
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,599
so this is actually someone's else idea

890
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,800
um which i hope to flesh out and there's

891
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,920
a bunch of other people

892
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,920
who contributed a lot because it's

893
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,760
pulling a couple of technologies

894
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,200
together so it's

895
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,920
lots of jordan's work wentz of course

896
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,240
and

897
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,079
i kind of fleshed out the rift part

898
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,000
based on somebody's house idea

899
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,359
and uh we call it autoevpn

900
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,440
and i show in the next slide the

901
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,280
motivation and what the hell are we up

902
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:35,760
to

903
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,960
next one please right so

904
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,760
uh first i say i mean what are we doing

905
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,359
right what are the drivers and what is

906
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,720
the vision what you're trying to achieve

907
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,680
then i show you

908
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,599
the architecture of the whole thing and

909
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,359
flash a bunch of first details to give

910
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,960
you a taste

911
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,640
taste what's coming and then you know

912
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,240
next steps you know the work

913
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,959
next one please

914
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,200
right so put on your reading glasses so

915
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,760
what's the drivers and vision right so

916
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,800
if you watch auto evpn right

917
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,920
then it's a technology that claims to

918
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,040
replace

919
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,040
um l2 as a technology

920
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,920
now ethernet l2 is famous for the fact

921
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,560
that

922
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
it its configuration consists of

923
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,319
literally no configuration at all

924
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,839
right so you just plug in ethernet

925
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,520
switches and guess what they work right

926
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,839
stp no one even knows what stp is why

927
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,119
should they

928
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,079
so uh when you now start to deploy edp

929
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,079
and sl2

930
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,040
uh you start to deal with the fact that

931
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,800
it needs quite significant amount of

932
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,839
configuration

933
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,240
so you either take a magic controller i

934
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,920
mean nothing wrong with that

935
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,040
it does it's it's you know its own

936
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,240
uh beauty and in larger deployments that

937
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,319
may be absolutely you know

938
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,240
a better solution right because evpn

939
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
skills way bigger than l2

940
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,000
could right and it was one of the

941
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,640
undoings of l2 um

942
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,000
and then you face your own set of

943
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,839
problems right so how does the

944
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,760
controller find the boxes and how does

945
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,520
it know which box is actually what in

946
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,920
the whole edp topology and so on and so

947
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,640
on

948
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,760
or alternately right you go in manually

949
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,200
and a lot of people do that you go and

950
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,680
configure your l3 ip underlay first you

951
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,200
build the fabric and we're talking

952
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,200
always evpn on the fabrics which is you

953
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,599
know

954
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,280
where it's being i would say prominently

955
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:25,920
used

956
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,319
if not actually used in most of the

957
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,040
cases

958
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,440
so you configure l3 ip on delay which

959
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,359
means you go and address a lot of stuff

960
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,760
all the links and with the v6

961
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,800
link local and forwarding of a v6 and v4

962
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,400
you have a little bit less work because

963
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,560
v6 does no pretty good work of the whole

964
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,280
thing

965
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,280
and then you go and provision your

966
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,640
underlay protocol

967
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,520
um unless you run rift right so you have

968
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,680
to give ivs and you have to configure

969
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,839
the peers and igps are a little bit

970
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,200
better about that

971
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,160
and bgp has some special hacks where it

972
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,839
tries to lessen the load and you start

973
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,119
to configure vfd

974
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,960
and try to bring you on the layout and

975
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,880
then you go and debunk it and then you

976
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,200
start to configure the l3ip overlay to

977
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,599
give

978
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,720
to get you evpn so you bring up your rrs

979
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,560
where you need them which needs cluster

980
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,079
ids and loopbacks

981
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,680
and then you start to bring up the

982
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,520
leaves right which actually

983
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,760
have the c interfaces only then you need

984
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,680
again cluster ids and loopbacks and

985
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,280
loopbacks for vxlan

986
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,040
we're talking ep and dx land because

987
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,359
this is the most prevalent case

988
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,839
uh today by far and then you need some

989
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:30,480
loop expo

990
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,800
rb's and raw distinguishes four type two

991
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,920
type fives and routers vlans vnis and

992
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,559
you know

993
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,880
i probably forgot a bunch of more things

994
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,160
and then you go and debug the whole

995
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,200
thing

996
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,720
so can we have the l2 simplicity back

997
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,960
for edpn and that's the driver that's

998
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,559
the question we ask

999
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,599
and we think that with rift we can the

1000
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,119
next one so what is the architecture of

1001
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,440
such a beast

1002
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,720
next one please okay so

1003
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,040
it changes a couple of key observations

1004
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:01,760
um

1005
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,960
which are unique to rift so far

1006
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,559
and uh first you ip underlay the salt

1007
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,559
right unless you really want to ssh into

1008
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,000
the nodes and you know

1009
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,920
you will possibly want sr and other

1010
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,599
frills and things but if you just want

1011
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,480
basic ip

1012
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,160
in any flavor v4 v6 v4 over v6 both

1013
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,240
stuff just magically comes up zero

1014
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,400
config well you have to fix the top of

1015
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,880
the fabric right because

1016
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,960
the protocol doesn't have gps so it

1017
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,559
doesn't know what is up and what is down

1018
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,240
and that arguably has nothing to do with

1019
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,319
geographic location either right so only

1020
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,000
humans understand what is the top of the

1021
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,880
fabric

1022
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,480
so you fix this you know whatever you

1023
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,319
have this couple of top of fabric and

1024
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,000
you're pretty much done you have the ip

1025
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,119
underlay

1026
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,839
and then you start to observe the drift

1027
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,119
actually has enough topology

1028
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,000
understanding because

1029
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,960
that stands a direction to figure out

1030
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,119
where to put the rrs into the fabric for

1031
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,200
edpn and what are the leads

1032
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,400
that will be running the ce

1033
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,559
and then you start to realize that every

1034
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,480
node actually has enough information to

1035
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,760
run

1036
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,440
all the elections and computation of

1037
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,880
necessary values to

1038
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,040
configure to provision everything for

1039
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,119
evpn in a fully distributed

1040
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,119
fashion so you don't need a controller

1041
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:14,839
you don't need additional

1042
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,000
synchronization

1043
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,079
um you have enough information

1044
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,760
everywhere to derive what you need to

1045
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,800
configure a full evp and overlay

1046
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,640
so um when we started to work on the

1047
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,119
stuff

1048
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,559
you know a couple of things came up

1049
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,559
where we extended the architecture such

1050
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,200
you know

1051
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,559
simple first set of observations and

1052
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:35,359
solution

1053
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,839
with a couple of things that came up so

1054
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:38,640
uh

1055
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,880
one observation is that that works fine

1056
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,880
on fabrics with different you know

1057
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,640
number of parts different heights of

1058
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,720
parts different fan out in every part

1059
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,040
that is not a problem at all

1060
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,800
then we started to observe that if you

1061
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,240
watch evpn how it's deployed in 80 or 80

1062
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,200
plus of of the cases that we see is that

1063
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,280
people have two types of vlans they have

1064
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,800
vlans that they want to stay

1065
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,720
purely on the same fabric and they want

1066
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,960
vlans that may be stretched between

1067
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,000
fabrics

1068
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and all of a sudden you start to realize

1069
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,119
that

1070
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,079
the fabric id is a concept so if you

1071
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,000
want this thing to work over multiple

1072
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,960
fabrics

1073
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,079
arguably then you really want

1074
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,800
uh something like a fabric id which is

1075
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,599
still ztp

1076
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,359
because if you don't provide it you just

1077
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,040
take a default value take one

1078
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,800
and that's it and you run with it but if

1079
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,160
somebody wants something more

1080
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,000
sophisticated around multiple fabrics

1081
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,599
and stretch vlans

1082
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,319
then they will need the fabric id which

1083
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:36,720
they

1084
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,599
basically every switch needs a fabric id

1085
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,440
and then we can derive literally vlans

1086
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,040
that stretch and do not stretch

1087
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,559
and this little picture shows you the

1088
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,559
reference architecture the rrs are at

1089
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:47,440
the very top

1090
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,040
after long discussions that's where we

1091
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,040
ended up with and there's a bunch of

1092
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,160
them of course

1093
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,720
and then on the leaves we run running

1094
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,240
integrating irb

1095
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,599
also type five um so

1096
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,079
when you read the draft today it is

1097
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,839
sketchy because we didn't have much time

1098
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,040
to publish it

1099
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,599
so we omit right now all the computation

1100
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,359
of the values there is no type 5 and so

1101
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,119
all the architecture is fixed there is

1102
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:12,880
all the placeholders but we didn't feel

1103
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,359
the stuff in so next one so i show you a

1104
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:16,720
bunch of details to

1105
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,119
to show that this is not just a

1106
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,000
powerpoint

1107
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,280
that's actually pretty real um

1108
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,400
so if you a little bit you know ahead of

1109
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,000
the curve you will know what programming

1110
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,440
language that is

1111
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,359
but basically will provide all the

1112
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:32,640
derivation

1113
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,520
uh as algorithms because it's so complex

1114
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,319
that you know verbal description

1115
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,280
is iffy we have some very simple verbal

1116
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,559
description in terms of

1117
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,040
what kind of things influence very very

1118
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,720
derivation of the value but then we

1119
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,960
provide precise algorithm so

1120
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,200
uh here is an example of all the stuff

1121
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,280
that you have to pull out on all the

1122
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,040
leaves and all the route reflectors to

1123
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,200
configure so you need a cluster id

1124
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,280
you need a v6 look back you need a type

1125
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,280
5 v6 loopback which is different a type

1126
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,079
5v4 loopback and a bgp router id

1127
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,640
and the autonomous system and i'm

1128
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,319
showing you how this thing can be

1129
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,040
computed

1130
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,559
right so um in the decoding folder you

1131
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,000
see how

1132
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,480
um for example a cluster id is derived

1133
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,599
they write the same way

1134
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,400
as the private as and it's basically the

1135
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,839
fabric id

1136
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,720
uh which we shift a little bit and add

1137
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,160
it to the

1138
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,440
smallest private as and then we mold it

1139
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,280
to it you know so it doesn't run out of

1140
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,119
the private data space and that's good

1141
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,800
enough so you have a private aes which

1142
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,480
is fabric dependent you have a private

1143
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,599
as which is you know

1144
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,960
which can serve as a cluster id and i

1145
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,200
show you for example the router id that

1146
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,240
you derive

1147
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
and this is not only dependent on the

1148
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,280
fabric id

1149
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,800
right because on the same fabric

1150
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,720
everybody needs the same cluster id

1151
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,319
because we basically rock reflect over

1152
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,920
the same cluster

1153
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,319
multiple route reflectors and but the

1154
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,160
router id is derived not only from the

1155
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,400
fabric id but also from their

1156
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,680
system id right so what you do is you

1157
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,520
shift things a little bit around and you

1158
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,599
store a bunch of things

1159
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,520
and what i'm not showing we will be

1160
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,640
seeding with you know

1161
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,559
probably a small array of pretty good

1162
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,079
random numbers so the whole

1163
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,079
thing has you know lots of entropy going

1164
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,520
for it and

1165
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,400
um the architecture hinges on the fact

1166
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,400
that you will be running on the v6

1167
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,400
fabric because otherwise simply all the

1168
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,000
interface addressing the

1169
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,680
v4 interface addressing becomes

1170
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,119
unresolvable right you

1171
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,760
you somehow need to centralize instance

1172
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,160
that takes a 10 star slash 8

1173
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,319
and assigns everywhere unique addresses

1174
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,319
and that's a major pain

1175
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,960
whereas v6 will derive link local for

1176
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,640
you and they don't even have to be

1177
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,319
unique but they will be working fine and

1178
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,920
the v6 loopbacks we derive

1179
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,880
are good enough to provision dni's and

1180
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,720
run bgp sessions and so on

1181
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,440
so all this stuff will be flashed in um

1182
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,839
next one please

1183
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,720
all right so what do we have to add to

1184
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,280
rift

1185
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,200
um nothing but we choose to do a couple

1186
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,359
of optional things

1187
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,240
so there is a suggestion to add optional

1188
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,960
uh

1189
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,839
version on the lines and the ties and

1190
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,480
note ties only

1191
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,640
with the only purpose to prevent us from

1192
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,880
forming adjacencies between you know evp

1193
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,079
and version one and

1194
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,280
okp and version 2 for the future i think

1195
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:25,680
that

1196
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,800
is um a nice thing right because we

1197
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,800
don't want to mix that we also want to

1198
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,720
figure out if we have nodes within the

1199
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,599
fabric

1200
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:36,720
that do not support auto edpn and

1201
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,400
maybe shoot right there will form

1202
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,319
adjacencies to them but maybe the top of

1203
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,920
the fabric you can see the certain leaks

1204
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,839
do not run auto evpn

1205
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:45,119
and they will give you some you know

1206
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,839
useful information um

1207
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:50,400
and in case we want to really go

1208
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,599
multiplying support and we want

1209
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,640
a better route reflector

1210
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,160
architecture in the sense that we don't

1211
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,920
want too many route reflectors and we

1212
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,000
want to spread them across planes

1213
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,920
when we thought through the issues we'll

1214
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,000
need a new tie

1215
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,079
that only goes northbound on the tops

1216
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,839
which describes the plane basically all

1217
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,520
the system id of all that

1218
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,640
of of the whole plane um that has to do

1219
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,000
with the election algorithm if you look

1220
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,599
at the election algorithm in detail you

1221
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,400
understand that

1222
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,799
otherwise you'll not be able to spread

1223
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,960
across planes and then you know there is

1224
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,480
a different problem that if a single

1225
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,920
plane goes down you could take down all

1226
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,359
your rock reflectors and then

1227
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,599
flip over so the election algorithm is

1228
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,440
also built very carefully so

1229
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,520
a single guy joining kendall start you

1230
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,000
know flip sessions around

1231
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,680
uh what also comes now um is

1232
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,760
that there is a strong desire of course

1233
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,280
once you run something like that

1234
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,799
to have some information whether it came

1235
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:47,040
up

1236
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,960
whether all the bgp sessions are up you

1237
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,640
know and how many prefixes

1238
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:54,079
did did evpn um put

1239
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,799
on a leaf and so on so on the type 2 mac

1240
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,480
addresses for example

1241
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,599
and that we can do by basically sticking

1242
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,559
a bunch of

1243
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,880
things into the key value store and just

1244
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,160
flooding it up

1245
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,839
so that seems like a small investment

1246
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,000
it's strictly not protocol

1247
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,200
right but it's pretty handy because you

1248
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,040
don't ask people to deploy

1249
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,920
anything except rift and they get some

1250
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,640
minimal

1251
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,839
insight into their evpn

1252
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,359
being you know auto configuring and

1253
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:24,880
coming up and working and whether

1254
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,640
anything is wrong and what is

1255
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,280
roughly the scale on each leaf and so on

1256
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,880
um

1257
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,960
i think that's it next one i think it's

1258
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,000
the last one

1259
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,760
of the lot oh no uh yeah so we will fill

1260
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,839
in the algorithm we will add the type 5

1261
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:40,400
irb

1262
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,720
variables and algorithms as well which

1263
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,599
right now or

1264
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,960
are commented out um so

1265
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,359
the the key value thing i don't know

1266
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:50,559
what it should be

1267
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,480
part of this specification i think it

1268
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,640
should but maybe we pull out actually a

1269
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,520
different

1270
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,160
draft for that we welcome co-authorship

1271
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,640
whoever is interested in working on that

1272
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,079
uh as from to the implementation uh

1273
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,839
if you want to run the whole thing well

1274
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,920
you need the whole rift but if you just

1275
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,760
interested implementing um the leaf

1276
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,880
side of things uh a rift

1277
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,359
lift implementation is enough and as the

1278
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,680
basic spec describes it is actually much

1279
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,200
much simpler to implement the whole

1280
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,400
protocol right

1281
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,119
you basically you need a very very

1282
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,240
minimum flooding

1283
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,799
uh northbound and you're pretty much in

1284
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:29,359
the game

1285
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,839
and you can literally know you can also

1286
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,599
meet flood reduction economy between

1287
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,720
balance if you've got

1288
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,480
you know 80 percent of the spec if you

1289
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,720
just want the very very basic leaf

1290
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
implementation but you'll get enough

1291
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,079
information actually to

1292
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,200
fully participate in auto ebpm

1293
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,760
ah there was the last no is the next one

1294
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,640
no i think that's it

1295
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,640
so i think room for comments and

1296
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:09,839
questions now

1297
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,839
oh

1298
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,319
questions comments i

1299
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:34,160
cannot hear what you're saying

1300
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,119
where that is your friend questions

1301
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,119
comments

1302
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,119
hello can you hear me i can hear you

1303
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,240
oh i haven't read this draft but

1304
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:49,280
i'd like to know where this function be

1305
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,160
used

1306
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,200
if it will be used between p and

1307
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,799
c or it can replace the bgp control

1308
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:57,359
plane

1309
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,000
at all um

1310
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,960
no this is strictly aimed at at evpn

1311
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,400
right and what we're seeing is people

1312
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,359
are deploying

1313
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,319
ib fabrics and very very often they are

1314
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:11,200
deploying

1315
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,559
evpn on top of that to get l2

1316
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:17,680
um and they are deploying to the leaf or

1317
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,240
slowly towards the servers

1318
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,359
because of the multi-homing issues

1319
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,079
so the fabric starts to look like a one

1320
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,079
big ethernet switch to them

1321
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,400
in a sense with vlans and that's what

1322
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,680
we're addressing

1323
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,359
that's something that is being deployed

1324
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,240
a lot and you know preconditions have

1325
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,960
a significantly complex configuration

1326
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,880
and there are controller solutions but

1327
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,480
that's something where you could buy

1328
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
just three four switches and literally

1329
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,760
stick them together like ethernet

1330
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,640
switches

1331
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,559
and you get evpn with the same

1332
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:50,079
simplicity as deploying

1333
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,040
l2 i mean it will scale to much bigger

1334
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,640
scale at a certain point in time i think

1335
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,119
the manageability of such a thing

1336
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,760
will become iffy right but i don't know

1337
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,880
maybe people will

1338
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,400
i mean the rift will support it at any

1339
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,559
scale and so will evpn so

1340
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,359
you know sky's the limit really but it

1341
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,440
addresses you know a specific

1342
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,160
deployment use case which however which

1343
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,799
we see

1344
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:17,040
a lot of really a lot

1345
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,119
okay i will ask it in the

1346
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,520
end

1347
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,839
story sandy what did you say

1348
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,880
uh okay

1349
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,880
yes i think i just get little

1350
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,000
for your answers also i think i will

1351
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,720
i will send the question in the mailing

1352
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,359
list

1353
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,880
okay thank you to answer that and if

1354
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,599
you know if you want you know co-author
