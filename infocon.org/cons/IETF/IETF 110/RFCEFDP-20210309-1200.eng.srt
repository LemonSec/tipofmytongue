5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,919

ignorant just for the moment

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,799
uh on that point because otherwise we

20
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,080
won't get the meeting going and we have

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
to get the meeting going

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,080
um first of all welcome to the rfc

23
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
editor future program we need to really

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,320
start

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,080
um everybody uh i think on this call

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,920
has been um very actively participating

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,360
the group has been very active

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
uh thank you for that i know that a

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
number of people are double booked

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,759
and i i wish we could have done

31
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,280
something better about that maybe we'll

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,479
do something better about that in the

33
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:42,880
future

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,200
and the best thing we can do i think is

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,399
to be efficient in terms of

36
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,520
a uh um in terms of our proceedings

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840

um let's proceed just a little bit

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,480
further mark i'll try to moderate just a

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
little bit here

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,200
for you um all right here's our agenda

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,680
um

64
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,239
we've already successfully concluded uh

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:54,879
number one

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,480
on our agenda we have a little bit of

67
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
administrative to cover

68
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,959
um there's one thing that isn't on the

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:01,440
agenda

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,519
here which i'll just mention uh towards

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,480
the end

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,159
um we're going to continue on the

73
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,840
proposal that adrian had with a bit of a

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,440
perhaps a tweak to it um or or a slight

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,159
alternate from joel uh joel so that you

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,840
know i've um

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,200
upload um i've uploaded your

78
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,480
um uh your slides so uh

79
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,760
if you want you can present them or i

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,599
can present we'll get that to you

81
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,280
we'll get to you in just a little bit um

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
i saw you uploaded thank you you want to

83
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,519
present them or you want me to joel

84
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,560
if you present them okay um

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,159
very good i will do that it will take me

86
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,000
just a moment to bring them up but

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,480
patience will be required okay

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,640
we will then take some discussion

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,439
um i suspect we may not get beyond

90
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
item number three here in terms of the

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
issues

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
um but if we do um everybody's getting

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
an ice cream

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
um because that that would be really

95
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
hard work um

96
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,280
done and uh it would be really nice to

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,959
be able to this this is a big

98
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,279
once we get beyond this it's i think we

99
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,880
will really have momentum to complete

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,399
our tasks

101
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,079
um there are some other issues we can

102
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,400
then tackle if we do have a little extra

103
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,199
time

104
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
uh we do have a next meeting date i'll

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,040
talk about that in a little a little bit

106
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,680
and insert uh somewhere between that in

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,320
the end

108
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
um we now also have a volunteer for a

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
document editor you do for those of you

110
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
who have read email

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
for those of you who are just getting up

112
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,520
you may not have seen that

113
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,479
and um so you'll get some news in a

114
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
little bit

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
um any agenda bashing

116
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
okay um brian's gonna be managing the

117
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
floor and interrupting me

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,639
regularly if need be in order for the

119
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,639
floor to um

120
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,440
uh in order to to do that so because i

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,720
sometimes don't see the the floor

122
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,080
requests

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
um all right your floor requests this

124
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,000
cue in the

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
uh in the chat

126
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,720
yeah okay moving right along

127
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,240
um so i just by way of review we

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
you some of you may recall adrian spent

129
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,080
some time he put forward

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,120
a um a proposal

131
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
we think we have agreement on the not so

132
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,960
controversial stuff

133
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,840
um and uh we just uh you'll see that

134
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,039
there are a couple questions at the end

135
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
that's from our last interim

136
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,440
um things that we have to work out just

137
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
a little bit of detail around in terms

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,479
of document adoption

139
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,160
i don't think i think these are separate

140
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,520
from from

141
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,120
uh or i wouldn't say separate i think

142
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
these are just in addition to this

143
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,720
in what's in a

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
so we we pretty much agreed that you

145
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
know the working group is going to go

146
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
through its its process to develop

147
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,240
documents

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
and then you know gain rough consensus

149
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
roughly speaking using the same sort of

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,120
processes

151
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
uh that you would see in an ietf working

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,800
group um

153
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
we agree that there will be a working

154
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
group last call

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,120
um i think uh where it says how long

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,759
does the

157
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,440
last call last i think we read it would

158
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
be two to four weeks

159
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,639
uh depending on the uh the the

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,960
the document uh used with the chair

161
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,680
using uh

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,039
discussion um and i see from

163
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,639
um uh uh peter santo dre that he's

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,600
having some

165
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
technical issues um so uh officially

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
if you want to direct anything to peter

167
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,960
um you should do so in jabber

168
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
um or at least he'll reply to you at

169
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,440
jabra because he's on the audio stream

170
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,360
the other audio stream

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,160
um then there's the um

172
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,840
[Music]

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
the working group will then consider a

174
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
public comments review

175
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,560
i say read here well we have to figure

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
out where to send it um

177
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
and and then there's a little there

178
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
really is a little bit more work to do

179
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
here just in terms of

180
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,199
handling resolution after the working

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
group last call if things changed you

182
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,000
need to issue another one

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,199
and i'm sure that there's going to be

184
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
some words about you know

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,319
the chairs are going to need to use a

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
little bit of judgment if

187
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,759
um the you know if it's not a big deal

188
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,759
in terms of the tweaks um probably the

189
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,280
last call isn't called for if they're

190
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,880
big tweets probably a last call is

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,400
called for

192
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,440
um so uh

193
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,759
then we got into uh participation by

194
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,280
members the approval group

195
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,319
um here we didn't actually uh

196
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,960
finish up um what we were what uh

197
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,199
uh who hey who the approval body is

198
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,800
we didn't even even talk about that in

199
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,319
the last meeting really

200
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,960
um and it was just sort of assumed that

201
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,879
it was the stream managers but we

202
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,720
i think we have a couple of different

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,319
ideas floating around there

204
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
um the other thing that uh we left open

205
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,759
is what happens if somebody can't

206
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,919
participate should there be an alternate

207
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
this is something that miriam proposed

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
and we can close on that so these are

209
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,599
some things we probably need to close on

210
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,639
here

211
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,919
um then there is uh further discussion

212
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,400
um one of the things we i think we said

213
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,560
we were pretty close to done on this one

214
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,639
and the only thing is that we think

215
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,639
probably and this is something i believe

216
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,199
mike st

217
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,520
john suggested um was that we should

218
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
just move this either into or directly

219
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
behind c

220
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,240
in terms of um uh once the

221
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,280
uh the working group uh sends the the

222
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,279
document off that this is what happens

223
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,120
next

224
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,640
um and this is about as far as we got

225
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,919
uh f we we talked uh we talked

226
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,959
about whether there would be a yes

227
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
no abstain discuss and we've had a

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,959
couple of proposals since then

229
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,519
including return to working group and

230
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,519
you'll see i think another one from

231
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,760
uh from joel in his proposal

232
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,720
there was a i think a pretty healthy

233
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,160
debate about this

234
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,360
and we need to firm up

235
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
our positions here i i don't think these

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,720
are are

237
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
as i think i said in an email i don't

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
think anything here

239
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
is a um it's a show stopper we're just

240
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,480
uh

241
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
we're just uh polishing a little bit on

242
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,040
what the what the names are and i think

243
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,560
uh whether we need these other

244
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,320
components and the abstain

245
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
aspect here this ties directly about to

246
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,399
whether there's an alternate one of the

247
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,920
issues that was raised

248
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,320
uh the last time is who what would the

249
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
alternate be

250
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,519
for the independent submissions editor

251
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,480
stream

252
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,920
and that would be something that would

253
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
have to be worked through

254
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,640
then reasons for discuss uh

255
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,600
here again we had some issues relating

256
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
to

257
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,250
um

258
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,320
[Music]

259
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
this was relating to why somebody might

260
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
uh raise a

261
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,120
discuss or a return to group or

262
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,360
a um uh um

263
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,480
uh the or whatever uh uh i think it's a

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,120
concern

265
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
that joel is gonna mention later um and

266
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,920
so there were sort of three choices

267
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,560
right

268
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,360
uh that we had in here um and i think

269
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
everybody

270
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,120
was pretty comfortable with this um

271
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,920
there was uh

272
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,200
some amount of angst over this and

273
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
um some amount of angst over this um but

274
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,760
there was no consensus necessarily to

275
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
remove

276
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
those just yet but no consensus to to

277
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
move forward

278
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,920
and so we'll need to go through that a

279
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
little bit more

280
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
in terms of how we're proceeding

281
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,079
and i believe yeah that is pretty much

282
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,680
as far as we got um

283
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,360
and uh so um with that

284
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,600
um what i propose is to just pause for a

285
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
moment um

286
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
does anybody have any questions not

287
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,920
does not i'm not asking for debate at

288
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
this point just questions

289
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
about um the preceding uh meeting

290
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,320
or um other topics

291
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
okay i'm gonna

292
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,279
i'm just gonna see if i can fiddle with

293
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
the display to make sure that i'm not

294
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,720
missing anybody i don't think i think

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,399
brian would tell me that

296
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,160
um okay oh there's eric

297
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,959
welcome eric

298
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,518
and good morning to you

299
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,680
eric if you're in the queue you can go

300
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
ahead if you're

301
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,279
not in the queue please just remove

302
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,680
yourself

303
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,720
okay don't know if we have a tools

304
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,519
problem

305
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
looks like eric's asking for the floor

306
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,800
to me

307
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,240
but um i don't know if i uh

308
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
if if if any we have to do anything here

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
to otherwise

310
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,040
help eric but no he's got he's out now

311
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
okay all right um

312
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,519
so what i propose to do at this point

313
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,240
then is

314
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,680
to invite joel to present

315
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,680
the work that he's done i will ask you

316
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,920
to just bear with me as i bring up

317
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
his slides did i put them in

318
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,120
just a moment i think i thought i had

319
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,279
but i guess i did not okay um

320
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,200
just a moment if it really if it'll make

321
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
things easier i guess i can present them

322
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,880
i just

323
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,399
thought it would be cleaner if you just

324
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,480
kept control of the screen

325
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,399
let me just make sure that i ha ha

326
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,880
wait a minute i have to share i have to

327
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
reshare just a moment

328
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
i have these guys up you just can't see

329
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,000
them um

330
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,880
let's see okay while you while you're

331
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,240
bringing them up i'll just comment

332
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
the first few sides are recapitulation

333
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
because i wasn't sure

334
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,120
how much context would be set and uh and

335
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,639
when i was writing the slides i wanted

336
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
to make sure i had a context in my head

337
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,959
so just if the first

338
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,959
couple look like recapitulation it's

339
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,519
cause they are

340
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,240
okay it should be just a moment

341
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
here we go

342
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,959
all right there we are let's go to the

343
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,880
this is my effort to try to put some

344
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,639
proposal on the table based on what

345
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,079
we've seen before

346
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,560
as we said there will be a working group

347
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,120
open to everybody

348
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,040
they'll use procedures somewhat modified

349
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
after the classic ietf procedures and

350
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,399
for this purpose i didn't want to get

351
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,240
into all the details of that

352
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,000
we've had some discussion go on

353
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,279
next slide please and there is an

354
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,880
approvals board

355
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
um actually can you go to no full screen

356
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,440
will kill you

357
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,279
um i'm afraid people are going to have

358
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
trouble reading these they're a little

359
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
it's looking a little small on my screen

360
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
there that helps thank you

361
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,839
uh so there will be an approvals board

362
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,120
as uh elliott just went through

363
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,000
and the some of the details of of what

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,519
the approvals board is

365
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,040
is what we're going to try to go through

366
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,000
right now next slide

367
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,399
so the basic process i'm focused again

368
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,199
on

369
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,959
the approvals board here when the

370
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,120
working group finishes a document

371
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
and approves it for adoption it goes to

372
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,440
the approvals board

373
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,279
while the document is being circulated

374
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,760
to a larger community as was mentioned

375
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
the board members will carefully review

376
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
the document as we said we expect them

377
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
to have already participated in the

378
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,480
working group

379
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,320
but they need to review it at this point

380
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,079
after a suitable time and i'm being

381
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,079
deliberately vague on the time

382
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,079
my own preferences in terms of time for

383
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,760
the approvals board is to leave it to

384
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,240
them

385
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,560
but we can to work out their procedures

386
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,600
but we that's the detail we can specify

387
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,480
the only votes that they are allowed to

388
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,440
register

389
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,959
are yes concern and recuse

390
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,399
recuse is specifically for i have a

391
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,199
conflict

392
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,880
i can't appropriately vote on this

393
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
and if a document is approved if all the

394
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,519
votes are yes or recused and if a weird

395
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,800
case for

396
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,279
all but one member recused and the

397
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,560
remaining one says yes

398
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
it's approved i'm not worrying about

399
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,920
weird corner cases you must have a

400
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
minimum

401
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,600
in fact if they all recuse then it

402
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,440
becomes approved it's just too bad

403
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,440
i oops i went with concern as the name

404
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,800
for the other vote i listened to the

405
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,839
discussion

406
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,639
i didn't want the name of the position

407
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,720
to be the same as the disposition so i

408
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
didn't like return to working group as

409
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,959
the name of the vote

410
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,720
and there was concern about disgust

411
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,320
because of the burden and just

412
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,839
concerned about no because of its

413
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
implications so i'm suggesting

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,160
we call the position somebody is taking

415
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,040
that is an

416
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,079
explicit position and not yes to be

417
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,519
concerned i expressing a concern

418
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,320
about the document that is enough the

419
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,199
concern that

420
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,000
something needs to be dealt with next

421
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,399
slide

422
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,759
so and i tried to keep things simple

423
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,880
there are only two kinds of concerns and

424
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
all of them must be accompanied by clear

425
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,639
and understandable explanations of what

426
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,120
it is

427
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,120
the problem i'm not unlike the iesg

428
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,160
discuss policy they may not be

429
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,519
actionable i can't if

430
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,920
the concern is this will destroy the

431
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,800
stream

432
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,079
i don't want to insist they they specify

433
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,079
a specific action to fix it that the

434
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,079
concern is the concern so i'm not saying

435
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,519
it must be actionable

436
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,799
but it has to be clear and

437
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,559
understandable

438
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,240
the first kind of reason is causing a

439
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,079
serious problem for the group that a

440
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,439
particular member is charged to

441
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,079
represent

442
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
i picked that wording to be able to

443
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,839
separate out

444
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,199
what was the third category of

445
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,000
concern in the earlier proposal to keep

446
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,559
it

447
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,679
much cleaner if somebody is on the

448
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
on the approvals board charged with

449
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
representing foo

450
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,039
and this causes serious problems for foo

451
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
then that's a concern that they have the

452
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
right to raise

453
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,240
and the second kind therefore is

454
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,720
a concern that causes serious harm to

455
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,080
the overall series

456
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,760
including the long-term health and

457
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,440
viability

458
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,640
and this is explicitly any board member

459
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,160
any member of the approvals board can

460
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240
raise this i'm not saying there's one

461
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
person who's charged with this

462
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,880
in fact by serving on this board all of

463
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
the members are agreeing to be looking

464
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,400
out for this

465
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
so these are the criteria i'm proposing

466
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,120
are there any questions about the

467
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
criteria piece not about what happens

468
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,480
with them but just

469
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,520
these two criteria

470
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,360
okay let's go to the next slide

471
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
mike go ahead while he's going to the

472
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,799
next slide

473
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,039
mike

474
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
sorry i have to relearn after we learn

475
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
the whole thing um

476
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,559
yeah cur concern serious concern versus

477
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,280
concern

478
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,840
sorry um serious harm versus harm

479
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,039
i i don't know that it needs to be even

480
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,440
serious i think if there's a problem

481
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
that needs to be identified not just a

482
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,760
uh

483
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,120
yeah we're going we're to have to re i i

484
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,559
think if you've got to reword something

485
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,080
on a stream it's a harm

486
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,600
so just don't go that far

487
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,360
just go go with harman problem

488
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,720
yes please okay

489
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
i'm not going to try to edit them on the

490
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,000
fly but i think whoever's taking minutes

491
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,799
can note that

492
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,200
and assuming that the new document

493
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,280
editor ends up turning this into text in

494
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,760
a draft assuming we actually agree to it

495
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,280
then they can whatever we agree on that

496
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,480
can become

497
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
things ecker i think has a responding

498
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,080
position go ahead eric

499
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,799
ecker can you unmute if not type in the

500
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,840
chat and i'll repeat now

501
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
sorry sorry sorry i'm like trying to

502
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,720
like follow two working groups i'm not

503
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,679
doing it very well

504
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,120
um i mean so like

505
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
uh i'll actually want to find the exact

506
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,400
wording here but i want to register that

507
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,880
like

508
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,960
any proposal that is worth doing is

509
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
going to cause some inconvenience to

510
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,039
somebody

511
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,080
and so the idea that like if it causes

512
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,360
any harm whatsoever

513
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
like that you know the the stream

514
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,960
managers are empowered to block it

515
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,840
like does not lexing awesome so um like

516
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,480
i i i

517
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,600
so i i guess i was um uh i was pretty

518
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,320
comfortable

519
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,159
um after some thinking uh so first of

520
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,600
all joel thanks for this together um i

521
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,480
such as that first

522
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,240
um uh i was pretty comfortable from

523
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,480
thinking with the set of criteria um

524
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,240
in part because like i just came to the

525
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
conclusion that trying to really like

526
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,640
nail it down it's like not gonna work

527
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,280
super well

528
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,799
um but i think we should try to get

529
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,640
people the right idea and the right idea

530
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,440
is

531
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,799
like you know um that

532
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,280
did that you know like if you're if

533
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,159
you're actually letting someone have

534
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,520
that kind of vague position then it has

535
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
to be like it has to be pretty like that

536
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
as opposed to just like i think this is

537
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
going to cause some minor difficulty um

538
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,520
because like i say anything is going to

539
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,840
cause some difficulty um anyway i think

540
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,400
we can

541
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,440
but i think generally i think this is

542
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,720
pretty selfless so i'm like willing to

543
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,760
fight that battle

544
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
like a later point

545
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,520
okay we're good thanks for that ecker

546
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,440
and i want to just acknowledge

547
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,120
um uh the difficulty again of

548
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
that the conflicts that that

549
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,320
particularly you are having to sustain

550
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,679
in terms of this meaning and i know

551
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,280
others are too

552
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,440
all right joel okay let's

553
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,760
uh brian asked in the chat do we need

554
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,880
recuse

555
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
if we have alternates i was actually not

556
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,559
assuming there were

557
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,480
alternates in part because it gets

558
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
really confusing suppose there's two

559
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
documents on the table

560
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,960
and somebody is saying i can't vote on a

561
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,120
but i can i'll take care of my job on b

562
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,280
do we have an alternate for a

563
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
it just struck me as creating a

564
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
complication that

565
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,360
that we don't need and recusal should be

566
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
extraordinarily rare so i just thought

567
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,039
it was much simpler to focus on

568
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,919
these are the members these are the the

569
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,080
recusal conditions

570
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,240
and

571
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,919
that that's why i wrote it this way

572
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,159
um i i didn't go for alternates and all

573
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,280
of the

574
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,200
my i'm trying to keep this simple

575
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,120
because if we make it too complicated

576
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,640
we will find we have written corner

577
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,400
cases that don't work the way we want

578
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,960
but back to serious significant versus

579
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,440
just

580
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
leaving out the word serious i have no

581
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,360
problem personally if we change serious

582
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,480
to significant

583
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,919
that's that's a mass next for me i do

584
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:24,240
think

585
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
actually we want to emphasize that it's

586
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,880
got to rise to a noticeable level

587
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
and i disagree with mike that just any

588
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,480
harm

589
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,159
but let's go to the next slide because i

590
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,840
believe there were

591
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,039
questions about that too but i wanted to

592
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,080
get the positions on

593
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,320
before we got to what do we do about

594
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,480
them

595
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,400
so the question then becomes how what

596
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
happens if somebody raises a concern

597
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
the desired approach would be that the

598
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,520
working group

599
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,080
listens and goes oh okay we'll just fix

600
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
it

601
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,280
but that is presumably unlikely as the

602
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
natural outcome no matter

603
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,039
but everybody should always and hold the

604
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,320
whole process keep in mind that's what

605
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,640
would be the desired result

606
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
a suitable fix is found the working

607
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,000
group does it and we move on

608
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,159
but presumably this was already raised

609
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,360
during the working group because we've

610
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
already said

611
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,799
all the members of the approvals board

612
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,080
have to be participating

613
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,240
in the working group that's their

614
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
commitment as part of this

615
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,159
they they have to be raising their

616
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,240
concerns i mean we won't write into the

617
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,679
rules they have to if they find the

618
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
concern at the last minute they can

619
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
raise it but

620
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,679
it would be expected

621
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,679
that they would raise things during that

622
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,880
that's their job

623
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,039
so

624
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,000
that's what so that so that's well the

625
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,400
out desired outcome

626
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,440
not i don't actually expect it to happen

627
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,400
so then what happens

628
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,559
after an appropriate amount of time and

629
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,400
as i said i'm being vague about times if

630
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,080
we need to we can nail them if we can

631
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,279
leave it to the

632
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,480
board that's fine there's a a formal

633
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,200
vote can

634
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
can be taken to override the concern

635
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,760
and if only one board member has the

636
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,120
concern

637
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,240
that's it the rest of them say no the

638
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,600
override is done

639
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,480
the document is approved if after the

640
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,039
discussion at least two board members

641
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,880
presumably the one raising conservative

642
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,640
at least one more i don't know how else

643
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,760
you'd get to

644
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,679
be really weird for person a to raise

645
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
the concern decided it doesn't apply but

646
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,320
persons b and c didn't apply the concern

647
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,039
but

648
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,640
the way i've written it it would still

649
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,120
be there

650
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,960
if they really feel that's a show

651
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,840
stopper then the document is returned to

652
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,200
the working group but the work group can

653
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
do whatever it likes with it but

654
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,720
the working group will be aware of the

655
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
substance they're concerned and

656
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,360
that it's unlikely to be approved until

657
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,720
something

658
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,320
is fixed uh yes this allows the working

659
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,799
group to keep sending it back if that

660
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,679
and i don't know i'd i'd rather try to

661
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,200
solve that problem i think everybody

662
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,080
would realize

663
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,240
wait we have a problem here and they'll

664
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,679
figure out a way to solve it if that's

665
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,520
what's happening

666
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,919
so keeping it simple but focusing on

667
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,360
there's an override if there's

668
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,879
if there's only one person with the

669
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,159
procedure

670
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,840
so um um

671
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,000
this general thing seems plausible um i

672
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,360
like would like to put a pin

673
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
in the question of how many people we

674
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,400
need to override because

675
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,919
um there's a subsequent question about

676
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,600
whether the rsc is part of this board

677
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,120
and um why i'm comfortable with this

678
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,400
number if the rsc is not part of this

679
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,240
board i'm most comfortable with this

680
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
so um like uh so i wanna like i wanna i

681
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,360
wanna

682
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,360
i wanna approve that say i approve this

683
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,039
except i have a wanna put like a like a

684
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,320
red circle on the two uh

685
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,799
on the two or something right fair

686
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,080
enough

687
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
and we'll get back to the membership in

688
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,480
in the slide or two

689
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
because that is indeed an important

690
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,880
question

691
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,520
okay next so there and there is

692
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,880
the membership and relationship my view

693
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
is to keep this small

694
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,760
and that it would be and my proposal is

695
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
it's the stream heads which is currently

696
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,480
four

697
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,480
that could number could go up or down

698
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,559
and things happen

699
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
and the paid professional technical

700
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,080
publishing expert which is the

701
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,679
the long phrase i use for what we're

702
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,440
calling the rse or rsa

703
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,120
or whatever i just i wanted to be clear

704
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,880
there are no explicit term limits on

705
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
those members there are no

706
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,799
members appointed by any other bodies

707
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,240
because it seemed to me that would just

708
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,919
make things

709
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,120
really hard i mean trying to put term

710
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,159
limits on

711
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,840
the stream representative seems to be

712
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,760
putting limits on the way the streams do

713
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,440
things they all have their own policies

714
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,960
which provide term limits

715
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,320
putting a term limit on the paid

716
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,640
professional technical publishing expert

717
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,919
seemed exactly backwards experiences

718
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,159
what we want with that person

719
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,440
uh there is no

720
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,840
formal appeals process in this proposal

721
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,880
this was one of the things that was

722
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,320
discussed last time and so i thought it

723
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,000
was important to say

724
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,840
there's two reasons why i wrote that

725
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,360
this way

726
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,240
first it hurt my head every time i went

727
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,919
to think about the appeals process i

728
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,760
went who would you appeal to on what

729
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,960
basis

730
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,279
how would you it hurt my head maybe we

731
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,720
could craft something but it

732
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,360
didn't seem it was worth the ma the pain

733
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,720
because

734
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
all of the board members including the

735
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,919
paid professional are responsible to

736
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,960
somebody

737
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,880
the paid professional is responsible to

738
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
their contracting authority

739
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,799
the stream representatives are

740
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,080
responsible to

741
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,760
whomever appoints the stream head

742
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,120
whether that's whether it is the irtf

743
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,120
chair who's appointed by the iab whether

744
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,559
it is the ise

745
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,600
whether it is the itf chair

746
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,720
or the iab chair or their delegate

747
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
it's those people are responsible to

748
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,159
somebody

749
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,320
given how long the other appeals

750
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,520
processes take

751
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,000
and how ineffective they are if somebody

752
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
is messing up

753
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
and really for somebody to be messing up

754
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,520
on this board in a way that matters

755
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
you'd have to have at least two people

756
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,600
messing up

757
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,080
for there to be reasons to appeal at

758
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,159
which point i'm going

759
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,919
trying to figure out how to unwind

760
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,559
conspiracy is beyond me

761
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,559
mark you have a comment hang on just a

762
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,640
moment before before mark and eric go

763
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,440
forward

764
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
um i want to just talk about structuring

765
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,520
discussion

766
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,720
on this slide because there's a lot here

767
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,200
okay a whole lot here and what i'll ask

768
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,480
is um

769
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,399
what what i'd like to do is sort of go

770
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,320
bullet by bullet

771
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,399
and just see you know let's see if we're

772
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,799
all in in general agreement

773
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,440
on on and let's find out where we have

774
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,320
issues

775
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,880
if people will bear with me on that so

776
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,080
let's start with

777
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,159
i think nobody's really disagreeing with

778
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,080
this but if you do disagree

779
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,440
now is the time throw up a hand and

780
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,279
indicate whether you think that this is

781
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,039
an incorrect a

782
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,000
an inappropriate statement okay um so

783
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,960
mark if if

784
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
if you uh if if you disagree with this

785
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
point go ahead and and speak

786
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,640
otherwise bear with me for a minute okay

787
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,840
i'm not seeing any hands

788
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,399
um all right then the next part i'm

789
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,200
going to say

790
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,760
i think we all are pretty comfortable

791
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,559
with

792
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,080
this part here right any

793
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,960
comments concerns about the stream heads

794
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,320
i think we've been over this multiple

795
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:40,720
times

796
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,640
i'm not expecting any objections but

797
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,039
i'll give you the opportunity now

798
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,399
all right not seeing hands now we have

799
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,440
this part here okay uh

800
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,360
and then okay that was the hand i was

801
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,200
expecting i'm sure there might be others

802
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,320
uh eric go ahead

803
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
i mean i think i think someone else has

804
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,720
not muted

805
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
that might be me okay

806
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,240
uh so i actually agree with what i'm not

807
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,360
saying which is having the discussions

808
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,559
for the tiny little pieces like this is

809
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,760
not super helpful so i just want to

810
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,200
surface that that may not be the most

811
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,080
useful thing

812
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,000
um um but uh that wouldn't get up to say

813
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,840
that um uh

814
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,399
uh to recap i think my position from uh

815
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,200
from from

816
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,360
like last time um i think that the

817
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
stream heads have a form of democratic

818
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
legitimacy which is they were appointed

819
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,039
by

820
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,559
structure and by uh you know um

821
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,559
by the organization as a whole and the

822
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,679
um the rs

823
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,720
rc ppe whatever it is is not and

824
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080
so i so well i think that they're they

825
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,120
have an important voice and i think we

826
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,399
have structure allows another voice and

827
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,200
not think there should be

828
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
a decision making a loop um i think we

829
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
need a clear distinction between people

830
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,960
who are

831
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,200
like democratically or community

832
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,240
appointed people who are

833
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,000
um who are engaged to professionals

834
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
mike

835
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,399
yeah that's one way of thinking about it

836
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,600
the other way of thinking about it is

837
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,760
this person's out of responsibility

838
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,000
and has to be involved with the

839
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
selection of things that are going to

840
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,320
fall within their responsibility

841
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,159
now i know going to come along and say

842
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,360
go well they're not a member of the

843
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,159
community they're just hired people

844
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,679
this is how we got in the problem in the

845
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,279
first place this is not

846
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,640
just a contractor this is a senior

847
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
member of the community and we want them

848
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,360
to be

849
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,960
we want them to be there for quite a

850
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,399
while um

851
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,000
again i'm when you said

852
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,760
small approvals board i skipped over

853
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
because i thought i would get a chance

854
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,880
to talk about additional people besides

855
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,399
these five people

856
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,679
so can we come back to that later on um

857
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,320
elliot sure

858
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,840
okay um

859
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,640
just that eckhart's point of point about

860
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
pigs and chickens really

861
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
really matters here uh and the the

862
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,159
stream heads are

863
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,120
directly responsible for something that

864
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,039
will be affected by this

865
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,159
uh i don't see that the the advisor as

866
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,919
an as an expert with opinions

867
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,279
has the same degree of uh commitment to

868
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,720
to actually being responsible for

869
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,200
something and so

870
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,919
as i said give them ample opportunity to

871
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,799
make their voice heard but

872
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:43,840
saying no on what basis

873
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:56,159
um mark

874
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,279
did that work yeah

875
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,480
okay lots of buttons to click um

876
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,559
so yeah i agree with you know one of

877
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,919
these things is is not

878
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,200
like the others the the the mechanism

879
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,880
for assuring that the the rsa or i see

880
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,760
whatever we call this

881
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,720
person is aligned with and and acting in

882
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,240
a responsible fashion

883
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,320
is is different than the all the

884
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,559
mechanisms for the stream managers

885
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,519
and so i i'm somewhat confident that you

886
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:25,919
know

887
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,200
as described you know that a single

888
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,399
person can't

889
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,240
necessarily carry the day with this they

890
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,360
have to convince someone else i think

891
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,679
that that's a reasonable constraint

892
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,120
but i do think that this really

893
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,559
highlights that we need to consider

894
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,480
you know this person needs some freedom

895
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,840
of action and they need some comfort

896
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,120
that they're going to keep in position i

897
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,159
absolutely agree

898
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,679
but we also need to make sure that this

899
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,440
person is not serving the community well

900
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,240
and is or or they go off the rails we

901
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,159
have an effective way

902
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,519
to you know either either address that

903
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,320
behavior or

904
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,559
or ultimately replace them that doesn't

905
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,159
involve blowing up the entire

906
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:02,880
organization

907
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,799
and starting a new program the id every

908
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,000
time that happens

909
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,800
hopefully it's not a common occurrence

910
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
but i do think we need to think about

911
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,560
that potential future

912
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,760
yeah let me just interject on that point

913
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,199
um mark that i think

914
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,800
that's well said in terms of um

915
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,320
not wanting to have to go through this

916
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,399
again um so

917
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,639
uh one of the things that i think people

918
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,679
should be thinking about

919
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,839
is as we as we begin to compile this

920
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,918
proposal have we achieved that goal

921
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,359
and i don't think it's any one

922
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,760
particular thing relating to the rsc or

923
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,359
relating to you know the rsoc or other

924
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,159
things

925
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,839
but people might have different views as

926
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,159
to how you know how we got here

927
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,879
but if you read through the proposal do

928
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,520
you think

929
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,239
you know as as it develops right as as

930
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,679
as it gets edited up

931
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,560
you think we're meeting that goal uh so

932
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,359
uh thanks for

933
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,320
for raising that point

934
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,400
we do meet that goal then my concern

935
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,359
about this point

936
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,880
is i think largely addressed if there is

937
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,760
an effective

938
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
you know mechanism just like the stream

939
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,800
editors

940
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
then this is probably okay this is

941
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,280
certainly in the ballpark

942
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,119
yeah thank you adrian yes so

943
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,880
um i like what mark said um i think that

944
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,440
both

945
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,720
the ability to um

946
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,160
override a single position

947
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,440
and the understanding of

948
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,800
how a hired professional uh

949
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,119
might be constrained by their employers

950
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,880
is important i also think it's important

951
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,079
to understand

952
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,000
what the remit of this hired

953
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,880
professional is

954
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,720
and possibly this was something mike was

955
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,640
coming towards but i don't think

956
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,119
we have in this structure addressed who

957
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,320
is responsible for

958
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,359
um the the needs of

959
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,040
the uh the consumers

960
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,480
and contributors to the rfcs beyond

961
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,240
the the streams and i know we talked

962
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,079
about this before and we kind of pushed

963
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,280
it around a bit

964
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,480
but we didn't as far as i recall ever

965
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,839
say uh who carried

966
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,320
that that responsibility so if for

967
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
example somebody is sitting there in the

968
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,839
advisory board

969
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,640
uh approvals board sorry uh and sees

970
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,040
that

971
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,079
an action would be harmful to a

972
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,480
significant proportion of the people

973
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,560
that consume the rfcs

974
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,400
but um not specifically harmful to the

975
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,520
streams

976
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,359
then i don't see how that

977
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,440
issue gets raised unless it belongs to

978
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,960
somebody and

979
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,640
perhaps it belongs to the technical

980
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,560
publishing expert and perhaps it doesn't

981
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,520
but without

982
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,880
that job spec we don't know

983
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,839
yeah so um this issue has been raised

984
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,440
before stick with me for just a moment

985
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,160
adrian

986
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,240
um just to recount the the last time

987
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,359
we we covered this ground um i believe

988
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,079
there was

989
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,079
uh one view that stood out to me which

990
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,640
is

991
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,280
that that aspect like how do we even

992
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,359
establish accountability to this

993
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,079
this broader community that aspect

994
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,839
needed to be developed and that is

995
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,000
probably something that could be done

996
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,720
by the the working group that gets

997
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
created out of this

998
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,200
process this is what i uh heard and saw

999
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,520
from

1000
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,359
uh from from that discussion and i think

1001
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,720
stephen farrell

1002
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,440
had had comments on that in particular

1003
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,240
so

1004
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,680
one question uh i think we have to ask

1005
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,680
is is this something that we solve now

1006
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,200
or something that we solve

1007
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,480
uh as we as we evolve uh the process

1008
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,000
and do you have thoughts on that adrian

1009
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,000
well in in general and assuming

1010
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,599
um best will and good behavior on all

1011
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,480
parts

1012
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
yeah um we can we can

1013
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,040
leave that till later there is a slight

1014
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,680
corner case of well what happens if

1015
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,119
something bad happens

1016
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,560
in the uh in the first few months

1017
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,640
before that piece of process has been

1018
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,359
sorted out

1019
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,800
thank you very much uh joel okay

1020
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,160
so just to touch on adrian's point the

1021
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,320
wording on the

1022
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,520
on the specific the first kind of

1023
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,920
concern was specifically written so that

1024
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,000
if we decide somebody represents some

1025
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,040
particular constant

1026
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,160
constituency like the readers or

1027
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,040
whatever then that would that would then

1028
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,880
fall into the rest of the process so we

1029
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,480
could separate the two pieces of what

1030
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,680
are the votes

1031
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,240
and what are the representations on the

1032
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
bigger issue this is the point where

1033
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,359
ecker and

1034
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,400
and i and and that

1035
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,480
i think i fear that this whole camp is

1036
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,440
split

1037
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,680
i think that it is very important that

1038
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,839
the paid professional the rsa

1039
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,200
be a full voting member of the

1040
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,400
of this board and one of one example of

1041
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,240
that was the idea that somebody floated

1042
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,040
in the chat

1043
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,480
that there might be a situation where

1044
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,920
the rest of the board could go into

1045
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
executive session without them

1046
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,839
separate from a recusal by the by the uh

1047
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,839
by the professional obviously if the

1048
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,599
topic is how much is the professional

1049
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,680
paid or whether they're paid

1050
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,440
they would recuse but separate from that

1051
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,480
question

1052
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,440
i just don't want to see it set up where

1053
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,000
they are

1054
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,520
not a full member of this board and

1055
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,119
one of the ways you recognize who are

1056
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,440
your full members or who gets to say in

1057
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,760
the end

1058
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,000
and i think it's very important they

1059
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
have as much of a say as anyone else

1060
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,319
and that's why i put in an explicit

1061
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,560
override while i prefer to keep it to

1062
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,079
one vote i can even live

1063
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,200
with ecker with it being requiring two

1064
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,079
other members

1065
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,680
to sustain the vote so that it

1066
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,800
but but that's

1067
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,560
i'm much more concerned that they have a

1068
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
full voting member

1069
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,040
because otherwise we get a relationship

1070
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,760
that is not

1071
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,680
in my view as healthy thank you

1072
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,800
thanks joel uh we'll be back uh colin

1073
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,319
yeah yeah um yeah i

1074
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,920
um i i'm understanding the uh that the

1075
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,720
reasons for the stream heads

1076
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
to have a vote here because they have

1077
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
the the legitimacy to represent that

1078
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,839
their streams uh

1079
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,839
and they are they're clearly concerned

1080
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,760
with the overall health of the the

1081
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,720
series

1082
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,560
uh since if this the series is not

1083
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,400
healthy then obviously their stream is

1084
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,520
not healthy

1085
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,560
uh and it impacts their stream

1086
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,319
uh and i understand why they would take

1087
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,960
advice from a professional uh publishing

1088
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,680
experts

1089
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,160
um i i'm not understanding what would be

1090
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,880
the rationale for the publishing expert

1091
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,319
to have um you know have a vote on this

1092
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,599
uh this approvals

1093
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,200
board um you know that

1094
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,720
you know clearly they're they're an

1095
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,000
advisor and then clearly they're an

1096
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
important advisor but i don't understand

1097
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,160
the

1098
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,440
the where they get the legitimacy to

1099
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,480
have the vote from

1100
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,839
um i'm going to ask those people who

1101
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,920
want to answer to colin on that point to

1102
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,160
get in the queue behind

1103
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,520
mike just to make sure that that in

1104
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,720
that question does get touched upon

1105
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,640
because i think a number of people have

1106
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,119
it

1107
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,800
uh ecker yeah so

1108
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,839
um i i guess i i sort of wanted to

1109
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:54,400
respond

1110
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,920
to a point that was made earlier which

1111
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,319
is how i think by adrian how did these

1112
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,000
points get raised i think

1113
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,400
adrian asked and i think that that

1114
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,160
that's the critical distinction between

1115
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,640
i think my view and perhaps joel's view

1116
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
so i think it's worth uh you know we're

1117
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,280
trying to flesh out a little bit

1118
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,839
which is um i think it is important

1119
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,440
those points get raised and i think that

1120
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,200
um you know we need a structure to

1121
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,480
ensure that they do get raised and i

1122
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,920
think that like a reasonable

1123
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,119
expectation is the the advisor will

1124
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,640
raise will be responsible for raising

1125
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,400
them um i think the question

1126
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,079
fundamental question is who has the

1127
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,000
final say and

1128
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,960
um so i think it's important to think

1129
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,480
language meaning has a between the

1130
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,839
ability to raise points

1131
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,800
um and the ability to actually um block

1132
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,079
the work going forward

1133
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,079
and so it's only that that i object to

1134
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,440
in terms of having the

1135
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,280
advisor have a vote not um i'm certainly

1136
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,480
quite comfortable with a pile of

1137
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,000
different mechanisms to ensure that

1138
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,040
their points are

1139
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,359
raised and heard as long as the as long

1140
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,720
as the communities the people

1141
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,160
responsible for making ultimate decision

1142
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,280
which i think is consistent with the

1143
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,520
kind of like kind of quasi democracy we

1144
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,720
run here

1145
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,880
uh ecker stay with me for just a moment

1146
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,079
um

1147
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,200
the uh this this relates to

1148
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,400
the previous slide in which we put a pin

1149
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,240
in um does joel's increasing the

1150
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,000
number necessary to um

1151
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,119
uh to to uh block

1152
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,640
or to to con to send a concern back

1153
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,880
does does that help ameliorate your

1154
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,359
concerns

1155
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,079
um i i guess i think here's a here's a

1156
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,200
situation where it's maybe

1157
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,720
maybe difficult to distinguish between

1158
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,280
formal and and and practical concerns

1159
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,440
um as a practical matter if you um

1160
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,640
required

1161
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,079
two board members to um to block um

1162
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,359
uh um you know then you will be in the

1163
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,560
same situations if you have a simple

1164
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,240
majority with a current

1165
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,000
four-person board so i guess maybe that

1166
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,680
doesn't matter um but you know we don't

1167
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,720
know that the board will be constant

1168
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,280
size

1169
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,040
um and i also think it frankly just

1170
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,640
think it sends the wrong message so

1171
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,400
um you know i thought about this a bit

1172
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,079
and i'm not as like

1173
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,319
perhaps strongly opposed as i was to the

1174
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,079
proposal um but i still think it'd be

1175
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,359
like substantially better to

1176
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,960
set the right expectations which is that

1177
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,319
people who have equities vote and people

1178
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,839
do not have equities should not vote so

1179
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,119
i'm not ready to decide on that proposal

1180
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,119
at this point

1181
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,800
thank you uh mike yeah i really wish we

1182
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,560
talked about how large the body was

1183
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,040
first

1184
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,319
rather than this particular rat hole

1185
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,520
we've gotten down into

1186
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,000
um and i'm actually going to start in

1187
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,160
that space

1188
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,160
if the if the rsc is only one vote on

1189
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,480
a board of five then yeah maybe there's

1190
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,680
a problem i don't know

1191
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,440
i don't actually think there is the

1192
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,440
receives one vote on the board of eight

1193
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,119
where we include the stream members and

1194
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,280
we and we bring in

1195
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,520
some longer term members via the non-com

1196
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,480
um that doesn't become much as much of a

1197
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,520
problem

1198
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,160
there's also the question we're still in

1199
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,440
this

1200
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,960
this mode that that is loving

1201
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,280
the consensus of the board as opposed to

1202
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
a vote of the board

1203
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,119
and we should probably stop thinking

1204
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,079
about that

1205
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,200
um and and actually just say you know if

1206
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,280
if five members of the board approve the

1207
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,440
thing on any member board or

1208
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,800
four members are proven on a seven

1209
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,040
member board it goes forward

1210
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,480
you know or something along those lines

1211
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,000
near yeah and ecker unless um you want

1212
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,280
to speak again maybe um

1213
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,640
take your hand down please

1214
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,400
yeah so i'm i'm really not sure how this

1215
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,119
practical

1216
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,000
could work to put the rsa or whatever

1217
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,599
this is called on the board

1218
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,400
because um we will likely will hire

1219
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,760
somebody who is like

1220
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,520
not from our community yet because we

1221
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,680
want expertise on publishing which is

1222
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,040
not really what we have in this

1223
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,079
community

1224
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,760
and for a person who comes from the

1225
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,079
outside it takes a while a year or two

1226
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,839
to actually understand how our community

1227
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,720
works

1228
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,640
and then this is kind of getting a

1229
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,240
long-term commitment right if we have

1230
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,760
somebody there who like

1231
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,520
had take two years to understand what's

1232
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,440
going on we want to really keep that

1233
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,119
person we cannot just like exchange this

1234
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,040
person very quickly

1235
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,119
so with that sense with the idea that we

1236
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,319
actually want to have

1237
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,920
outside expertise that we can consult

1238
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,319
and that we can be more flexible than we

1239
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,160
have been and not putting ourselves into

1240
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,680
like this little corner that we have

1241
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,480
been in

1242
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,079
i don't think it's a good idea to put

1243
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,839
this person on the board with a bottled

1244
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
position

1245
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,270
okay uh thank you miriah um

1246
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,000
[Music]

1247
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,160
mike you want to take uh it looks like

1248
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,839
thus far you might have the last word on

1249
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,680
this but for the moment you want to say

1250
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,079
that

1251
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,079
you want to go ahead and take them yeah

1252
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,000
typing into hang on can you hear me

1253
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,920
yeah okay it's complaining you can't see

1254
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,839
i can't see audio um

1255
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,640
one of the things with respect to the

1256
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,960
board as currently constituted here is

1257
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,800
the iaed appoints three of the four

1258
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,040
members

1259
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,480
directly or indirectly um so

1260
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,200
i would like to have some balance that's

1261
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,919
not iab

1262
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,280
overrideable if you will in some ways

1263
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,800
now i'm not saying they will

1264
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,240
but you need a balance

1265
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,280
in that particular model to what we've

1266
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,640
currently got i'm not worried about the

1267
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,400
rsa i'm actually worried about

1268
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,440
the the three guys the rs

1269
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,800
appointed by the um iab the independent

1270
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,520
series guy

1271
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,119
and and the uh research folks

1272
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,280
so

1273
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,599
okay um i think uh at least for the

1274
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:50,319
moment

1275
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,520
everybody has had their say

1276
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:56,800
on where we stand between

1277
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,319
um uh whether this person has a vote or

1278
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,920
not

1279
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,520
um as i understand there there are a

1280
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,119
couple i'm just going to recapitulate a

1281
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,559
couple of issues

1282
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,839
um so that we're clear on uh

1283
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,440
people's positions there's a uh

1284
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,040
one concern that has been raised which

1285
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,319
is that the r the roca doesn't

1286
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,640
directly represent a particular

1287
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,760
constituency

1288
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,200
now that is disputed at least

1289
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,480
at some level um in in the notion that

1290
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,359
the rcaea has to represent

1291
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,559
the readership um

1292
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,240
and so that that's one aspect of the

1293
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,440
um of the

1294
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,880
disagreement if you will um the the

1295
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,400
second uh

1296
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,760
area where um we've heard i think

1297
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,880
a little bit of disagreement is

1298
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,960
um do the or should there be more people

1299
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,680
other than just the stream heads and or

1300
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,079
this other

1301
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,520
person um as mike just spoke and i spoke

1302
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,119
to that point

1303
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,480
um the third point that was raised

1304
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,800
was um what's the the voting process

1305
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,359
um should you know the discussion of

1306
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,040
consensus versus

1307
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,720
um vote i think also came up

1308
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,920
now in my

1309
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,040
in my understanding at this point these

1310
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,160
are basically the same

1311
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,960
issues that have come up again and again

1312
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,760
so we are

1313
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,119
i think a little bit in a jam

1314
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,359
uh on this point and uh i think that

1315
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:43,520
brian and i have been sort of chatting

1316
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,880
in the background as to whether we

1317
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,839
should pull on this

1318
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,240
issue assuming one of us can figure out

1319
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,559
how to use the polling tool

1320
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,280
and maybe it's probably a good idea to

1321
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,480
get a hum

1322
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,680
along these lines i have somewhat been

1323
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,400
averse to trying to do that with the

1324
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,760
hope that we would find

1325
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,319
solutions that people would be um

1326
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,440
shall we say least unhappy

1327
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,880
by um so um

1328
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,520
but it maybe we do need at least a sense

1329
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,160
of the room

1330
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,920
brian do you want to comment a little

1331
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,480
bit on this do you have thoughts

1332
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,920
uh well i i i would like to see

1333
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,079
where we are we we haven't tried running

1334
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,079
poles to see where we are and we may be

1335
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,839
all over the we may be

1336
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,160
um uh you know 50 50 70 30 90 10

1337
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,400
who knows and i think i'd like to see

1338
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,440
where we are

1339
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,960
i think the only question is is there

1340
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,200
one question

1341
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,559
is the rsea a voting member of the board

1342
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,520
or do you want to do

1343
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,720
are they a member of the board and

1344
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,200
non-voting as separate issues

1345
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,160
um leaving off the are there more people

1346
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,920
on the board and how many votes does it

1347
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,640
take

1348
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,400
for another question i think this

1349
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,720
fundamental issue of do they vote

1350
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,720
is that is the thing that i want to

1351
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,640
understand where the work group is

1352
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,440
we clearly have some people want it and

1353
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,960
some people who don't

1354
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,400
and i think for this vote

1355
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,559
um brian i think we should probably do

1356
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:13,680
two polls

1357
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,720
um one is where it's

1358
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,800
you know one plus you know the person

1359
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,400
who made the first concern

1360
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,520
and then the you know along along with

1361
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,160
one other

1362
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,119
and then the second is what what joel

1363
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:27,520
also

1364
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,040
suggested which is the person who made

1365
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,559
this concern plus

1366
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,760
two others and to see if either

1367
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,480
if that makes a substantial difference

1368
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,240
in people's thoughts

1369
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,160
so um brian do you want to try and

1370
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,520
arrange the poll

1371
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,839
yeah i've got i've got it uh wes wanted

1372
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,119
to speak

1373
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,240
okay yeah so

1374
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,880
i i think running a poll is a good idea

1375
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,280
the thing that i am concerned with is

1376
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,359
that there seems to be a fundamental

1377
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,440
larger issue that is being danced around

1378
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,359
with all the questions that

1379
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,280
mike in particular has pointed out right

1380
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,880
which is

1381
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,119
uh whether or not this particular

1382
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,079
individual

1383
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,680
is on the board is a sub question to the

1384
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,119
larger question i don't know how to

1385
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:12,880
phrase which is

1386
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,440
what is the balance of power makeup need

1387
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:15,920
to be

1388
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,400
within the larger structure of the board

1389
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,040
in order

1390
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,040
so that there is fairness represented

1391
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,559
across the board so mike you know

1392
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:23,520
brought up the concern

1393
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,440
that if three of the members are

1394
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,559
appointed by the iab

1395
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,119
then that gives the ieb too much power

1396
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,000
and so i don't

1397
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,920
really know how to even phrase the

1398
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,040
problem space

1399
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,240
of what you know what should the what

1400
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:36,640
should

1401
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,960
the uh the power structure be so that

1402
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,880
nobody has power

1403
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,400
and so whether or not this particular

1404
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,160
person is on it you know it

1405
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,040
that that question may be subservient to

1406
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,160
a bigger issue

1407
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,880
we can back up to just ask the question

1408
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,640
you know it does seem to me

1409
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,559
that there is there are not

1410
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,760
that that the people who want

1411
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,760
the person to be a voting member

1412
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,720
are have varying opinions about how many

1413
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,079
you know how overrideable

1414
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,119
that vote is but

1415
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,800
that's the fundamental issue for them

1416
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,319
they've got to vote

1417
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,200
and the on that and and there are there

1418
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,440
is definitely a group of people who say

1419
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,720
no they don't represent a stream

1420
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,200
they're hired hand they don't get a vote

1421
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,359
and that that's the fundamental issue

1422
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,079
and all the other issues how many votes

1423
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,400
it takes to override

1424
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,079
who else is on the board are are are

1425
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,839
independent of that the do they get a

1426
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,079
it may be that there are people who say

1427
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,760
well i'll let them have a vote if they

1428
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,079
if

1429
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,319
if you know if they can be buried by the

1430
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:53,920
other guys

1431
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,520
if that's true if there are people who

1432
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,359
say well yeah that's okay if there are

1433
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,520
if they have a vote as long as they have

1434
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,359
a really small vote

1435
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,680
um

1436
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,720
i think is the issue i think in all

1437
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,520
joel's

1438
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,480
point was that that that there is no

1439
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,200
blocker

1440
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,680
no one can block it it takes at least

1441
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,440
one other person to do

1442
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,640
and i think we've all agreed to that

1443
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,960
um i don't hear anybody objecting to

1444
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,079
that so

1445
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,200
no one gets a block including the

1446
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,839
rsa e whatever it is if we if we say it

1447
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:36,078
um so

1448
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,200
i i i don't know if people want to speak

1449
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:39,920
to this

1450
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,480
i'm still trying to make sure that we

1451
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,040
don't

1452
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,280
have a bazillion choices and that we get

1453
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,280
to the heart of the matter as quickly as

1454
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,119
as possible and and just to add i think

1455
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:51,520
that

1456
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,040
different people may have different

1457
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,040
views as to what the heart of the matter

1458
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,920
is

1459
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,359
right um so uh why don't we at least

1460
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,720
start with um

1461
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,160
the the question and let me see if i can

1462
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,000
just phrase this right is

1463
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
how many people are comfortable with

1464
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,839
um this

1465
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,839
what if we just take this proposal as it

1466
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:20,000
stands

1467
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,119
the you know the with the four

1468
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,079
uh with the four stream handheads and

1469
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,200
the paid professional

1470
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,920
publishing expert one is that where you

1471
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,200
want to start brian

1472
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,760
i just i just thought the question the

1473
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,359
rfca a voting member of the board

1474
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,559
why do we start with that so

1475
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,799
if you can figure out the the polling

1476
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,040
tool

1477
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,400
so there is a there's a poll

1478
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,640
there's an rsca voting member of the of

1479
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,760
the board

1480
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,200
please vote well raise your hands it's

1481
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,160
not a vote

1482
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,000
uh typically go to the show of hands

1483
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,680
tool in the upper right to be clear if

1484
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,880
you're if you're vote if you're do not

1485
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,319
raising hands or voting no right

1486
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:17,839
uh yes

1487
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:36,699
[Applause]

1488
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,920
there's yeah please please uh

1489
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,680
we would really like to get a sense of

1490
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,920
where the work group is we

1491
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,599
you know if if we really are

1492
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,119
50 50 ish in the middle we have a lot

1493
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:53,520
more

1494
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,920
work to reach consensus if it's if it

1495
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,599
really is a small number of people on

1496
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,960
one side and a very large number of

1497
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,640
people on the other side

1498
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,880
then you know we have rest consensus

1499
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,799
we're trying to do this

1500
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:07,920
um so i'd appreciate it if there are 45

1501
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,760
participants 17 have

1502
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,319
have have expressed an opinion i would

1503
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:13,920
really appreciate if you

1504
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,119
if you put something up there

1505
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:22,960
wait uh just another 30 seconds for

1506
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:25,200
people to consider yes

1507
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,480
and then i think we have to to move on

1508
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,960
please uh if you haven't expressed a

1509
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:41,839
view please do so at this point

1510
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,720
all right just another few moments here

1511
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,599
last call if you if you want to vote uh

1512
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:56,880
if you want to raise your hand or not

1513
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,240
raise your hand

1514
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,280
please do so now yeah we've had we have

1515
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,160
roughly half

1516
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,319
half the people half the participants

1517
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:05,680
haven't expressed an opinion

1518
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,440
the other half have not okay um

1519
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,960
that could be because they're between

1520
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,280
sessions um

1521
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,119
all right all right about how i

1522
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,960
believe that this the voting tool is

1523
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,480
supposed to work right in the same way

1524
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,240
that you do hums because you don't know

1525
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,400
if everybody is going to vote

1526
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,280
you have to do the positive and negative

1527
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,119
sides of the questions as two separate

1528
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:29,599
votes

1529
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:30,880
you have to do a raise your hand if you

1530
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,640
want them to be and then put that down

1531
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,200
and then

1532
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,079
do if you just specifically don't want

1533
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,520
them to be a voting member then do the

1534
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,000
opposite

1535
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,280
i'm going to do that okay

1536
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,400
let's go ahead and well i i think martin

1537
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:44,799
has

1538
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,760
the point right we don't have a rough

1539
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,720
consensus

1540
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,160
we we have we have a a significant

1541
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,440
number

1542
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,240
you can see by the current i'll i'll go

1543
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,400
the other way just to see what happens

1544
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,480
um let's let's do that let's let's we'll

1545
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,160
go the other way we'll i'll i'll flip

1546
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,280
the uh

1547
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,440
the the question around um

1548
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,200
so for those who aren't seeing it it

1549
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,480
would the there were

1550
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,319
44 participants that are available

1551
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,760
according to the tool

1552
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,079
15 raised their hand and eight did not

1553
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,559
do not raise him so you're gonna do the

1554
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,000
next one then uh

1555
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,400
brian

1556
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,359
i'm i'm gonna do that the other way

1557
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,799
should it not have a vote

1558
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,440
so then you can that that just makes

1559
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,720
sure that we know what's going on

1560
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,720
r-s-e-a i'm gonna use the consistent

1561
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:45,280
and i'll start it again so now now a

1562
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,400
raise hand is a is a is a no they

1563
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,280
shouldn't have a vote

1564
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,920
so here's the real test is if we get

1565
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,799
different results

1566
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:01,839
okay

1567
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:04,969
[Applause]

1568
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,960
so hopefully if you voted the last time

1569
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,799
you'll vote this time

1570
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:14,880
please yeah yeah just

1571
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,359
we'd like to see the same result the

1572
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,000
other way

1573
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,760
just so that we know we're what we're

1574
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,839
seeing

1575
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:35,680
yeah okay

1576
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,559
give it a couple more seconds please

1577
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,839
express your opinion

1578
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,559
last call anybody uh

1579
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,240
hasn't voted please do so now

1580
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,359
okay

1581
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,520
let's uh you know it's it's not the same

1582
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,079
but it's it's close enough we

1583
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,440
we understand where we are um

1584
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,240
all right i'm going to end the session

1585
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:16,720
so

1586
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,400
what are the two what are the two raised

1587
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,040
hands ah thank you

1588
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,799
okay um

1589
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,880
one was thirteen to nine the other was

1590
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,319
fifteen to eight

1591
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,359
you know it's okay

1592
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,680
um

1593
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,280
so what do you wanna do at this point

1594
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:37,839
you want to

1595
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:40,559
want to ask more questions or or keep

1596
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:41,839
working

1597
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,760
we don't have rough consensus that's

1598
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,880
pretty clear

1599
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,240
but it's also clear that more there are

1600
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,599
more people who want

1601
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,799
a vote voting member than not so we

1602
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,520
perhaps following the discussion should

1603
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,039
be talking about

1604
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,079
the question of who's on the board and

1605
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:01,760
the question of

1606
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,839
how many how many votes does it take to

1607
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,839
override

1608
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,359
a concern i mean i think

1609
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,359
we really have to to get over this hump

1610
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,440
and we maybe we haven't been imaginative

1611
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,440
enough in in in our approaches here

1612
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,330
um but um

1613
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:22,799
[Music]

1614
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,960
i guess what i i would ask for a little

1615
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,079
bit of discussion

1616
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,440
in terms of particularly let's start

1617
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,079
with the people who would prefer the

1618
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:32,960
rsea

1619
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,799
not have a vote for those people who

1620
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,280
voted in that direction

1621
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,920
the question i have to ask you is what

1622
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,559
would make you comfortable

1623
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,720
what would make it at least acceptable

1624
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,359
for the rsca to have a vote what under

1625
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,200
what circumstances

1626
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,480
would that be um okay uh

1627
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,839
or at least painful or at least at least

1628
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:00,960
undesirable in terms of effects

1629
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,319
martin and mark

1630
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:08,559
right so the thing that i was thinking

1631
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:09,760
about this was

1632
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,960
um this person doesn't have any

1633
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,720
constituency so um we would need to have

1634
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,920
a system of

1635
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,640
checks and balances in place essentially

1636
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,240
they would need to be answerable to some

1637
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,079
community or some group

1638
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,640
in order to be confident that those

1639
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,640
votes were not

1640
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,960
individually motivated or any of the

1641
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,640
other sort of failure modes that we

1642
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,920
might imagine

1643
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,520
and as i'm seeing you continue to use

1644
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,079
the word vote

1645
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,119
which distresses me still

1646
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,039
i i think that the um the reason that

1647
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,680
i'm against this as well is that vote

1648
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,119
means block

1649
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,760
um even though you can't do it alone you

1650
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,880
have the power

1651
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,160
to to block uh approvals which

1652
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,240
reflect the consensus of the community

1653
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,680
and

1654
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,680
that's that's a whitey responsibility

1655
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,839
mark

1656
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,880
hello

1657
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:28,799
yes no yeah we can hear

1658
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,839
this is really weird um

1659
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:36,480
so i i i agree with martin that that

1660
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,000
we need to have a discussion about

1661
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,400
what the constraints on this person are

1662
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,960
you know what how how we can give them

1663
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,280
some form of concrete oversight as

1664
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,119
discussed and that would give me a lot

1665
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,400
of comfort about them being on this

1666
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,200
board

1667
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,000
i think also if we change it so that two

1668
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,480
or

1669
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,920
some other larger than one number of

1670
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,559
participants the board are required to

1671
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:02,240
truly block something

1672
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,000
um would also give me a lot of comfort

1673
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
about this person being on the board

1674
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,200
um i i think those are the two obvious

1675
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:09,680
things

1676
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,359
in front of us i understand the

1677
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,599
arguments for for the people are making

1678
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,680
as to why this person needs to be aboard

1679
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,760
i don't have a strong fundamental

1680
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,119
objection to them on the board i just

1681
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,839
think that we need to think through

1682
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,359
uh as has been said so many times the

1683
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,359
pig and chicken kind of nature here that

1684
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,559
one of these people has not left the

1685
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,880
other um that's why i voted no

1686
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,359
and i'd happily vote yes to have this

1687
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,160
person the board

1688
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:37,359
if we had those discussions

1689
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,759
becker

1690
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,640
yeah so i think i'm somewhere between

1691
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,000
martin and mark they're probably more

1692
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,200
towards martin namely i think there's a

1693
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,559
fundamental legitimacy question here

1694
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,520
that makes me pretty uncomfortable with

1695
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,359
it no matter how the voting is done

1696
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:52,720
um um but um certainly i'd be more

1697
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,520
comfortable with it

1698
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,839
if basically the power was substantially

1699
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:56,799
eluded what

1700
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,920
what i'm most concerned with is that the

1701
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,039
communities decisions are the ones that

1702
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:02,960
get enacted and that someone who's who

1703
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:03,280
is

1704
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,400
wall member of the community not a

1705
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,760
representative of the community does not

1706
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,640
get to stop this

1707
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,039
position being enacted and so um

1708
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,079
and so i think that that's the

1709
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,359
fundamental conservation any case and i

1710
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,559
think it's important distinguish again

1711
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:15,599
between

1712
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:16,720
represent representative of the

1713
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,880
community a member of the community and

1714
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,079
on the the stream the stream

1715
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,240
um uh managers or representatives

1716
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,200
community as well as members of the

1717
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,319
community whereas the

1718
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,079
um whereas because the weight is

1719
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,240
selected the advisor is only a member of

1720
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,520
the community

1721
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,480
eric given given the number of people

1722
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,160
who think that they ought to be a voting

1723
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,640
member

1724
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,839
is there some way that you can

1725
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:45,200
see to get your concerns addressed

1726
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:49,680
that is that let lets the

1727
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,359
the rsa be a voting member

1728
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,079
or is it just fundamentally not possible

1729
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:56,880
in your mind

1730
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,319
for that to be found i mean if they have

1731
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,079
one vote and everybody else is 100

1732
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,599
i mean you know um i i mean

1733
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,480
more importantly like that i mean my my

1734
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,839
point is that like well i'm trying to

1735
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,039
avoid the situation in which they're

1736
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,400
deciding exciting question on an

1737
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,440
important issue whether or not we go

1738
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,160
forward

1739
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,839
and i think that's think that is not the

1740
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:14,960
key question that people are concerned

1741
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:15,440
about

1742
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,880
if people think it's symbolic then sure

1743
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,160
let's quick start situation when someone

1744
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,240
symbolic

1745
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,720
no i'm i'm looking for compromise you're

1746
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,480
you're

1747
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,280
i'm trying to get you so i want to so i

1748
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,240
want to step back i want to

1749
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,920
i reject the premise that because we

1750
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,119
have marginally more people in this

1751
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:32,720
particular meeting in favor of

1752
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,720
a versus b that that means the people

1753
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,319
who in favor of b need to compromise

1754
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,760
i do not agree with that so um so like

1755
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,880
if you're planning to ask them the same

1756
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,079
question then i'm like i'm for it but if

1757
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,520
you're just if you're if what you're

1758
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,880
saying is like we have more

1759
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,559
people this particular tally like a

1760
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,000
versus b then that's just not the right

1761
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,680
way to proceed

1762
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,919
okay

1763
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:57,200
okay um i'm happy to ask the question

1764
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,799
the other way around

1765
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:01,520
um but before we do let's go to mike and

1766
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,480
then

1767
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,200
um and then we'll do that yeah i just

1768
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,599
wanted to i just wanted to clarify

1769
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:11,680
what ecker was saying um

1770
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,160
and he was talking about one specific

1771
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,119
one specific

1772
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:17,439
uh meeting and i think the votes on

1773
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,359
these things are just basically

1774
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,198
the votes on these things they're going

1775
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,600
to they you know until the person

1776
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,520
until they get to it's not going to be a

1777
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:26,960
meeting based vote

1778
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,359
but a process based vote so i don't know

1779
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,040
how that applies and i may have missed

1780
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:31,839
something i

1781
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:38,319
i had to run out grab some water

1782
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,679
this had to do with the poll that we

1783
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,000
just took i think yeah

1784
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,040
and so let me let me turn it around and

1785
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,640
say for those

1786
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,359
who would really want the person to be a

1787
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,399
board member

1788
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:52,799
the the rsa to be a board member what

1789
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:54,799
would make you comfortable

1790
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:57,920
uh in that person not being a board

1791
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,719
member

1792
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:02,799
there is there anything that um is there

1793
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,158
are there uh

1794
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:07,359
are there approaches that could be

1795
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,439
applied that that would

1796
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,759
um make you comfortable with the person

1797
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:12,960
not being a board member

1798
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:21,839
anybody like to take the floor on that

1799
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,359
okay so um

1800
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:31,600
i'm not seeing really anybody willing to

1801
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,960
take the floor on that this

1802
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,560
uh puts the chairs in a difficult

1803
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,238
position okay

1804
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,000
uh all right john and then bron

1805
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,679
yeah i i think this comes back to uh

1806
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,640
to one of those age-old at this point

1807
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,479
fundamental discussions

1808
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,520
uh a board which represents

1809
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,440
only the streams is not representing the

1810
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,080
user community in representing the

1811
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,400
broader interests and stability of the

1812
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,280
series

1813
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,719
it's representing the interest of the

1814
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,000
streams and no matter how you

1815
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,760
couch the responsibilities of those

1816
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,560
stream members to that broader view

1817
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,840
it really doesn't change anything uh so

1818
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,199
uh having the

1819
01:10:18,199 --> 01:10:21,360
rsea um

1820
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,880
be a member of the board but not voting

1821
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,080
but who cannot be excluded from meetings

1822
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:32,159
um maybe uh having a

1823
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:35,440
board which is larger

1824
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,120
to somehow represent the community

1825
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,600
better than maybe

1826
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:44,800
uh but uh but the situation where uh

1827
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,000
uh where the uh where the streams can

1828
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,320
the streams or or even just the three

1829
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,480
people appointed by the iab

1830
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,760
uh can get together and say whatever it

1831
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,159
is that the publication's interest

1832
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,239
and the broader community interest is

1833
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:01,280
doesn't count

1834
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,000
because we want it the way we want it

1835
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,120
within the

1836
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,920
ietf community but that the broader

1837
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,360
reader and user

1838
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,320
and procurement communities uh doesn't

1839
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:12,880
work

1840
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,920
and uh and as i say that's that's one of

1841
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,159
those fundamental arguments which in

1842
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:21,280
a variety of different forms has uh has

1843
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,960
been going on not only since this group

1844
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,560
was constituted

1845
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,679
but uh but is ultimately the source of

1846
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:30,960
the problem that got us here

1847
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,960
i say very similar things to what john

1848
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,400
said there um

1849
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,159
but also i mean there's two things one

1850
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,480
of which is the diversity of the people

1851
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,000
on the board

1852
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,440
and and the views and this person's

1853
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,880
going to be fairly intimately involved

1854
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,640
in what's going on on the board

1855
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,400
so having them have a say rather than

1856
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,080
sit in meetings and having no say

1857
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,360
most of the time it won't make much

1858
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,360
difference um unless we're going purely

1859
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,800
consensus decision making and all of

1860
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,120
this it's going to be a case where

1861
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,120
they're only having a voice but at least

1862
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,880
they have a voice i think

1863
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,320
being in this situation and not having a

1864
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,600
voice at all would be much more

1865
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,600
difficult

1866
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,760
would i be happy the other way around if

1867
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,600
we can get a good person who's happy

1868
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,239
living like that then yes but i think

1869
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:16,719
it's

1870
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:18,480
it's a position with a lot of

1871
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,080
responsibility and giving that

1872
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,000
responsibility without any voice is

1873
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:22,719
going to be

1874
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:24,080
uncomfortable for the person in that

1875
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,480
position and i don't see the strength of

1876
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,640
the argument against it really

1877
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,040
all unless there's a half the streams

1878
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,480
are going one way half the streams are

1879
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:33,679
going the other way

1880
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,320
they're still not going to be out voted

1881
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,239
but at least the editor gets to gets to

1882
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:39,440
state their case and

1883
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:43,199
and put their position down

1884
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,080
and thank you for turning on your camera

1885
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:49,280
it's nice to see you

1886
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,920
and then colin

1887
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,280
hi yeah i i'm quite sure that we're all

1888
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:59,199
on the same page with what

1889
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:02,800
the the role of the rsea is

1890
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,480
and that might be part of this i mean

1891
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,320
the the previous comment that

1892
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,840
they have a lot you know it's a position

1893
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:10,159
with a lot of responsibility

1894
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:13,679
um is it or is it a a relatively small

1895
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,159
role

1896
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:16,880
giving advice on uh technical publishing

1897
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,000
aspects uh

1898
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,320
and that might be part of the uh the

1899
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,280
confusion here

1900
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,120
and part of the disagreement we

1901
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,120
actually came to some amount of

1902
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:28,640
consensus

1903
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,360
on the role of the rsca and if you look

1904
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,080
in the issue

1905
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,000
tracker i think you'll find some text

1906
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,440
around that

1907
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,040
let me just see if i can bring that up

1908
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,960
one of the things while i'm doing that

1909
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,960
that i wanted to mention

1910
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,080
was that um

1911
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,320
the uh issue tracker

1912
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,600
and actually the home of the the

1913
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,960
um of the program on github

1914
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,440
has changed its name it's now before

1915
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,159
it's now the

1916
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:03,760
in into archboard stroke um program

1917
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,880
dash rfc dash future this happened

1918
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,679
though this past

1919
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,760
week and um

1920
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,760
there's a let's see here

1921
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,800
yeah there's a redirect so the right

1922
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,560
things should happen

1923
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,679
and um i believe if we look at

1924
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,280
issue number 12.

1925
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,679
all right um let me just see if i can

1926
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:32,320
find that

1927
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:38,000
just a moment this is the one

1928
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,760
all right this this is the one that the

1929
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,679
text is actually linked into another

1930
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,679
github document and let me just see if i

1931
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,400
can manage to share that

1932
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,639
just

1933
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,760
having a moment with firefox here

1934
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,520
back to this and then click on

1935
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,000
this all right

1936
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,840
i'm hitting the wrong button

1937
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,480
this here

1938
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:28,879
so here's what we agreed on actually

1939
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,840
just that people have that in their mind

1940
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,960
one thing we didn't agree on by the way

1941
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,719
was the name uh that

1942
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,000
that's something that's not agreed

1943
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,719
but this was uh we did agree on this

1944
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,840
some time ago

1945
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,040
okay let me come back if people

1946
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,960
are happy with it or have seen this you

1947
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:06,080
can find it yourself

1948
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,440
off the off the github page which is

1949
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,159
linked into

1950
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:13,280
our charter let me go back and now

1951
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,719
um continue to share

1952
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:21,840
joel's slides

1953
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:28,719
so by my measure

1954
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,760
um you know

1955
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,440
we had a we had one poll

1956
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,678
um

1957
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,040
let me ask a different question

1958
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,440
if we did given what you just saw number

1959
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,960
one

1960
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,960
if we assume that there is a

1961
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:56,159
um let me restate this

1962
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:59,679
what what i'm wondering is

1963
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:03,760
uh assuming that the rsea

1964
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,560
is in fact responsible for this this

1965
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,760
group of reader

1966
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:11,199
leadership that john and joel

1967
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:14,640
and adrian and others have

1968
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,840
uh mentioned

1969
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,360
would adding some appointments say from

1970
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,560
isoc

1971
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,840
make a difference to people particularly

1972
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,719
people who didn't

1973
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,320
want the uh the

1974
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,360
person on the board and um let's see

1975
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:35,920
here i think

1976
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,280
miriah you're you're trying to get a

1977
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,679
word in

1978
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,520
yeah i put my hand up when you still

1979
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,520
showed the description of the

1980
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:48,480
rsa and i think like the underlying

1981
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,560
assumption i was making was that like

1982
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,320
for this position we are looking for an

1983
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,000
external expert

1984
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,719
um and when we hire this person this

1985
01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:57,520
person might

1986
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,600
like not really know our community so at

1987
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,960
the point where we hire this person that

1988
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,640
this person is not really a community

1989
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,080
member yet

1990
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,800
um and i think it takes a while until

1991
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,400
this person can understand what's

1992
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,320
happening in the community

1993
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,000
so that's my assumption and i believe

1994
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,600
that other people it's even

1995
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,080
that we hire a person who already is a

1996
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,040
community member

1997
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,360
and knows how the community works and

1998
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,719
that's a big difference for me and

1999
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,880
that's not anything that the text says

2000
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,040
but i believe that's like we're um kind

2001
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,400
of talking past each other a little bit

2002
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,760
um so multiple issues of course on the

2003
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:32,800
table in area

2004
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,080
um one

2005
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,800
question i would ask you is how would

2006
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,440
you view

2007
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:43,280
this person say vis-a-vis

2008
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,719
another board where you have external

2009
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:48,640
members come on to the board

2010
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,800
we have the most corporations have

2011
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,320
external members

2012
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,159
come in how would you view that as

2013
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,239
different or the same or

2014
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:59,839
what would you see the comparison as

2015
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,320
so i think we have on the lsd we have

2016
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,360
actually people who are

2017
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,600
like coming more from the outside just

2018
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,800
learning our community

2019
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,280
um but you know there's also this very

2020
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:10,960
specific expertise and they're not kind

2021
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,800
of voting on documents they're not kind

2022
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,560
of voting on changing our process

2023
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,640
they're very much mined but the process

2024
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,159
um the process they can do bind on what

2025
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:22,560
community consensus is and here we're

2026
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,320
having a body where you actually kind of

2027
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,159
can block community consensus so that's

2028
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:29,199
a huge difference for me

2029
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,760
okay um and and i want to say one more

2030
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,880
thing um

2031
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,640
the the reason why i had this assumption

2032
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,159
that we would hire somebody who is kind

2033
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,679
of a little bit on the outside is also

2034
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,280
because i don't want us to get in this

2035
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,719
position again where we have like this

2036
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:42,560
one specific person which has like all

2037
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,520
the skills

2038
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,679
we need and then when this person person

2039
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,600
leaves for whatever reason

2040
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,880
we're in this situation again we're

2041
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,560
completely lost right i wanted want to

2042
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,159
make it much more easier

2043
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,239
to find people to help us in this

2044
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:56,960
position and then also if needed to

2045
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,360
you know make it easier to find somebody

2046
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,280
new

2047
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,960
let me ask a different question in

2048
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,480
response to that

2049
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,920
would having sort of a deputy

2050
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,679
or or somebody who might be the um

2051
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:13,920
you know a natural successor on board

2052
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,840
would that alleviate that sort of a

2053
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,040
concern

2054
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:23,199
um not quite sure what you mean but like

2055
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:24,400
i think it's the same i don't want to

2056
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,000
make this position dependent on like a

2057
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,600
very small set of people i really want

2058
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,239
to have a

2059
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,080
bigger set of people that we can fill

2060
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,040
this position with

2061
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,719
okay uh colin

2062
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:40,320
uh yeah um i mean yeah i think miriam

2063
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,080
said a lot of things i would agree with

2064
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,080
i think coming back to the question you

2065
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,239
you

2066
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,600
assuming this person was representing

2067
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,800
the community

2068
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:53,600
the the broader um community the broader

2069
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:54,320
readership

2070
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,960
and so on but that doesn't seem to be

2071
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,080
the role which is in the github issue so

2072
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,280
we seem to be

2073
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,280
again we seem to be circling around what

2074
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,560
what this

2075
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,719
what the role of this person is and i'm

2076
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:08,560
still not convinced we're all on

2077
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:15,840
the same page about that

2078
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,719
comments conflated things in a way that

2079
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:25,520
is

2080
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,719
really confusing for me yes i

2081
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,480
expect we will have to go outside the

2082
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:31,920
community to get

2083
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,360
a suitable expert as the rsa

2084
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:37,280
yes that means they will need to learn

2085
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,400
about the

2086
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,960
community but i also assume they are

2087
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,719
professionals and will not stick their

2088
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,080
r in on well the community needs x or y

2089
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,920
until they've actually gotten up to

2090
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,840
speed on the community

2091
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:53,600
that's not how professionals work

2092
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,040
so i i have trouble with your concern

2093
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,639
that they should not have a vote because

2094
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:00,080
at the first part they won't know the

2095
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,760
community

2096
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,000
if we hire a skilled professional who is

2097
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,440
appropriate to hire

2098
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,199
they won't be making statements that are

2099
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,199
not grounded when they don't have the

2100
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,360
information that's part of being a

2101
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,000
professional

2102
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,600
let me reply very quickly i think this

2103
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,440
is like hopefully that's true

2104
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,840
but i wouldn't just like bet on it

2105
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,520
that's not the design not the system i

2106
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,840
want to design around

2107
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,159
worst case i've said if they can't

2108
01:22:28,159 --> 01:22:30,080
persuade at least one other stream head

2109
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,280
of their point of view then they get

2110
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,800
overridden and they haven't done any

2111
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,800
damage

2112
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:39,840
if they're really out in left field

2113
01:22:41,199 --> 01:22:42,400
yeah that's that's actually another

2114
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,760
thing i'm not i'm not that's something

2115
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,280
we should discuss i'm not convinced that

2116
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,360
this overriding structure

2117
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,760
uh is a good thing i mean probably you

2118
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,639
need this in a as a corner case in a

2119
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:54,159
very spare case but hopefully that's not

2120
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:57,519
a process we apply all the time

2121
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,719
okay let's move on braun

2122
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,180
well

2123
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,719
[Music]

2124
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,520
um to what joel just said and also to

2125
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,560
add that

2126
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:14,320
often that the new voice coming in from

2127
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,679
outside will see stuff

2128
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:17,760
that wasn't necessarily seen by people

2129
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,239
who've been around for a long time

2130
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,920
by creating a process where only someone

2131
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,360
who's already an expert in everything

2132
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,760
iotf gets any say at all

2133
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,120
we're creating a very strong echo

2134
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,880
chamber for ourselves and we're not

2135
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,520
allowing new ideas in very much and

2136
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,280
i think that would also be a challenge

2137
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,040
here that that we're setting up saying

2138
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,120
until you're already you know well

2139
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,880
educated in the ways of iotf

2140
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,719
and and fully uh brought into the group

2141
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:43,120
think

2142
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,760
uh we we can't allow the voice

2143
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,639
that was that was my point john

2144
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,040
yeah a strong agreement with what joel

2145
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:57,120
and bronn have said already let me add

2146
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,639
uh one more thing to that list which is

2147
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,159
if you're looking for a highlight or two

2148
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:03,920
more things one of which is that if

2149
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,040
you're looking for a high-level

2150
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,360
professional for this position

2151
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,280
uh telling them when you're recruiting

2152
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,560
them that they

2153
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,159
don't have a voice they can offer

2154
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,760
opinions but people may not

2155
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,920
may not pay any attention to them and

2156
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,239
make following the precedent they got us

2157
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,440
into this trouble

2158
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:20,960
be able to lock them out of meetings and

2159
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,719
discussions what's going on

2160
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,480
is a really good way not to be able to

2161
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,320
hire such a professional

2162
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,000
uh so there's there's there's an

2163
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,360
interaction there

2164
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,719
with who's likely to be interested in

2165
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,480
the job and

2166
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,239
uh and beyond that uh

2167
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,480
i want to reinforce what joel said which

2168
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:39,520
is that if

2169
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,239
uh if this person is standing up and

2170
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:43,520
blocking things

2171
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,199
which they don't understand because the

2172
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:47,199
community because they're out of touch

2173
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,080
with the community

2174
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:50,000
and and don't understand they're out of

2175
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,120
touch with the community

2176
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,560
and can't be convinced they're out of

2177
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,320
touch with the community that we've done

2178
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,520
a rather

2179
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,600
rather bad job of finding the right

2180
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,199
person to hire

2181
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:03,199
and uh and i i recognize the risks there

2182
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,040
but this gets back the question of

2183
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:06,480
whether we can actually

2184
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,239
recruit and hire somebody who's suitable

2185
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,560
for this job if we can

2186
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:12,239
then i see no objections giving them a

2187
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,480
vote following again on the previous two

2188
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,280
comments

2189
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,840
if we cannot then this whole discussion

2190
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,639
has

2191
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:21,920
is is uh is standing on quicksand

2192
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,520
thank you john uh

2193
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,360
jeffrey the

2194
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:32,560
we're we're hiring the this advisor

2195
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,400
editor because they're an expert on

2196
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,560
publishing and that's likely to be an

2197
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,719
expertise that is a small minority in

2198
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:40,480
the working group um

2199
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,280
and so it seems worth it if they see us

2200
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:44,719
making a mistake

2201
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,880
uh that's go from a from a publishing

2202
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,800
standpoint it's worth giving them that

2203
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,400
veto and letting them kick it back to

2204
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,600
the working group

2205
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,600
um especially if that veto is

2206
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,280
overrideable by the rest of the board

2207
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,639
if there's consensus against them

2208
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,199
okay martin

2209
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,719
go ahead only really only really got

2210
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:09,040
here

2211
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:11,199
to to address comments that uh that

2212
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,080
bronn made

2213
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,199
and then then john said something so

2214
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:19,040
um i think the the question of

2215
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,080
um direct power versus the ability

2216
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,840
to be heard is getting lost here and

2217
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,560
the um straw man that i saw erected in

2218
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,239
john's response to that was

2219
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:33,280
was quite a problematic one i think

2220
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,440
what we're trying to find is a way for

2221
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,639
this person

2222
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,159
to be a respected and

2223
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,880
constructive member of this community

2224
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,600
and to provide their expertise in the in

2225
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,040
the the best possible way

2226
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,480
offering their uh them a vote

2227
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,360
as as a carrot as part of the uh the

2228
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,880
hiring process i think

2229
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,800
is it putting the wrong sort of

2230
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:00,639
incentive structure in place

2231
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:03,280
i i think one of the the key things here

2232
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,280
is is making sure that

2233
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,520
they are treated as a professional and

2234
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,800
listen to and

2235
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,040
that doesn't necessarily mean taking a

2236
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,040
vote it doesn't mean that they

2237
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,159
have a seat with a vote on the approval

2238
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:16,800
board

2239
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,480
it just means that they uh

2240
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,159
we have a system in place for them to be

2241
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,560
heard when they have something to say

2242
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,400
and i think ex officio was one of the

2243
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,000
things that the people have floated in

2244
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,520
the in the chat and that sounds

2245
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,120
like it could be perfectly reasonable

2246
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,199
all right so at two points before you go

2247
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,639
away uh martin

2248
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,120
um i just wonder if you wanted to

2249
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,440
respond to the point that

2250
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,480
um jeffrey yaskin made

2251
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:47,679
in terms of uh the the ex

2252
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,760
the ass the aspect of expertise that can

2253
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,719
be uh outvoted lost or otherwise

2254
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,880
shouted down as sometimes happens in

2255
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,239
working groups and this is a concern

2256
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:58,000
that's been raised by others

2257
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,480
um what would be your response to that

2258
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,320
yeah i've i've heard this objection

2259
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,639
repeated on on a number of occasions

2260
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:09,760
and i i don't see that happening

2261
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,560
uh i i think we've we've had a number of

2262
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,719
occasions where there has been

2263
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:19,120
the lone voice in a working group and

2264
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,199
there has been genuine attempts to

2265
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:24,159
understand and reconcile that position

2266
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,080
i don't think we're talking about a

2267
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,600
whole bunch of teenagers here

2268
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,159
despite the behavior that we often see

2269
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:30,880
and so

2270
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,960
i i don't think that this is something

2271
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,719
that is going to enter into that

2272
01:28:34,719 --> 01:28:36,560
position and if that person

2273
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,880
cannot convince one of the approval

2274
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,239
boards members

2275
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:43,360
that they should exercise their vote uh

2276
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,560
to to block

2277
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,360
and reject something then i think then

2278
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,000
that's a problem

2279
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:57,840
okay um wow um ron and then joel

2280
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,080
said there which is that they should be

2281
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,480
able to convince another person

2282
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,639
one of the stream people to to exercise

2283
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,320
their block if they can't convince them

2284
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,280
at all

2285
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,199
then they have the option of resigning

2286
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:12,400
which is

2287
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,520
pretty much where you're at at that

2288
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,960
point if you feel really strongly about

2289
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,320
something and you can't convince

2290
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,159
any of the stream managers then then you

2291
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,520
would resign

2292
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,639
but that would be the case whether you

2293
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:22,719
had a vote or not so i don't see they're

2294
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:24,480
having the vote making much difference

2295
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,679
either way in all of this um

2296
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,360
and so it comes back to is having the

2297
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,199
vote a sign of respect that will

2298
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:33,760
make the position easier to to get

2299
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,280
people for or not

2300
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,080
um and that i think is a major area of

2301
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,360
disagreement in the working group

2302
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:47,519
thank you joel okay i mean

2303
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:53,040
the way i proposed this

2304
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,600
that any member had to be able to

2305
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,560
propose it

2306
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,159
had to be able to persuade at least one

2307
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,600
other member to support them

2308
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,639
to get their view sustained that seemed

2309
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,080
like the right balance

2310
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,040
for all of the streams if one stream is

2311
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:08,320
saying

2312
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,840
for all of the participants because if

2313
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,840
one stream is saying this hurts my

2314
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,560
stream

2315
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,920
and everybody else looks at them and

2316
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,280
goes but i don't think it does

2317
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,199
then they probably are wrong and they

2318
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,960
just keep and we go forward

2319
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,719
but if somebody else agrees with them

2320
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:24,880
whether it's the rsa or another stream

2321
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,679
head

2322
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:29,040
then you force the issue and while i'm

2323
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,800
willing to accept that you need to get

2324
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,520
two three a total of three of the of the

2325
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,400
members

2326
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,719
to support a concern i think we're

2327
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:38,480
better off with two because if you can

2328
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,520
get two people

2329
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,280
saying wait no this is big enough that

2330
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,400
it matters then it probably matters

2331
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,719
and making the rsa one of those people

2332
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,000
make sure that there's a voice

2333
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,880
that is not focused principally on a

2334
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,560
single stream

2335
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,280
but on the series as a whole

2336
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,719
participating as a

2337
01:30:56,719 --> 01:30:59,600
full equal member of the discussion and

2338
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,520
yes we can say they must be respected

2339
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,239
but

2340
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:05,520
lots and lots of history shows us that

2341
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,880
it's not the same thing the iesg has

2342
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,639
gone back and forth on how they treat

2343
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:11,360
the iab

2344
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,920
chair in terms of membership on the iesg

2345
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,679
and that one is they're a full member

2346
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:16,560
even

2347
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,920
so let's be let's try to keep this

2348
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,080
as simple clean and respectful as

2349
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,559
possible

2350
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,440
yeah and uh that raises a point that i

2351
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,199
caused some confusion on a while ago x

2352
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:30,960
officio just means one sits on the

2353
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,600
board based on one's position it doesn't

2354
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:34,960
it doesn't necessarily mean

2355
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,440
uh anything else and somebody else said

2356
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:38,719
everybody on that board

2357
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,880
at the moment is ex-officio in terms of

2358
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:41,840
how it's

2359
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,040
uh defined um i think uh

2360
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,440
we're up to pete on this point good

2361
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,000
morning t

2362
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,560
can't hear you pete lots of buttons to

2363
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,719
push in my browser to give it permission

2364
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:04,159
um so

2365
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:07,040
i i think you know looking at the jabber

2366
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,000
chat i i

2367
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,880
agree with joel that the you know it

2368
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,639
still requires

2369
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:16,159
the r-s-e-a-a-e whatever

2370
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,080
um to find one other person to agree

2371
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,320
with and what martin has said in the

2372
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:21,280
jabber chat

2373
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,840
is well but that's enough to delay the

2374
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,320
process

2375
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,560
delaying the process doesn't bother me

2376
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,239
that much in this case

2377
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:33,840
um if the rsa

2378
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,800
feels strongly that this is a problem

2379
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,960
and the expectation is

2380
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,560
that everybody on this board is going to

2381
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,719
be given the message

2382
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,440
that your expectation is you're doing

2383
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,000
what

2384
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,239
is best for the community here and that

2385
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,679
the community is going to eventually

2386
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:50,880
agree to

2387
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,719
then the rsa throwing up a hand and

2388
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:54,000
saying whoa i think this

2389
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,040
really does need to stop um

2390
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:00,639
i think the the problem attack surface

2391
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,840
here is pretty minimal

2392
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:06,400
right uh i i see absolutely no reason

2393
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:09,360
that this person shouldn't have a say in

2394
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,960
stopping a document that they think

2395
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,840
is really a problem and coming back

2396
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,360
around and finding one other person to

2397
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:16,560
support them

2398
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,520
and the delay is worth it at that point

2399
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:20,960
we're talking about someone

2400
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,440
who eventually the community can say to

2401
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:24,639
the llc

2402
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:27,600
fire this person they're an idiot if

2403
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,440
that comes down to it

2404
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,280
um so the community does have a push

2405
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,760
back point if the person is really out

2406
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,880
of control

2407
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,400
in the same way that we have a pushback

2408
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,400
point with all of the other

2409
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,199
stream head appointees i think we should

2410
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:42,560
go ahead and give them

2411
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,679
the ability to say that

2412
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,719
uh thanks very much pete rich of course

2413
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,000
you have a solution for us all

2414
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,840
go on yeah sure just give me a try put

2415
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,120
me in charge of everything

2416
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,559
um yeah so

2417
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:01,760
i'm more worried about the ietf and its

2418
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,320
participants behaving badly to the paid

2419
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,520
professionals

2420
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,520
then the paid professionals doing

2421
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:10,719
something wrong that will hurt the ietf

2422
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,679
um and so optimize the common case as

2423
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,760
they say we have plenty of experience

2424
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,360
with like people behaving badly and

2425
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,120
causing competent people to get

2426
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,880
frustrated and leave not just paid

2427
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,040
professionals and otherwise

2428
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,400
as pete just said we have a way we can

2429
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,480
influence or moderate behavior if

2430
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,840
the paid professional goes off the rails

2431
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:36,320
but i'm not worried about that happening

2432
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:40,239
thanks rich

2433
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:42,400
phil good morning uh good morning to you

2434
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,600
yes

2435
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,719
yes so yeah oh well rich said half of

2436
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,080
what i was going to say

2437
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,119
uh i agree that the problem is probably

2438
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:53,040
the opposite way around

2439
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,679
but the other thing is that hey look if

2440
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:56,800
the itf

2441
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,400
was a representative organization

2442
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,679
in which we actually voted for anybody

2443
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:06,719
then we would have representatives and

2444
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:07,840
the iab

2445
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:11,040
and iasg would be answerable to the

2446
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,080
community

2447
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:16,080
they're not there are no representatives

2448
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:18,159
in iatf i don't get to vote for

2449
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:21,920
anybody so the idea that i've got to get

2450
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,800
really worried about the rsa not getting

2451
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,560
not being part of a community yet

2452
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:30,239
getting a vote i mean like

2453
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:33,840
i just don't see the distinction between

2454
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:34,880
having the

2455
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:39,440
llc iasg or whoever appointing somebody

2456
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,639
and them getting a vote and

2457
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,520
non-com appointing somebody and them

2458
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:46,800
getting a vote

2459
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,440
they're both completely opaque

2460
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:53,760
non-representative bodies you've chosen

2461
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,560
a model

2462
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:58,080
which is non-representative so

2463
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,320
just take that out of the equation if we

2464
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,639
want to talk about representative

2465
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,400
um structures in itf this is not where i

2466
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,840
would start

2467
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,280
fasting all right um

2468
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,800
mark and then um i have a question

2469
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,119
after you speak okay so please go ahead

2470
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,560
have i press enough buttons apparently

2471
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,000
you have pressed enough buttons

2472
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,280
congratulations

2473
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,960
that's right i do not agree with rich in

2474
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:29,440
phil

2475
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,560
i do not think that we need to invert

2476
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:32,960
this

2477
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,119
that the concerns about the person this

2478
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,400
position

2479
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:39,520
are something we need to keep in mind um

2480
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,719
and to pete uh i don't agree with the

2481
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,280
assertion that all the llc can just go

2482
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:45,920
and

2483
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,080
get rid of this person or or discipline

2484
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,080
them if a problem arises

2485
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:53,360
that's how we got here all right

2486
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,440
the this is an emotional position for a

2487
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,600
lot of people for whatever reason

2488
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,199
the power relationships are indistinct

2489
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:05,360
and the llc has a a very

2490
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,080
qualified role in how governance happens

2491
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:08,560
here

2492
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,320
and so saying oh the llc can take care

2493
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,679
of this i i don't buy it

2494
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:16,400
okay mark stay with me for just a moment

2495
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,239
i have a question for you

2496
01:37:18,239 --> 01:37:19,920
and it's not of course not just for you

2497
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,600
but uh but i'd like

2498
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,199
you to take a shot at it first which is

2499
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:28,560
how does the performance of this

2500
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,520
person get evaluated and who does the

2501
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,239
evaluation

2502
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,920
um that that is one of the

2503
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,719
key questions that we need to be asking

2504
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:43,920
in this effort

2505
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,840
um you know to to all the discussion

2506
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,199
about uh whether this person's on the

2507
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,159
board or not

2508
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,920
i'll reiterate what i think i've said in

2509
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,239
chat and maybe online before which is

2510
01:37:54,239 --> 01:37:57,360
i am fine as long as this person's you

2511
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,679
know vote or or blocking can be overcome

2512
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,119
i'd be more comfortable with two other

2513
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:02,480
people rather than just one other person

2514
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,360
but you know

2515
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,000
we'll see how it goes but the the

2516
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,840
question is asked is really fundamental

2517
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,719
here

2518
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:12,400
that you know people are saying that the

2519
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,280
llc's

2520
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,960
governance of this person is equivalent

2521
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,800
to the stream managers and it's it's

2522
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,080
very obviously not um so what kind of

2523
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:21,199
governance

2524
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,360
and oversight of this person are we

2525
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,560
talking about

2526
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:27,199
and in in a good solution i think this

2527
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:28,000
person

2528
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,920
will have confidence in their position

2529
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,199
if they're doing a good job and they're

2530
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:32,880
competent they're professional

2531
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,080
um but if they're not then we need some

2532
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,199
way to make sure

2533
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:39,280
that we're getting what we're paying for

2534
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:40,719
and the advice that we

2535
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,080
you know many people are asserting that

2536
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,000
we need and so how the

2537
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,800
community comes to a decision about that

2538
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,920
is tricky

2539
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:49,199
and that's what we should be talking

2540
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,760
about because as we've seen it can be

2541
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,800
really controversial

2542
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:58,880
um i think that was a great

2543
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,920
elaboration of my question uh

2544
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:07,440
i wonder if um do you have thoughts as

2545
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:08,000
to

2546
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:11,360
how that would um play out let me let me

2547
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,520
throw up a straw man as an example

2548
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,960
right you could imagine jay um

2549
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,400
for instance putting out a poll to the

2550
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,320
community saying can you please

2551
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,119
provide uh in confidence your view and

2552
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:25,119
you being any member of the community

2553
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:28,159
uh of the performance of the rsc and

2554
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:29,840
please be specific based on the

2555
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,239
responsibilities that the rsc has

2556
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:33,920
would and and then jay making the

2557
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,320
decision or the llc making the decision

2558
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,239
that's just a straw man and i don't mean

2559
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:40,159
for it to you know it matters the least

2560
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:41,440
amount coming from the chair

2561
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,040
how you know the community can come up

2562
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,560
with whatever they want on this

2563
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,239
but what it what would be your view

2564
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:52,159
personally firstly i hope that's fine

2565
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:56,159
sorry that's me uh i think that would be

2566
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:57,440
fine but i suspect

2567
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,560
based on what we've seen that

2568
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,159
no matter what happens parts of the

2569
01:40:02,159 --> 01:40:03,520
community would not accept that decision

2570
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,400
and it would put a

2571
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,119
tremendous amount of pressure on the llc

2572
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:08,159
and if i were

2573
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,000
on the llc i would not want that coming

2574
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,239
at me

2575
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,040
joel

2576
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:21,600
if we have an rsa and they have

2577
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,040
established

2578
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:24,560
that they know how to do the job and

2579
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:25,760
they have established that they are

2580
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:27,199
doing a good job and they have been

2581
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:29,280
reappointed multiple times

2582
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,440
and then for reasons the community can't

2583
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:32,719
understand

2584
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,320
the llc suddenly had fired them

2585
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,400
that would indeed cause much the same

2586
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,880
ruckus that we had

2587
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,280
in contrast if we have a new rsa who

2588
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,800
maybe has been in there a year or two

2589
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,000
hasn't shown

2590
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,719
much of any real understanding in the uh

2591
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:50,880
and the llc or the executive director

2592
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,000
says

2593
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,840
based on the feedback from the community

2594
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,520
this person is not working we're gonna

2595
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,600
have to do a new search

2596
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,320
really i don't think the community will

2597
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,480
go ballistic and i think

2598
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,400
to the degree they will that's a problem

2599
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,719
we have to face but i don't see a better

2600
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,800
alternative for managing this

2601
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:12,960
whether they have a vote or not and

2602
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,440
i think that

2603
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,239
yeah okay so all right i think everybody

2604
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:21,280
has had

2605
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,440
um a pretty big say on this mark we'll

2606
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:24,480
give you the last word and then i'm

2607
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:24,960
gonna

2608
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,560
let let's close the microphones on this

2609
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,480
because uh we

2610
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,119
we're gonna run out of time thank you i

2611
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,639
i don't

2612
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,639
disagree on any particular point with

2613
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:36,239
joel there um i would

2614
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:38,639
just i i think that it maybe there is no

2615
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:39,920
better solution

2616
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,920
but i would ask that we craft in great

2617
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,199
detail

2618
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:48,719
the expectations for how this person

2619
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:51,360
is their you know contract is renewed

2620
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,119
and how the community is consulted and

2621
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:54,639
so forth and so on

2622
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:56,480
so there's no disagreement about what's

2623
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,560
happening because i think that was the

2624
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:01,199
nexus of what happened before

2625
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,840
um and and if we want this to be a

2626
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,119
smooth process

2627
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:06,960
unlike every other case in the ietf we

2628
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,560
need to write it down well

2629
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:10,560
um we were really bad at that so let's

2630
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:13,600
let's try and do a better job here

2631
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,639
okay uh thank you for that um

2632
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,119
i hope this will come as no shock to you

2633
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:19,840
mark

2634
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:22,719
um but uh whatever we say uh we need to

2635
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:23,840
write it down better

2636
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,679
um uh the the chair in me says oh good

2637
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:28,000
i'm

2638
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,280
hearing a potential volunteer to help

2639
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,639
uh propose some of that text so uh

2640
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,560
look for an email on that from me uh

2641
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,080
real soon now

2642
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,560
um okay uh we have spent a uh

2643
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:44,800
well over an hour close to an hour and a

2644
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:45,679
half uh

2645
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:47,280
talking about this slide first of all i

2646
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,719
want to thank joel

2647
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,320
uh for putting this together um

2648
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:57,040
we are uh not yet at consensus

2649
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,719
i think people have heard

2650
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:04,320
each other on this point i don't believe

2651
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,239
there's a lot of talking past each other

2652
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:08,480
at this point to be honest

2653
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,239
i think everybody knows everybody else's

2654
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,080
position

2655
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,719
um the only you know we've heard from

2656
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:16,320
some people say that they're

2657
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,719
uh in terms of the people who are in the

2658
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:19,520
slightly

2659
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:22,320
less than the slightly greater group

2660
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,679
that is to say the people who would

2661
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:25,040
prefer the

2662
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:27,520
people who would prefer the the the rc

2663
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,040
not have a vote i think we've heard some

2664
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,239
of them say

2665
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:33,520
that they would be um a little

2666
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:38,159
uh somewhat comfortable if there were um

2667
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:41,440
uh uh blocking points on

2668
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:43,760
uh uh there would be overrides available

2669
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:44,480
particularly

2670
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:47,679
uh you know two additional uh chair over

2671
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,119
uh

2672
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,679
override votes uh from the board in

2673
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:54,000
order to sustain that person's

2674
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,040
view and i think we heard just in this

2675
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:59,119
last part of the conversation

2676
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,840
that at least one participant would be

2677
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:03,440
much more comfortable

2678
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,000
and i think others too if they

2679
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,119
understood better

2680
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:11,119
the accountability of the rsea

2681
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:16,239
so here's my proposal

2682
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:19,280
my proposal is that we run in that

2683
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,760
general direction

2684
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:24,880
um that what we

2685
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:29,119
what what has to happen are two things

2686
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:33,040
first um the proposal that joel has

2687
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:36,000
has to be encoded a little bit more with

2688
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:36,880
that

2689
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,639
two overrides second

2690
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:43,760
we need to um clarify

2691
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,119
the accountability of the rsea

2692
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:49,280
in terms of how that who that person is

2693
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,560
responsible to

2694
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:53,760
and how that person will be uh

2695
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,360
judged and that this would be

2696
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:01,280
a um a whole you knows compromise

2697
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:03,440
for most for most the people who at

2698
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:04,880
least for some of the people

2699
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,080
who did not prefer the um

2700
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,800
paid professional person have a seat on

2701
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:11,679
the board

2702
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:13,760
it would be um there would probably be a

2703
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:15,679
couple of people in the rough

2704
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,480
what i propose is that we get that this

2705
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:19,199
written down

2706
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,480
and then we take uh a consensus call on

2707
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:23,840
it and see

2708
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:27,040
how rough the consensus is this is

2709
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,760
my proposal before i ask for comments

2710
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:30,560
from

2711
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,080
uh the rest of the room i just want to

2712
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,840
ask for comments from my

2713
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,320
uh co-chair who um i'm sort of popping

2714
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:36,880
this on

2715
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,719
as well because you know we didn't know

2716
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:40,239
which way the conversation would go so

2717
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:41,760
brian do you want to add or

2718
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,440
you feel free to be the first person to

2719
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:46,000
disagree with me

2720
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:50,719
uh i mean

2721
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,880
that we're going to be in the rough

2722
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,960
rough consensus side

2723
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:57,199
uh on any of the major issues that we

2724
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:59,839
have

2725
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,560
and so i'm i'm okay trying to see how

2726
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,960
that goes we have tried many things that

2727
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:09,440
didn't work

2728
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,000
and so trying something else is a fine

2729
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
thing to do let's try it

2730
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,119
um yeah rough rough that's that's what

2731
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:17,600
it is

2732
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,119
i'll get my dog um right

2733
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:24,159
now so sure go ahead okay

2734
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:27,199
let's try it uh uh we'll we'll proceed

2735
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:28,320
along the uh well

2736
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:31,280
first let me ask for any uh comments

2737
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,000
from the

2738
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,840
from the group because uh before we

2739
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:35,040
proceed if

2740
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:38,320
if there's a real you know

2741
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,560
fury in that approach you know based on

2742
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:42,080
you know you guys know the

2743
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:43,520
way things have worked in the past we've

2744
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,679
had difficult conversations

2745
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,440
in the past you know that we've been on

2746
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,520
these points for a long time

2747
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:53,119
so if you have a real um

2748
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:55,360
agita over what i'm proposing you'll

2749
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,440
have the opportunity again to

2750
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,960
to object to whatever comes out if

2751
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,080
if you have strong concerns about this

2752
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:05,280
proposal

2753
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,560
um please say so now and of course

2754
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,080
everything we talk about here and

2755
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,320
everything we we agree on here

2756
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,080
has to be confirmed on mailing list as

2757
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,199
well because we know that there are

2758
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:16,800
people who are not able to participate

2759
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:23,840
at this point

2760
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:26,960
okay either people are fumbling for the

2761
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,800
um the button to ask for

2762
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,880
for comment or we're going to proceed on

2763
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:33,040
those long along those lines and as

2764
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,239
um we get to the next point

2765
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:39,679
um what i want to do is also

2766
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:45,199
just note um the issue that mike raised

2767
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,840
um is something i want to query

2768
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,360
separately and we'll take that

2769
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,960
into onto the list which is

2770
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,880
um how are are people concerned about

2771
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,679
the weighting of the iab in this process

2772
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:01,119
in terms of

2773
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:04,719
if if selecting uh the three of the four

2774
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:06,000
stream managers and

2775
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,199
et cetera and um mike go uh you wanna

2776
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:12,480
um take the the flaw on that point or on

2777
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,600
another point

2778
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,360
i just don't wanna lose track of that

2779
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,360
issue and i i wanna make sure we

2780
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:20,320
recover it i don't i don't want to phase

2781
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,679
it i don't want to

2782
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:24,960
put that in as a iav versus everybody

2783
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,719
i'm just saying that's one of the points

2784
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:28,480
with respect to the current current

2785
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:31,040
structure all i'm saying is that i think

2786
01:48:31,040 --> 01:48:34,320
besides the the stream managers who are

2787
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,840
probably going to turn over

2788
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,560
maybe every year based on the

2789
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,000
composition of the bodies that are

2790
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,440
sending them with the exception of the

2791
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,719
ise

2792
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:45,760
it might be useful to have

2793
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,679
a set of at large members that are

2794
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:49,840
selected for say three years

2795
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,719
and they turn and and they're they're

2796
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:54,400
there specifically to provide some

2797
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,360
memory

2798
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,320
um and and some consistency going

2799
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,719
forward

2800
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,000
and then i have one additional question

2801
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,080
relating to that which is

2802
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:10,080
does that possibility of a proposal in

2803
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,760
terms of

2804
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,280
does that impact people's view

2805
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:18,400
on the other conversation

2806
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,679
right in terms of whether the the rca

2807
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:24,719
ea has a vote if you haven't spoken on

2808
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:25,440
that point

2809
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,199
in particular and you think it's

2810
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:28,639
something that that that

2811
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:30,880
impacts your point of view do please

2812
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:33,679
comment mark

2813
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,719
discuss this a bit in jabra to me it

2814
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:40,800
just muddies the waters i

2815
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,639
i'm concerned with reconstituting our

2816
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:44,080
sock effectively there

2817
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,639
i i would like this this advisory board

2818
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:48,239
to be as lightweight as possible and

2819
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,280
that the real work happens in the

2820
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,320
working group

2821
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,400
and and and to me finding people are

2822
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,480
willing to put their hands up

2823
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:57,599
uh to to be on that advisory board and

2824
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:58,159
and

2825
01:49:58,159 --> 01:49:59,760
not as part of another role but on their

2826
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,159
own i i just have lots of questions

2827
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:03,280
about the quality of the candidates that

2828
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,800
would get so to me this money's the

2829
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,159
water so i'd rather just see it be the

2830
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:07,119
stream editors

2831
01:50:07,119 --> 01:50:09,440
and yes the rsea if that's what we need

2832
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,239
to do

2833
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:11,760
and then get the balance right with

2834
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,440
those make it a lightweight

2835
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,280
approval board which is how we've

2836
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,800
couched it to now

2837
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,719
making more heavy weight doesn't help

2838
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:21,280
okay approval board is how it was

2839
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,719
defined not advisory board yeah yes

2840
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,360
and let me just have i don't we don't

2841
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:28,800
really have time for a full-scale

2842
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:29,920
conversation

2843
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,960
on the merits of the proposal just

2844
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,560
in the context of the um

2845
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,920
i just want to understand if there's an

2846
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,360
interaction there that we need to be

2847
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,800
aware of that that that was

2848
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,320
that was my my only concern okay um

2849
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:45,920
i don't see any requests for the floor

2850
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,520
so we're going to proceed along those

2851
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,800
lines

2852
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,940
uh as as i as i proposed um

2853
01:50:51,940 --> 01:50:53,520
[Music]

2854
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:56,960
i i may call upon joel to help me on

2855
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:57,280
this

2856
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,639
and along with um one other person

2857
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:03,040
um and let me just switch slide decks

2858
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,159
now joel we're gonna

2859
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:06,560
uh we have we have to conclude your your

2860
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,840
deck i know you didn't quite get to the

2861
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:08,960
finish

2862
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,239
part on this um but uh obviously uh

2863
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:15,119
the the previous the next slide was open

2864
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:16,320
issues

2865
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,000
you know we got a bunch of them so we'll

2866
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,159
come back to that at another point

2867
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:22,400
let me stop sharing this one i want to

2868
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:24,639
go back to the other deck

2869
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:27,920
for a moment okay and then

2870
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,280
because we're going to run out of time i

2871
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,639
want to make sure we get this other

2872
01:51:30,639 --> 01:51:35,840
stuff done

2873
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:39,840
[Music]

2874
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:44,159
this one okay

2875
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:47,360
so um well we didn't get to these guys

2876
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,080
yet

2877
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:52,560
surprise okay let's see here

2878
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,760
um all right

2879
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,000
oops so um

2880
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,400
this is our next point um

2881
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:07,520
well uh i'm not sure if peter

2882
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:10,400
quite knows what he's gotten himself

2883
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,480
into yet

2884
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:17,119
um so but we should all uh thank him

2885
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:20,239
profusely for um

2886
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:23,280
offering to be a document editor

2887
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,320
um i want to just go over sort of the

2888
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,239
general approach that we're asking

2889
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:31,679
peter to take the first of which is

2890
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,960
um something that uh the working group

2891
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:37,119
uh raised and we're responding to which

2892
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:38,080
is that

2893
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,880
you know in terms of normative language

2894
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,880
uh things that are

2895
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,000
that really guide the the the role

2896
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,440
the the the the a b the working group

2897
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,000
process

2898
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,239
all of that um especially with big

2899
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:53,920
ticket items right

2900
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:56,560
uh all of that has to be uh run through

2901
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,159
the group in advance

2902
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:01,119
nobody's going to be advantaged by there

2903
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:01,520
being

2904
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,599
text that they didn't have to fight

2905
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:04,880
against

2906
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,880
because that the working group didn't

2907
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,960
discuss right this is something that

2908
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:11,760
multiple people raised as being a

2909
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,440
concern in terms of adopting earlier

2910
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,159
work

2911
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:17,040
so uh that's the general uh approach

2912
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,080
that we'll take

2913
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:21,599
now um that doesn't mean that the editor

2914
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:22,000
won't

2915
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,159
actually edit right some of the

2916
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:25,840
sometimes when we write this stuff down

2917
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,679
and the way we write it down

2918
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:31,119
it it sounds like vogue on poetry to

2919
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:32,480
borrow it

2920
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:35,040
an expression from a bygone era nobody

2921
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:36,639
can actually read it and people who read

2922
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:36,880
it

2923
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,400
can't stand it and so it will be um

2924
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,320
peter's job to make sure not only that

2925
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,320
the consensus is adhered to

2926
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,159
but the really tough job is that

2927
01:53:46,159 --> 01:53:47,520
somebody who's reading this document

2928
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:50,560
will actually understand what we meant

2929
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,599
um and so of course as he smooths that

2930
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:54,480
language

2931
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,400
um you know he shouldn't be changing the

2932
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:57,840
meaning and he'll you know he's an

2933
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:58,719
excellent

2934
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:00,239
one of the nice things about peter he's

2935
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:02,320
is that he's a phenomenal master of the

2936
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:03,679
english language

2937
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:06,719
um and i'm sure he's he's very capable

2938
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,280
in those regards so you know he'll be

2939
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,639
bringing this stuff back to us and of

2940
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:11,599
course people

2941
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:14,480
will have um an opportunity to comment

2942
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,480
what he's concerned with

2943
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:19,440
the uh and so again please take a moment

2944
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:20,400
to thank

2945
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:23,920

come in

2954
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:45,599
with at least uh an early draft uh

2955
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,760
at our next interim meeting um just

2956
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,760
prior to our next new meeting hopefully

2957
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,599
which with stuff with which we have

2958
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:53,199
agreed and we have agreed on

2959
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:55,840
uh a fair amount now just because we've

2960
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:56,800
agreed on

2961
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:58,560
text right once it hits the draft that

2962
01:54:58,560 --> 01:54:59,920
people see concerns and

2963
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,800
text of course you should raise them

2964
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,599
right

2965
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:05,679
and we would like to you know make sure

2966
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:06,880
that people are comfortable with the

2967
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,719
language as it reads

2968
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:11,440
as as the draft progresses but we're now

2969
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:12,560
at the point where

2970
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,880
um you know you have some amount of

2971
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,480
agreement on some number of points we

2972
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,119
have a

2973
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,679
big issue to to still try and work

2974
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,119
through and we're going to try and work

2975
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:22,480
through that

2976
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:25,520
um and um

2977
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:28,400
but hopefully by the april meeting you

2978
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:30,560
will be able to see some text

2979
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,560
to which you can say yep that's what we

2980
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,719
said that looks good to me

2981
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:36,239
um people will take care of some

2982
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:38,159
boilerplate maybe some of the

2983
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:41,598
mostly you know the stuff that we uh

2984
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,760
we'd expect in an introduction things

2985
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,599
like that

2986
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:48,340
so thanks very much for that peter

01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:10,000
um this is the same time that we've

2993
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
mostly been holding to from the northern

2994
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,119
hemisphere

2995
01:56:13,119 --> 01:56:16,639
perspective over the last

2996
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:20,560
few meetings we're roughly speaking

2997
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:24,320
however as we head into summer time in

2998
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,960
the north and winter time in the south

2999
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,960
um the inconvenience rises

3000
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:34,239
and so um we have to work out when the

3001
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:34,880
meeting

3002
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,560
after the april moon will occur um

3003
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:42,560
and i will put out a doodle poll

3004
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:45,760
sometime soon for that um but please

3005
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,360
feel free to share your views both

3006
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:49,840
on list into the chairs as to how you

3007
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,679
think that should proceed

3008
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:54,239
um any comments on this before uh or on

3009
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:56,320
the on peter's selection

3010
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,400
before we conclude to with any other

3011
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:00,799
business

3012
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,760
okay then we are at

3013
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:13,119
any other business this is your

3014
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:14,639
opportunity to raise any issue you care

3015
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:15,760
to raise that wasn't

3016
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:24,880
in the agenda

3017
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,199
all right not seeing any requests for

3018
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:28,480
the floor

3019
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,880
um what i would like to do fur before we

3020
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,320
close is

3021
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,360
uh first thank very much

3022
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:38,480
um dominique uh for having taken uh

3023
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:41,040
notes uh we really appreciate that we'll

3024
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,040
get draft minutes out real soon

3025
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,760
now uh and before we conclude brian do

3026
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:48,320
you have anything you'd like to add

3027
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,440
uh no i uh thank you all for

3028
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:54,239
for your participation and and uh and

3029
01:57:54,239 --> 01:57:55,760
your thoughts and

3030
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,719
um i urge you to try and figure out how

3031
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:00,960
how we can compromise on some of these

3032
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:02,400
harder issues

3033
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,440
um it's very clear that we don't have

3034
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:08,400
a rough consensus yet even a rough rough

3035
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,760
consensus

3036
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:11,920
and that means some people are going to

3037
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,520
have to change their minds

3038
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:16,719
in order for us to get get somewhere uh

3039
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:18,639
i don't mean change their minds come

3040
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:21,199
come to some kind of compromise

3041
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:22,880
and you might be thinking about what it

3042
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,480
is that you could do

3043
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:26,800
um because some of these issues have

3044
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,360
been hanging on for a really long time

3045
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:31,199
and we're going to have to power through

3046
01:58:31,199 --> 01:58:33,599
them one way or another

3047
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:37,119
so we've talked a lot to each other

3048
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:40,000
about what we think

3049
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,719
and we clearly have a couple of issues

3050
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,400
for which

3051
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:46,400
we're going to have to come up with some

3052
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,719
compromise now we did right i mean this

3053
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:51,920
the whole av plus work group was a major

3054
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:53,440
compromise and there have been a few

3055
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,880
others

3056
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,560
but some of these issues now are going

3057
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,480
to require compromise and i need

3058
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,880
everyone to be thinking about where they

3059
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,719
can compromise in order to

3060
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:05,280
make some progress thank you thank you

3061
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,040
um lawrence has asked the question if i

3062
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:09,119
can say something about timelines

3063
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:11,760
uh so lars i can only say this we're

3064
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,000
going to start to have a rough draft out

3065
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,400
in fact i'll put a milestone in the in

3066
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:18,400
the tracker for the

3067
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:21,920
first cut draft of what we've agreed

3068
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:25,280
uh in april um

3069
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:28,480
the my intent is to work

3070
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:32,000
with um brian

3071
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,159
and joel and

3072
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:39,679
peter on some text that

3073
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:43,119
we can shape to put forward for

3074
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:46,320
a sort of a compromise approach um

3075
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,880
what might what i'm my thinking is we'll

3076
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:51,199
have a discussion about that text

3077
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:53,679
uh maybe take some amendments based on

3078
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:55,280
that discussion

3079
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:59,199
and we'll have a uh

3080
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:01,840
then have a call for a rough consensus

3081
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,840
now if the discussion is very productive

3082
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,239
or

3083
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:05,840
we see issues that really come out of it

3084
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:08,320
that we haven't raised previously

3085
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,560
um it could that could last beyond the

3086
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:11,520
april meeting

3087
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,159
but my hope is that by the april meeting

3088
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:15,440
included

3089
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:19,040
that rough consensus call and if we have

3090
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:20,800
done so

3091
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,040
then we will discuss the results of that

3092
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:25,040
at the april meeting

3093
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,080
um and so

3094
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,239
as we go through that process just to

3095
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:31,679
reiterate

3096
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:35,280
the um points that brian made

3097
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:38,480
it's really important that um

3098
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:40,239
people communicate with each other not

3099
02:00:40,239 --> 02:00:41,920
necessarily uh

3100
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,080
not necessarily through the chairs or or

3101
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:44,960
even in

3102
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,239
even if you feel more comfortable just

3103
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,960
go bilaterally uh to try and find

3104
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:52,719
uh uh some uh some opportunity for

3105
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:55,280
uh to make sure that the the points that

3106
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:56,960
you most care about

3107
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:00,800
are all covered um and uh

3108
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,840
we will attempt to to to find you know a

3109
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:04,719
way forward where

3110
02:01:04,719 --> 02:01:06,880
the consensus is less rough if at all

3111
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:09,119
possible by doing that

3112
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:11,520
so that's the best i can answer on on

3113
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:12,800
the short term timeline

3114
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,679
if we are actually able to get through

3115
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:17,360
that process

3116
02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:19,199
then i think we can begin to build some

3117
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:20,480
momentum uh

3118
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:22,800
to start nail down the other issues and

3119
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,719
maybe by the next ietf meeting we'll

3120
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:25,440
have

3121
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:28,960
uh one draft that at least looks um

3122
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:31,599
uh promising uh to the group but there

3123
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:32,480
that's a big if

3124
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:34,800
let's recognize that it will very much

3125
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:36,800
depend on the community's

3126
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:39,119
uh willingness to let the the work go

3127
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:40,239
forward

3128
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:43,360
maybe i wanted to say something so yeah

3129
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,000
maria

3130
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,800
go ahead yeah i just want to add on this

3131
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:48,480
that there are certain time constraints

3132
02:01:48,480 --> 02:01:48,960
um

3133
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,360
i i believe everybody knows that but we

3134
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,800
have an interim

3135
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:55,280
rcc or manager which we have appointed

3136
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:55,840
for

3137
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,239
one year and this year is nearing the

3138
02:01:58,239 --> 02:01:59,760
end so we're already at the point where

3139
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:02,000
we have to make new decisions about

3140
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,639
how to how to extend the situation or

3141
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:06,560
how to handle the situation right

3142
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:09,040
so um there are time constraints here

3143
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:09,840
and

3144
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:11,760
it's hard to make any decisions hard to

3145
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:13,520
plan we don't know what's happening in

3146
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:14,800
this group

3147
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,480
and the sooner we come to any decisions

3148
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:19,839
the better of course

3149
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:22,639
okay you've gotten the last word we are

3150
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:23,679
over time

3151
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:26,000
um thank you everybody for your

3152
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:26,719
constructive

3153
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:29,840
engagement for your good comments your

3154
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:31,280

um i i wish things have gotten could

3156
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:34,800
have gotten a little further in terms of
