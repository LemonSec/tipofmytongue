00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,599
there are not many folks today pablo and

38
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,760
they mind taking the notes please

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,840
just it's a short meeting anyways

40
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,800
yeah thank you that's yes right

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,519
thank you

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,080
all right uh then this is agenda

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,720
for the meeting

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,319
today just you know uh a brief update

45
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,599
from the last meeting

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,200
between idea 109 and 109 on our 10

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,840
we have adopted the following document

48
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,959
as a working of document

49
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,400
this is a transport network aware

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
mobility for 5g

51
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,599
we ran the consensus call and there was

52
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,280
good amount of support and there were a

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,239
couple of objections and we worked with

54
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
we gave an opportunity for the authors

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
and the reviewers to you know address

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,959
those comments

57
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,599
right not uh much happened there were

58
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,800
mainly two objections

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,519
but uh we didn't get much feedback when

60
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,080
we worked

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,720
when we tried to it was all this offline

62
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,159
but uh but we still

63
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,680
chose to take up the document as a

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,480
working document but uh

65
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
we are hoping whatever the objections

66
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,720
that were raised

67
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
will be fixed in the you know the course

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
before between now and within the

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,200
document

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,959
becomes a is sent to ies

71
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:47,840
so that's with that i think

72
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
we'll see it in the day or two

73
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,599
uh that's then followed by i think

74
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
a quick update on the working of

75
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,519
documents

76
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,920
these are the active documents one is on

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,519
the user plane protocol architecture

78
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
analysis some hdb 5g system

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
and there was a recent update 04 version

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,080
i think this is

81
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,879
in a good shape i think we should be

82
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,519
able to

83
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,798
you know send you know issue

84
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
last call on this and there's a segment

85
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,839
loading ipv6 for mobile user plane

86
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,520
i think some few updates

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,759
happened between now and the last

88
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,040
meeting

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
and i think this also is completely

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
ready and all the dependencies are met

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,880
and uh we should be able to move this

92
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
document forward

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
and then this is the transport aware

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,639
network aware mobility for 5g as i said

95
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,720
this is just it was adopted as a working

96
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,160
document

97
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,639
so we should be able to do over the next

98
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,919
few months we should be able to

99
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,040
take more this forward

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
and today is with that we have two

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,800
presentations today

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
one is the one is the

103
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
architecture discussion on srv6 this is

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
an individual id

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,120
and uh miyazan has presented this

106
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
in the last meeting as well but you have

107
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,639
to you have not

108
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,840
issued an adoption call the plan is like

109
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,199
you know

110
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,039
plan is once we get few more reviews

111
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
from the working group

112
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
and we will we will be able to take this

113
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,680
up

114
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840
so i think with that i think and then

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
there's the segment routing

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,759
ipv6 for mobile user plan there's a

117
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,440
quick update on this as well

118
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,960
so these are the two presentations that

119
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,479
we have and

120
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,759
that's about it with that uh

121
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,840
anything you want to add sort of song

122
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,039
okay anything from you eric

123
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,880
no i'm just waiting when uh a working

124
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,919
group uh

125
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,759
adopted document comes my way for ed

126
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,919
evil

127
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,600
okay yeah fair enough yeah we'll

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,120
make that happen uh with that i think

129
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,680
let's go back to the

130
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,160
is mia there mia it's my son

132
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,840
presentation here

133
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
sorry

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,319

yeah thank you very much for your time

138
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,240
and the opportunity

139
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,759
um let me recap the um what

140
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,840
um we'd like to we'd like to

141
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
achieve with this draft so next page

142
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,039
please

143
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
so today i'd like to recap the objective

144
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,160
and some architectural discussion and

145
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,479
i have some new um exam purification

146
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,318
and conclusion and next step

147
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,240
next slide please

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,000
so to recap the objective

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
this draft discusses our solution

150
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,759
approach and its

151
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,160
architectural benefits of common data

152
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,039
frame

153
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,000
across domains and across layers

154
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,599
background for this is that the current

155
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,039
mobility related discussion in ietf

156
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
um like network slicing based on the

157
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
assumption of the existing domain and

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,120
the current gdp

159
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
which in my opinion in my opinion is not

160
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,840
good for

161
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,120
future for considering the new

162
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,840
architecture for future next please

163
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,479
so the current connection intensive

164
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,120
network

165
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,879
has the limitation um that

166
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,800
session termination point be a scaling

167
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,000
bottleneck

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,919
and the connection oriented network is

169
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,240
not

170
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,760
very optimized for edge distributed

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,799
computing

172
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,760
not optimized for any dna communication

173
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,000
and

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,159
policy and authentication are tied to

175
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,880
access methods and the security model

176
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
is parameter security

177
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,760
but for future um next page please

178
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,279
for future the network architecture is

179
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,760
more

180
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,120
data intensive and we are

181
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
discussing about distributed mobility so

182
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,640
mobility

183
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,440
entities will be distributed and the

184
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,200
computing workload will

185
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,120
also be distributed and um

186
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
access will be getting more

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
heterogeneous

188
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,200
and policy or security

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,680
will be considered

190
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,080
apart from the access method

191
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,279
next page please

192
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
and as you know srb6 is proposed as a

193
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:43,839
common

194
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,959
data frame across domains and

195
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,080
by srb6 net programming

196
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,519
which has now rfc it

197
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,519
can program program anything including

198
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,120
overlay functionalities such as gdp pxm

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,399
nsh and it could achieve simple flat

200
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,160
architecture and it can

201
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,720
be a common data plane across domains

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,079
and for both overlay and android

203
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
and it can be easily

204
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,200
it can easily interact with applications

205
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,800
with scaling and flexibility

206
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,360
so let me have some

207
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,880
examples next please

208
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
so for edge computing and network

209
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,230
slicing

210
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,409
[Music]

211
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,480
um so

212
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
there will be um workload

213
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,360
container port and we

214
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
would like to make the container port

215
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
belong to um arbitrary tenant or slice

216
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
and the

217
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,279
network should interact with

218
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,800
container port or applications

219
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,040
and we need to a way to

220
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
control or steer traffic flexibility

221
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,399
flexibly flexibly onto the

222
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,200
container pod so this kind of um

223
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,160
[Music]

224
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
functionality will be required for edge

225
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,519
computing platform

226
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
and for and for um

227
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,839
make the container pod belong to

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,440
tenant or slices

229
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
next page please

230
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,839
and the 3gpp discusses a lot of

231
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,959
you are llc and multipath

232
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
so for for

233
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
reliable transport gdp could be

234
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,079
um could um

235
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,839
we could have dual gtp tunnel um

236
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,519
also um 3gpp23793

237
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,360
discusses about multi-path

238
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
access traffic steering switch and

239
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,519
splitting support which is good

240
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,560
but this reliability

241
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,000
reliability or multiple convergence

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,040
should be better not completed within

243
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,599
gdp

244
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
i think layer 4 7 and application

245
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,839
interaction should be more considered

246
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,519
next split

247
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,600
so as a conclusion

248
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,760
[Music]

249
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,079
as mobile architecture entities become

250
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,360
more distributed

251
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,760
they have the potential to be integrated

252
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,519
as the platform for

253
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,800
edge distributed computing and new sl

254
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,959
sla delivery mechanisms but for that

255
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,240
it it is essential to consider this

256
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
across domains and across layers

257
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,839
and as i said the

258
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
mobility related discussion in ietf

259
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,480
like networks racing are based on the

260
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,040
existing assumption that the current

261
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
domain and the current gdp

262
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,839
so i really want to

263
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,320
um have dma working group

264
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
um adopt this document and

265
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,040
consider how to how

266
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,399
how how to um

267
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,920
make um across

268
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
domain or or across

269
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,079
um or how to

270
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
how to

271
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,800
how to apart from the existing gtp

272
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,359
practice

273
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
that is what i'd like to discuss with

274
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,440
this um

275
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
dma working group thank you very much

276
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,519
okay thank you yes

277
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,279
any questions comments

278
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,639
okay so miyazan so what do you want to

279
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,760
accomplish from

280
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,279
this uh is it a more sorry

281
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
sorry question

282
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
yeah okay so

283
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
i i recognize that that the connection

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,440
originate

285
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,680
nature of setting up pdu citizens

286
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,160
is not optimized for its computing

287
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,199
that's fair observation

288
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,160
but on the other hand if you consider

289
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,440
your 3 cpp is now hitting

290
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,480
is that we are now

291
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
in release 17

292
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
and it's building on top of two releases

293
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,399
already which are

294
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,279
using gtp as the basis for pdu system

295
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,360
for the quality of service

296
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
mostly of the management i i would say

297
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,279
that

298
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,320
changing this at this point would be

299
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,079
much too radical to be realistic

300
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,600
for 5g so i'm now wondering that

301
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
we have in in the iatf

302
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,720
or irtf corridors this discussion on

303
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,079
6g so maybe this is something to

304
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,560
discuss over there and change the

305
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,440
timeline so that we address 6g

306
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,759
rather than try to change something

307
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,040
which is

308
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,399
already nearly halfway off it

309
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,639
takes

310
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,440
my comments

311
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,210
so i think

312
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,880
[Music]

313
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,000
thanks thanks for your feedback

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,639
so i think one observation one comment

315
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,839
would be like

316
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,240
the dmm working group is not chartered

317
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,639
to say we are working only on 4g or 5g

318
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,759
or 6g

319
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,120
in general we are trying to solve the

320
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
mobility problems right

321
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
i think sure i think you know for the

322
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,240
srv6 work

323
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
the authors try to push it into the 3gbp

324
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,880
really 17 standard 1617 right

325
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,399
it did not happen but it does not

326
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,800
mean that like you know i think you know

327
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,519
you know

328
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,839
we have to really be under the scope of

329
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
5g or 6g but my point is

330
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,319
if there is an opportunity to push that

331
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,240
into future versions of 3gbp it may be

332
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,799
possible

333
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,240
but as long as we solve the right

334
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,799
technical problems right with that hanu

335
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,599
you think is there something that this

336
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,400
working group

337
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
should do or your are you recommending

338
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,079
that this only irtr should

339
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,079
this is only that this is the target iit

340
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
is the right place for this work

341
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,799
link is good linkage to this this

342
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,000
uh irtf discussions yeah

343
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
preparatory discussions maybe

344
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,280
dear google could comment this because i

345
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,200
think he's one of the drivers of

346
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,480
this discussion discussions in

347
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,480
this 60 interest group of ia

348
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,520
yes i think yeah

349
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,760
that that was my comment and observation

350
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,440
right

351
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,720
i'll leave to you to conclude

352
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,799
what is the best place to discuss these

353
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,240
matters

354
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
yeah yeah thanks hannah i think in

355
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,360
general i think you know if the problem

356
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,760
is

357
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,600
you know interesting enough if the

358
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,960
problem is relevant to mobility

359
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,840
architectures

360
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,640
right 5g 6g or in any other access

361
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,160
architecture i think in general i think

362
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
in my opinion we should

363
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,799
we should do it here but again it's up

364
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,679
to the working group and the ada and the

365
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,440
you know participation interest but i

366
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,240
think uh yeah i i think let's uh

367
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,919
get some more feedback any other

368
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,440
comments any other feedback on this

369
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
document

370
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
okay so yes and one question i have

371
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
right i think you know

372
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,760
you talked about the the the url c

373
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,559
scenarios in the 3 gbp that 3gb talks

374
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,200
about

375
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,120
i assume with srv6 you're only

376
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,880
addressing one of the scenarios right

377
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
only the network site

378
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,679
uh path redundancy right in other words

379
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:52,799
there's only the one

380
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,720
one of the scenarios but not all the

381
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
same urls scenarios can be addressed

382
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,160
through a services is that correct

383
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
um so sorry could you say it again

384
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
please

385
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,559
only scenario which yeah

386
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
yeah three 3gbp specification supports

387
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:11,840
multiple

388
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,679
scenarios for url right in one case the

389
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,400
uae can

390
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,440
be connected to two different brands and

391
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,320
potentially

392
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,320
there can be an end to end reliability

393
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
right that is one of the scenarios right

394
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,520
now then the core network redundancy so

395
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,520
my question is with srv6

396
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,320
what you're arguing is it's only one of

397
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,200
the scenarios

398
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
it you will be able to support right

399
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
which is the network

400
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,720
which is the redundancy on the network

401
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,840
side

402
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,960
yeah yeah well yes so sorry thank you

403
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,520
for

404
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,039
uh the question so srv6 supports

405
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,160
um any form of redundancy

406
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,919
what i wanted to raise this particular

407
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,320
model is that um

408
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,240
so ue could have um dual gtp which is

409
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:02,880
fine

410
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
but this model only has the

411
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,159
one connection and

412
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
and network is going to provide a

413
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,640
redundancy

414
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,200
but this model is not very um

415
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,559
i how can i say

416
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,640
efficient because gtp doesn't have um

417
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,679
knowledge of underlay so

418
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,440
how to make this diverse pass

419
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
this joint is um

420
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,440
is lacking from the 3gpp consideration

421
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,880
um so this is this is

422
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,240
not very effective

423
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,360
that's why i raised this point

424
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,880
so which doesn't mean that srv6

425
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,960
only supports this kind of redundancy

426
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
okay all right and that that helps

427
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
yeah uh any any other questions

428
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,760
comments otherwise we can move on to the

429
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,039
next topic

430
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,520
thank you yes before yeah sorry

431
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,480
um sorry i i wanted to just add on to

432
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,600
the comments

433
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,280
i also agree that you know gtp does have

434
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,360
limitations in terms of latency

435
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
you know reliability and all of those

436
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,799
things as

437
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,159
you know hanu and sri or all of you

438
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,159
remarked i did have a couple of

439
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,000
questions i mean this may be interesting

440
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,039
work but i

441
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,080
had a couple of questions that to

442
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
consider

443
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,240
in more specifically you know one is

444
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,799
does this impact the control plane on

445
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,600
the gtp

446
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,440
on the 3gpp side and if it does

447
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,320
then how do we handle you know how do we

448
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
go forward in a way that

449
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
you know does not impact that or

450
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,280
reduces the impact or how do we do that

451
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
it's somewhat related to hanu's comments

452
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
that you know a lot has been developed

453
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,240
already

454
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
for 5g so this may be something to think

455
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
about as we move forward

456
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,559
and a second question is more or less

457
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,840
about the

458
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,250
radio side they're also using

459
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,480
[Music]

460
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,039
gtp in the distributed when you

461
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,480
distribute between the

462
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,880
cu and the du that's also

463
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,440
gtp based and in all of these cases i

464
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,960
think there's some control plane

465
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,240
information to be considered

466
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,280
so if we decide to go forward i think

467
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,039
that's something that we must

468
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,440
look i mean to see that there is no

469
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,200
impact or

470
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
or some way that the impact can be

471
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,840
managed i think that'll be the challenge

472
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
yeah on the second point right when you

473
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,360
say there's a gtp between the cu and du

474
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,120
what do you mean by that orion talking

475
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,840
about the m3 the use of gtp on the n3 or

476
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,480
on the

477
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
on the vr

478
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,120
yeah okay it's

479
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
truly but that may be manageable i think

480
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,679
you know i haven't looked into

481
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,600
how this may um you know adversely or

482
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,360
not affect it but it it may be okay

483
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,559
because

484
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,440
i'm not sure you know the only my the

485
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,400
main point would

486
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,960
center around the control plane because

487
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,320
a control plane

488
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,360
is more or less you know

489
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,360
heavily intertwined into this whole

490
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,960
thing and

491
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
the control plane is managed you know

492
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,200
not in the ietf so

493
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,279
that's where i think the challenge will

494
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,039
be and something that we can think about

495
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,600
you know

496
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,159
i once we can get past that maybe there

497
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,279
are some

498
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,440
um you know interesting ways we can

499
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,159
solve for the radius idea and the core

500
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,440
yeah thank you thanks it's i think it's

501
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,679
a

502
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,200
fair comment and for that purpose

503
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,559
the srv6 mobile user plane

504
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,200
um defines the gtp to srv6

505
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,440
um mapping so that

506
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,039
so that we can insert with

507
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,880
um pre preserving the existing control

508
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,159
plane

509
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,320
but i'd like i wanted to point out that

510
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,840
if

511
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,440
we

512
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,360
[Music]

513
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,960
don't consider across domains and we

514
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,480
don't have a good

515
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,840
um slicing mechanism

516
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,320
or we don't we don't achieve a good

517
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,559
way for um edge computing platform

518
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,320
that's why i'd like to

519
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,320
how we can we can consider

520
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,720
not the not tied with the existing

521
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,919
practice features on gtp exists

522
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,880
and mobile domain and transport domain

523
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,279
is separated

524
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,080
yeah i mean just a last little bit i i

525
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,919
agree with the problem you know there is

526
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,960
no question that these problems exist

527
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
um it's only a question of how we manage

528
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
forward yeah

529
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,760
yeah thank you

530
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,640
very much yeah just one comment okay

531
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,000
so but john's key point uh mia

532
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
you're agreeing that there will be inter

533
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,799
impact to the control plane in other

534
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,159
words i'm assuming there is

535
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,400
impact to this n4 interface correct

536
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,279
so easily will there be impact to

537
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,400
the control plane i am guessing

538
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,360
right there is you need some extensions

539
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,520
on the n4 interface

540
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,440
correct an endpoint interface

541
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,440
yeah do you need extension or there will

542
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,760
there be any changes on info interface

543
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,080
yes i think so and also into

544
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,840
both ends of the tunnel needs to be

545
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,640
controlled right

546
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
speaking may i compliment sean just just

547
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
tiny

548
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
tiny addition that that so that we get

549
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,480
the minutes right

550
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
in addition it's not only f1 interface

551
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,080
it's also x

552
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,600
x n and that x mentioning x and which is

553
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
between these

554
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,400
uh run nodes uh there is so

555
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,880
that also leads to the question of

556
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,559
backwards compatibility

557
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,760
if we want to roam to 40.

558
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,000
of course we can say that this is next

559
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,640
generation network so we don't

560
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,120
need to carry all of the pop or the

561
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,720
heavy

562
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,200
heavy things of of backwards

563
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,640
compatibility but if we shoot for

564
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,520
five chip we need to have the backwards

565
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,559
compatibility

566
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,918
at at least 40.

567
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
okay

568
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,559
or any other comments yeah thank you

569
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,320
for comments yes yeah i think uh

570
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,000
a few things uh so your for your email

571
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,159
you want this document to be adopted as

572
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,520
a working group document

573
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,960
right yes yes yes since

574
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,320
dmm working groups should um discuss

575
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,640
about the distributed mobility

576
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
and so

577
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,960
okay so i think uh one thing you know i

578
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
would i would we would request the

579
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
working group is to review this document

580
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,880
and provide some feedback some good

581
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,799
points like you know from hanoi

582
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,320
john right and yourself right

583
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
i think we want some more feedback i

584
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
think you know can we

585
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,600
request few you know volunteers to sign

586
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:07,919
up

587
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,279
and provide some feedback you know any

588
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,399
anybody other than the office right can

589
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,880
you know can some any of you raise your

590
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
hands or like you know state that

591
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,640
you're willing to review this document

592
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,559
we want some names so that we can

593
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,080
capture into the meeting minutes

594
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
go ahead

595
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,559
i can provide some feedback okay that

596
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,880
is that john this is john yes john sorry

597
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,760
thank you mom

598
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
so now you're agreeing to review this

599
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,320
document anybody else please

600
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,480
as well of course yeah thank you hanu

601
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,120
that is too and and one more volunteer

602
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,000
please anybody else

603
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,559
do you guys hear me i'm trying to

604
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,480
to say something my my hand is raised

605
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,840
and i thought that was

606
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
going to go with my question we are not

607
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
following the protocol my apologies i

608
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,000
think we are

609
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,240
still you know okay the daniel please

610
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,279
sorry

611
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,600
yeah thank you um so i like the document

612
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,640
because there's a lot of

613
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,520
uh use case from an operator viewpoint

614
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,240
but

615
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,919
um maya when you i heard when you were

616
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,200
talking about the urlc use case with gpp

617
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,039
not being reliable

618
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,320
or not not reliable but doesn't interact

619
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,760
from

620
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,880
convergence i was just thinking how is

621
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,360
that possible because you're starting a

622
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,799
gtp from the radio all the way to the

623
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,520
packet core before we go with

624
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,960
satoru and and other proposition when we

625
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
stitch gtp with the savvy6 but just

626
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,880
before that if we

627
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,559
do gtp2 packet core

628
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,480
then whatever happened in the transport

629
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
is irrelevant

630
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,799
when i heard about the convergence time

631
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,880
for the

632
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,200
urlc requirement i i just don't

633
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
understand what you meant

634
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,399
by by that because technically

635
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,720
anything could happen underneath it it's

636
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,760
still not

637
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,279
gtp will will just follow whatever

638
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,000
new path happens and in the transport

639
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,840
without breaking anything

640
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,240
yeah ctpd um

641
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,840
so for for making more

642
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
reliable

643
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,760
they are thinking to have a dual gtp

644
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,120
path so to replicate

645
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,159
the traffic and the merge

646
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,799
for for ultra reliability um

647
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,840
but if they

648
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,480
don't control the underlying it's

649
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,840
it's not very effective so

650
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,120
i my point is to have um

651
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,360
control control controllability on

652
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,000
underlay um

653
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,440
which make the disjoint path um

654
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,000
effective

655
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,320
okay sorry do you know what i mean

656
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,760
well i'm not uh okay maybe uh i'll write

657
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,120
it in the mailing list

658
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,039
in my yeah yes sorry about that

659
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,760
no no no it's fine you were well

660
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,120
understood

661
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,559
um i just didn't the the

662
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,559
it's not how you pronounced it that it

663
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,960
doesn't um

664
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,799
make sense in my mind it's more than the

665
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,039
content on itself like

666
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,080
but i will write my question in the in

667
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,679
the mailing list and and

668
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,159
it would be better for you to answer

669
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,120
thank you very much

670
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,240
it helps a lot yeah that

671
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,919
that makes sense daniel thank you for

672
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,440
that so i think

673
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,799
so we have a few volunteers

674
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,919
signed up and i think uh you know

675
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,399
based on the feedback we are saying we

676
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,039
can uh

677
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,039
you know if there's interest right but

678
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,720
we want some more reviews i think i

679
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,440
this is what if you guys can also ask so

680
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,880
ask anybody to review and provide

681
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,760
feedback

682
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
i think we'll be able to move forward on

683
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
this document

684
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,320
so with that uh thank you yes on uh

685
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,480
next is a quick update on the

686
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,760
architecture discussions

687
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,960
services values

688
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,600
sorry yeah please

689
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,279
so to respond who is going to present i

690
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,919
am presenting

691
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,679
okay so many thanks for your time this

692
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,159
is pablo camarito from cisco

693
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,960
and this is a quick update on the

694
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,840
segment routing

695
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,960
ipv6 for mobile user plane um nexus

696
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,519
slide please

697
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,399
okay so as a very brief reminder um

698
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,360
what this document is discussing is the

699
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,679
um

700
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,120
applicability of facilities to the m3

701
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,279
n9 and n6 interfaces um to this purpose

702
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,320
this document standardizes um

703
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,960
how this uh how the mobile data plane

704
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,519
could work

705
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
so it's focused only on the data plane

706
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,200
and it is presenting

707
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,440
two modes for the data plane um the

708
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,039
so-called traditional mode and the

709
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,640
enhanced mode

710
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
and then this document has a set of

711
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,840
interworking mechanisms

712
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,399
for legacy and three interfaces which

713
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,440
are still running either ipv4 or ipv6

714
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,840
gdp nexus light please

715
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,320
okay so very briefly uh a bit uh as a

716
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,359
reminder on the

717
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,079
content of this document um so on this

718
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,440
document what we have is a bit of the

719
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,719
motivation and the

720
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,800
on the background use cases to do this

721
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,239
work and

722
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,159
then in section five we discussed the

723
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,079
traditional mode

724
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,599
which is just basically a pure

725
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,760
replacement of gdpu

726
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,239
um then we have a ball amor evolve mode

727
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,000
which is the enhanced mode

728
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,839
in this enhanced mode basically what we

729
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,440
have is that in addition

730
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
to the overlay we can also integrate

731
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,520
underlay traffic engineering

732
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,320
as well as nfv services so that is the

733
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,918
enhanced mode

734
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,359
and then what we are doing is we are

735
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,199
presenting a set of um

736
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,399
interworking mechanisms for an unchanged

737
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,000
and three interface okay

738
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,200
and these interworking mechanisms um

739
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,599
they are applicable to both ipv4 and

740
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,560
ipv6

741
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,240
uh gdp interfaces and we present them as

742
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,839
an extension to the enhanced mode but

743
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,119
they are equally applicable to the

744
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,880
traditional mode

745
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,680
um then we also have the srv6 dropping

746
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
interworking which was a work

747
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,440
from iras main um and then well as well

748
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,119
then for the purpose of

749
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,200
obviously defining this rv6 data plan we

750
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,280
are defining a set of srv6

751
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,359
segment endpoint behaviors which are

752
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,359
defined in section six

753
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,920
um and then we have a few considerations

754
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
on the control plane network slicing and

755
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,280
security

756
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,880
um next slide please

757
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,240
so that's a bit on the draft content um

758
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,920
data bit

759
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,839
moving into the history so the last time

760
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,720
we presented an update on this document

761
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,520
it was actually in the itf in singapore

762
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,640
pandemic

763
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,720
um so well this draft

764
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,880
the first revision we posted in july

765
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,440
2017 it was adopted as a working group

766
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,240
item in november 2017

767
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,680
and we've had 10 revisions as a working

768
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,079
group

769
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,280
document together with

770
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,720
this agreement we had two other

771
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,200
documents one of them was the srv6

772
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,560
mobile proof of concept

773
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,560
where we were documenting several

774
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,599
implementations and

775
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,800
proof of concepts for this work

776
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,280
which at the end we just ended up

777
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,640
parking that document and we brought the

778
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,760
implementation part as an appendix to

779
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,119
this document

780
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,040
and then we had another document which

781
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,000
is the mobility use cases

782
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,400
where we started documenting the dsrv6

783
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,280
use cases in the mobile network

784
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,040
but at the end there was not a lot of

785
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
traction within the working group to get

786
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,960
them documented so the document in that

787
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,320
target as well next slide please

788
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,920
um okay so since singapore

789
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,560
what have been the changes well in

790
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
revision seven we added the drop in

791
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,040
interworking mode um which was the the

792
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,240
poc that our smith did for us

793
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,560
um and revisionaid it was just a pure

794
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,760
refresh on the document

795
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,079
um then at that time the working group

796
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,440
chairs asked

797
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,680
to get some reviewers to the document um

798
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,440
and carlos jesus

799
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,440
um reviewed the document many thanks

800
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,000
carlos so we in revision nine we updated

801
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,800
it to address the documents from carlos

802
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,079
arbition 10 which

803
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,640
was just posted right before this itf it

804
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,760
just has a few

805
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,040
typos and editorial verifications

806
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,800
next slide please

807
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,839
um then from our technology status point

808
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,880
of view

809
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,440
um there were two pocs which were

810
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,200
previously discussed on this

811
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,720
working group um so a sprint uh did one

812
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,400
project which was using

813
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,440
encore um where they actually were

814
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,800
capable of demonstrating this

815
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,359
srv6 mobile user plane um so that was

816
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,720
slide steam

817
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,800
and then we also had the poc that was

818
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,440
actually presented a few eight years ago

819
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,160
from arasmit leveraging the opener

820
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,560
interface

821
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,480
aside from that we also have two other

822
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,000
open source implementations

823
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
one in fdi of bvp contributed by tessuya

824
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,599
many thanks and then we have a p4

825
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,040
implementation

826
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,079
um that is also available open source

827
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,280
uh from contarusan nexus live please

828
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,560
um so the document has been stable

829
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,839
for the last two years

830
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:35,920
this document actually had a normative

831
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,280
reference on the

832
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
spring document on the srv6 network

833
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,200
programming draft

834
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,240
which has been approved on january this

835
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,040
year

836
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,440
um so given that the document has been

837
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,960
stable there are no

838
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,000
significant changes um

839
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,839
and we have the implementations i think

840
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,560
that it would be the right time to

841
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,520
move forward this document thank you

842
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,119
thank you pablo any questions comments

843
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,240
i have one comment yeah please order

844
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,839
some

845
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,960
um rfc 8986

846
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,119
open the behavior call point for survey

847
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,000
six and

848
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,560
this document defines several uh

849
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
established behavior

850
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,760
i think before working group last call

851
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,839
codepoint allocation will be better

852
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,079
okay can you repeat the last few words

853
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,359
please sorry um

854
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,240
asking ayanna to allocate the basic

855
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,920
behavior code point

856
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,359
okay it's being rc8986

857
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,720
already open the code point speaker

858
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,520
sure thank you

859
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,240
any other comments questions

860
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,680
okay thank you pablo yeah oh sorry

861
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,599
was there a comment i had my hand up i

862
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,920
was going to ask a question and then uh

863
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,160
i thought for a brief moment uh saturday

864
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,359
was reading my mind but

865
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,920
uh now i have to respond to that as well

866
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,040
um

867
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,359
i on an early allocation uh i think it's

868
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,359
rfc 7120

869
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,359
it's something we could do but i i think

870
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,520
maybe it's um

871
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,800
i was wondering the question i was going

872
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,520
to ask before that was uh has

873
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
has spring reviewed this document and

874
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,119
does anybody think that

875
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,760
document the spring should be notified

876
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,720
um

877
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,280
about this or at least notified during

878
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,319
the

879
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,480
dmm groups last call or

880
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,359
i i think uh you know i believe authors

881
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,280
very early did present this in spring

882
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,079
i'll let them confirm that but uh

883
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,960
at least from the content that we have i

884
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,160
do not know eric

885
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,960
if we need any explicit feedback but as

886
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,000
an fyi

887
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,599
just to see if there are any objections

888
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,680
we can certainly do that

889
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,000
maybe you know if you in any capacity if

890
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,760
you can forward that that will be great

891
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,720
otherwise

892
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,599
we can do that as well yes i think it's

893
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,880
our basic behavior

894
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,599
code point is our first confessor so i

895
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,720
don't think we need

896
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,680
the view from the spring

897
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,359
okay i haven't checked the registry

898
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:18,640
there

899
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,839
just one comment so um on the first

900
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,599
revisions of the document went into us

901
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,119
an individual document

902
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,319
um we did send it to to a spring

903
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,960
um and indeed dmm choose to adopt it

904
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,560
because we were hesitating between a

905
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
spring and dmm um

906
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,280
for the last couple of revisions the

907
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,119
document has not been forwarded to a

908
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,079
spring

909
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,480
um so certainly eric maybe one

910
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,839
interesting thing that we could do is

911
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,359
whenever the document goes into working

912
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,480
group last fall

913
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,960
maybe we can cross post it uh to both

914
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,640
the spring and dmm

915
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,200
if you think that would be helpful for

916
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,880
or we could send it for review earlier

917
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
to spring whatever

918
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,839
anything work either one of those things

919
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,560
i think would be

920
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:04,240
uh polite for spring folks

921
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,440
um and uh i'll i'll

922
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,560
i'll talk to the spring ad

923
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,240
about early allocation if you want

924
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,280
okay thank you okay so so uh

925
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,000
eric to close the ai uh are you going to

926
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,359
forward the document or

927
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,720
