1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,480
good morning

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
good

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,000
okay with uh

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,080
at the start of our slot so we only have

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,359
like one hour so

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,119
you know maybe let's get started there

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,920
so you have landed into the lsvr working

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,640
group

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,000
and uh we have a few interesting topics

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
here now before we start

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
let me see if my slides actually work

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
okay

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
so we don't need the scribe thing

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,520
because we have the scribe automatically

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,120
building into the tool nowadays which is

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,559
very handy

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,520
uh if there are like any minutes then

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,160
you know

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,440
please feel free to use the menu tab you

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,039
know on top of the

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
uh meet echo screen you don't have to do

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,879
this you know just by yourself we can

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,320
actually all do this together so that's

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,040
very hands

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,200
handful you know very handy and very

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,479
convenient

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,240
so that would be appreciated uh next is

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,159
you have seen this note well already a

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,680
few times because we're already on the

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
second day

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
if any questions you know please be

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,320
aware of this

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,799
then the agenda bashing so what we have

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,000
on the agenda at this point

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
in time is uh three topics three main

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,000
topics here

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
uh first we're gonna get like an l3dl

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,079
uh status update then we're gonna have

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,799
uh paul speaking a bit about ldpv2 which

40
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,920
is you know

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,960
what is happening in the ieee from that

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,079
perspective

43
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,240
then we're going to be discussing the

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,079
announcements and the progress

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,840
around the bgp spf

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,079
itself and see where we are and then we

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,360
are going to be closing

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,479
so where are we within the in our

49
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,840
working group here so

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
we have sent two documents towards the

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
id the id

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
reviewed it and actually you know send

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,720
it back but you know together when

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
sending it back he actually sent

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
you know it back with like a thousand

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,000
one pages of feedback

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,879
which uh the authors have been working

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,959
upon very intensively you know over the

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,720
new year's period

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,599
until now and ac is going to give like

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,120
uh

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
an update on where we are at this point

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,080
in time with these particular drafts

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
now in the meantime also last month we

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,680
have done a working

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
working group last call on the l3dl

67
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,319
documents uh

68
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,879
while no major concerns were erased you

69
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,560
know there was also not really a lot of

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
feedback on that so you know we need to

71
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,680
figure out how to deal with that going

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,720
forward

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,959
now that being said there is another

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,560
element playing also

75
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,480
and that has to do with the fact that

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,040
l3dl is a little bit out of scope

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
from our shorter so

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,159
what we are thinking about doing is to

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,760
reshorted the working group

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,959
uh by explicitly adding the l3dl

81
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,040
components into the charter itself

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,879
which would give us you know a better

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
foundation to keep

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
progressing on this particular

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,599
technology going

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,640
forward and that being said you know

87
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,239
for in an effort for

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,200
trying to enhance the feedback required

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
you know feedback requested

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,840
and reviews requested for these

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,239
documents i'll also be

92
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
you know launching a call on the working

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
group email alias

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
for some volunteers to actually give

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,239
feedback on this on these documents

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,480
uh just you know more discussions on

97
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
that going forward

98
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
you have anything to add on this victor

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,599
it pretty much covers it all right now

100
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,200
that covers it from my perspective as

101
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,720
well

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,400
okay so yeah i already talked about the

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,159
dietary please status

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,319
element here which paul is going to give

105
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,518
us an update about

106
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,599
so going back to the agenda any

107
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
anybody wants to add or change something

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,040
on here

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,918
at this point in time if not i think

110
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,199
then we're going to be starting with the

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,959
first session and the first slot from

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,440
randy

113
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
okay so let me pull up the slice for

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
randy

115
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
uh voila

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,840
so randy if you can push the microphone

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
button then

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,520
the floor or the worldwide internet is

119
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,320
all yours

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
at this point you think well i could

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,759
only use this very small

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,720
portion of the internet

123
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,080
um okay this

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
sue um raised an issue

125
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,160
by a private email which was interesting

126
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,199
um but first just a little bit more on

127
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,919
status

128
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,039
is the documents the three

129
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
l3 tl documents passed

130
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,759
within the class call with

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,960
as gutter said light feedback

132
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,680
but um you should be aware that also

133
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,960
that

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,680
rob is contemplating

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,440
upgrading updating the lsoe

136
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
open source implementation to

137
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,400
l3dl so that kind of wraps the status

138
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,639
so sue raised an issue

139
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,680
about the hello

140
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,840
pdu possibly causing a layer 2

141
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,359
storm next slide please

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,160
if you remember the hello is a multicast

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,360
layer 2 pdu being sent

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,960
from a device who wakes up and

145
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,160
is seeking friendship there are

146
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,840
two forms the pdu can take one

147
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,280
is that first mac which

148
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,800
is stopped dead at the nearest bridge

149
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,680
by layer two rules

150
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,000
okay

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,759
if just in case there's an intermediate

152
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,160
switch

153
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,759
we specified a

154
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,840
to be assigned mac

155
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,120
that will pierce an intermediate switch

156
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,639
because by layer two rules when a switch

157
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,960
receives a frame with a multicast

158
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,080
desk that doesn't recognize it forwards

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,240
okay so the second one

160
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,000
is to be used when you know you're

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
connected to a switch

162
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,840
next slide please

163
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
so the document says that that

164
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,800
hello should be repeated at a configured

165
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,840
interval by the default of 60 seconds so

166
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
when the device wakes up it should find

167
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
its friends

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,599
within a mean of 30 seconds and a max of

169
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
60 seconds

170
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,759
but it further warns that if you're in

171
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,879
the multi-link scenario in other words

172
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
you're allowing for intermediate

173
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
switches

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,440
be aware of a trade-off between the

175
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,759
timer tuning

176
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,879
and network noise and maybe tune the

177
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,080
timer up or down

178
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
accordingly but

179
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,479
sue raised a further issue next slide

180
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,878
please

181
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
next slide please

182
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
so i've stolen her artwork sue do you

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,240
want to

184
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
um walk through the storm or shall i do

185
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,319
it i think everybody

186
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,479
knows what a way or two storm is like so

187
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,879
we can breeze through the storm as it

188
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,520
were

189
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
or we could if you've got the patience

190
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,639
you can take us through it

191
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,039
you might sound by not

192
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,399
um that means because they need to

193
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,240
enable me

194
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,920
did you get me can you hear me gotcha

195
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,320
yes okay i would go through the brief

196
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,720
because if people understand multicast

197
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,080
storms

198
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,519
this may be a simple issue uh

199
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,519
if the brief doesn't make it we'll go

200
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,720
through the more

201
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,839
lengthy approach

202
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,560
so uh folks the diagram i'll explain and

203
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,519
then i'm gonna let

204
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,000
randy go through the discussion because

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
he tends to be a bit

206
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,640
briefer than i the concept is you don't

207
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,200
have the topology described

208
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,160
in the document okay and randy will go

209
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,880
through it

210
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
but you have this more interconnected

211
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,839
switch topology how you got there

212
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,600
not my problem uh perhaps it's recon

213
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,959
errors and so this is

214
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,080
the aero topology note i realize it is

215
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,640
not a standard class topology it would

216
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,839
be created by

217
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,120
air or by something else

218
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,399
so randy why don't um

219
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,480
why don't you go ahead or i can explain

220
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,440
the next step

221
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,640
it's fine so essentially the routers

222
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,680
the things labeled routers

223
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,040
are l3dl speakers the things

224
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,240
not labeled routers the little square

225
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
cubes

226
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,279
oops that's bad the little cubes are

227
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,800
switches whereas if you use the

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
multicast

229
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,760
to be assigned

230
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,640
multicast packets will go not only

231
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,440
through them but

232
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
it will as it receives one

233
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,519
next slide please it will

234
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,959
re-announce it okay you see the

235
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,680
multicast hello coming up from router a

236
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,000
and

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
switch one re-announcing app on all

238
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,880
its other interfaces next slide please

239
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,399
those other destinations generously do

240
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,839
similarly

241
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,079
and we can see more pretty colored

242
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,760
little boxes multiplying

243
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,519
the network next slide please

244
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
those in turn

245
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
echo back now what was fun here

246
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,519
is that

247
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,120
because the echoes

248
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,200
caused regeneration they

249
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
go back they're allowed to come back

250
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,440
through the mesh

251
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,240
and are even worse next slide please

252
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
so i think you see where this is going

253
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,839
if anybody

254
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
wants more detail on layer two storms

255
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
feel free to hit your mic button

256
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,120
hi bill

257
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,200
bill hi you have a

258
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,519
layer two network without spanning tree

259
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,639
but with loops

260
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,360
like how do you get to this point where

261
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,680
the switches are flooding

262
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,719
and creating a storm

263
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
that's a good point this is an edge case

264
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,560
bill

265
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,680
the spanning tree is most likely not

266
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,800
running

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
you would have some interconnections

268
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,639
that are

269
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,320
are um normal

270
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,200
so as i started out in the beginning

271
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,680
this

272
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,440
broadcast storm only works with the

273
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,920
compine

274
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,760
with a set of edge cases

275
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
okay you don't have something that's

276
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,880
living

277
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,480
running a spanning tree you're using

278
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,320
uh the multicast transmission which goes

279
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,200
through switches

280
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,959
and then redistributes widely

281
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,760
um paul i don't know if this is even

282
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,279
possible

283
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,959
just just bill let me see if i can

284
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,399
cut to the chase here excuse the spoiler

285
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
the final scene of the movie is this

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
isn't our envision topology in this

287
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,240
working group

288
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
this isn't a club and there's tons of

289
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
intermediate switches which we don't

290
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,680
envision

291
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,040
envisions ls are

292
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,399
enabled device ls vo

293
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,760
to enable devices all on link to link

294
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,880
just in case but we can move forward let

295
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,680
me move forward

296
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
next slide please i think we also have

297
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,399
paul actually in the line here

298
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,760
yeah i just was gonna echo kind of what

299
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
bill said we have it

300
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,680
obviously kind of an invalid layer two

301
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,199
topology here there's

302
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,279
besides multi-caps there would be other

303
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,399
flooded packets

304
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,959
that were not learned yet or various

305
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,079
things so

306
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,160
i also wanted to point out spanning

307
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,519
trees not your only

308
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,519
topology management protocol at layer

309
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,600
two there's other approaches including

310
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
software defined networking things or as

311
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,240
well as shortest path bridging

312
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,800
and so to make this work there must be

313
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,399
some kind of loop free topology

314
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,600
management

315
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
going on that would prevent this i mean

316
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,720
my pope my point is i don't want to make

317
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,279
it work

318
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,040
i don't think we're interested in it but

319
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,480
we'll i'll get there in a minute next

320
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,880
slide please

321
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
okay one

322
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,399
approach aside from as paul and

323
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,480
fenron point out on trying to use

324
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,199
standard layer 2 damping tools is do we

325
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,199
add a nonce

326
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,320
no nice try because the p naughts would

327
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
be recognized by those non-l3dl speakers

328
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,440
so the storm would propagate next slide

329
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
please

330
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
but isn't this isn't our model

331
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,839
okay we don't have a model with all

332
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,680
these switches with this

333
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,360
dumb switch mesh next slide please

334
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,199
our model is a club

335
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,560
a standard clothed fabric and they're

336
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
all 3dl speakers

337
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,800
next slide please at worst

338
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,720
we might have a switch that wants some

339
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,760
fan out

340
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,959
one stage which is why we stuck that

341
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,160
one form

342
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,199
of switch piercing

343
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,040
multicast mac okay

344
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,639
this isn't going to storm next slide

345
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,040
please

346
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,920
so do we actually have a problem

347
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,839
and that's the end

348
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,199
comments is because i think it's an edge

349
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,160
case

350
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,600
i didn't perceive anything

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,360
that really needed to be fixed after our

352
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,160
discussion

353
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,440
with randy and i

354
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,480
couldn't think of uh

355
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,839
of a shortest path bridging or normal

356
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
spanning tree

357
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,040
topology where this would actually apply

358
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,399
i

359
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,959
i just thought outside the box so i'll

360
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,880
leave this to bill and the rest

361
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
i didn't think there was a problem

362
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
because i don't think

363
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
the scenario i described

364
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,240
is something you would normally see now

365
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,079
that i've shared my

366
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,839
evil nightmare i'll let the rest of you

367
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,440
uh just um

368
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,759
there are other packets like broadcasts

369
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,519
that also need to be

370
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,120
um not uh

371
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
create a storm and multicast is just

372
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,599
another instance of this so

373
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,079
you need to have some mechanism spanning

374
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,119
tree or s

375
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,959
or as paul said there are many other

376
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,359
mechanisms in your layer two to prevent

377
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,640
storms it's not just

378
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,599
multicast that has this problem so to

379
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,079
have

380
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,199
a layer two like this is just to have an

381
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,880
invalid layer too

382
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,520
it's not just this particular multicast

383
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
that will have a problem it's broadcast

384
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,679
arps

385
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
it's unicast unlearned uh

386
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,039
flooding so i think the pro even though

387
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
even though we don't need this you know

388
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
we don't want to address this topology

389
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,320
because it's not a clo

390
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,679
we also don't want to address this

391
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,520
topology because it's just not a valid

392
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,080
layer too

393
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,760
to run over um

394
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,120
i agree first of all um

395
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,039
there's a hidden

396
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
issue here or desire here

397
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,240
which is over an idr they're discussing

398
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,960
bgp

399
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,720
discovery finding your friends

400
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,160
and their

401
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
immediate target is

402
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
the data center i don't

403
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,360
know if they are

404
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,919
limiting their definition of data center

405
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,840
to be

406
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,559
a clo

407
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
as far as i can tell they're in the

408
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,678
expansion and laundry list phase

409
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,559
but i think this probably

410
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,559
triggered the

411
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,039
oh my god what happens when there's all

412
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,240
these other devices here

413
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
one thing we could do is by the way

414
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,919
is ignore or actually prohibit the case

415
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,400
when there's an intermediate switch

416
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,679
and remove that second form

417
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,640
of mac

418
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,400
i'm not advocating it i'm saying

419
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,080
you know that certainly shuts off this

420
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:24,160
possibility of discussion

421
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,799
so one of the things you know yeah i got

422
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,720
here

423
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
yeah i was just wondering about the fact

424
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,559
you know so if you look into the

425
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,320
layer 2 topology what we have here you

426
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
know it's a little bit illegal because

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,120
it represents a layer 2 environment

428
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
without you know a spanning tree or you

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,960
know

430
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,799
some sort of a protocol to do you know

431
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,000
to manage the

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
multicast and broadcast floating within

433
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,679
the environment which is a little bit

434
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,919
i think illegal it will give problems

435
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,440
always so

436
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
i think we should you know to me we

437
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,559
should

438
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,200
the l3dl should support like multi

439
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,760
levels of you know of of switches

440
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,520
but we should have a floating mechanisms

441
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
you know that should be uh you know

442
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
a requirement i think if we if that

443
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,159
actually happens it should not be

444
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
not what i'm thinking

445
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,120
um i think

446
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,520
everybody's discussed the fact that that

447
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,200
topology is not something you want to

448
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,679
write home to mother about

449
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,960
but that last statement you made is that

450
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,440
l3dl

451
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,880
should support multiplayer

452
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
switching topology properly configured

453
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,600
of course

454
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,000
is that really a target for lsvr

455
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,520
and i'm asking you as chair

456
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,159
from lsvr i don't think that is the case

457
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:46,720
but

458
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,840
then again i think l3dl you know

459
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
is a technology which could be used

460
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
potentially beyond you know the lsvr use

461
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,480
cases so i don't you know i think if we

462
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,320
constrain it too far in the

463
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,919
applicability

464
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,679
at this point in time then in a later

465
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,360
phase we will have to do you know

466
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,400
more r d research to expand

467
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,480
you know the use case from it ah

468
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
paul yeah i was going to respond to your

469
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
comment about maybe not

470
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
using the um address that

471
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
passes through switches and using one

472
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,760
that terminates at switches

473
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,200
like lldp might and

474
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
there's probably a couple of ways that

475
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
you could do that

476
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,760
first of all in 802.1 we do have regis

477
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,080
attribute registration protocols that

478
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,919
allow you to

479
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,640
propagate information like who my

480
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
neighbor might be or something about

481
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,679
somebody

482
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
across the network like that you showed

483
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,159
uh without flooding and without you know

484
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,919
without causing the storm

485
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,520
so there's there are separate

486
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,360
registration protocols that could be

487
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,080
leveraged

488
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,679
but perhaps even easier would be to

489
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,919
to find your own like higher layer

490
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,520
entity that propagates information

491
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,919
using um you know hop by hop kind of

492
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
methodology so in other words we do this

493
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,159
in lldp as well you you

494
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,559
you may receive uh some information on

495
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,840
one link

496
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,520
and then you generate an entirely

497
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,440
another packet rather than just using

498
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
the forwarding plane you use the

499
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,000
software plane

500
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
you generate another one that goes out

501
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,120
the other links

502
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,840
um that sort of propagates that

503
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,520
information so

504
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,080
you could conceivably build some higher

505
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,440
layer

506
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,320
uh entity when i say higher layer i mean

507
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,679
above layer two

508
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
so um you know some software forwarder

509
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,520
so to speak

510
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,840
that that just regenerated the l3dl

511
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,360
information

512
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,600
and sent it in a whole new packet rather

513
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
than just flooding it so anyway just a

514
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,559
couple of thoughts there's

515
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,400
there's possible ways i think you could

516
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,840
do what you were proposing randy

517
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,200
hi randy uh jeff has juniper

518
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,760
the the point from the auto conf i

519
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
suspect was the genesis for this

520
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,640
conversation

521
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,799
but i think it probably still impacts

522
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,280
health lsvr as well

523
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,440
the observation that we'd left in the

524
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,760
documents that we did for auto conf

525
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,159
is yet to figure out what is the scope

526
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,320
of the thing you want to talk to

527
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
in this case we're talking about l2 and

528
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,559
i think you've nailed

529
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,600
the point perfectly fine that if you

530
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,279
use something that goes beyond the scope

531
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,880
of the thing i'm talking to at the end

532
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,919
of this wire

533
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,360
to a broader domain if you have a mis

534
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,640
wiring in your network

535
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,360
it's potentially problematic i'm not

536
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,479
saying that you should solve that

537
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,760
and some some operators have told us one

538
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,360
of the things they like about this

539
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,158
is it might help them detect miswires

540
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,880
sorry no i i agree with you

541
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
um it's one of the things i do like

542
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,880
about l3dl is that

543
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
it's good plumbing to extend for a lot

544
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:21,919
of

545
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600
things including this use case

546
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,159
i think that we both realize that if

547
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,559
that is part of the core use case

548
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,919
a little bit of additional machinery

549
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,760
needs to be added to the protocol

550
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,919
gladly discussed

551
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,720
thank you

552
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,200
my forward proposal at the moment

553
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,520
is this is not our problem in l3

554
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,639
and ls we are

555
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,559
if people over in idr want to

556
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,960
use l3dl certainly we can discuss it

557
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,840
with them

558
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,919
somebody feel free to whack me on that

559
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,520
okay then i'm done okay cool

560
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,559
thank you thank you randy so let's jump

561
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,919
to the next one i think this is going to

562
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,240
be

563
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,799
paul now

564
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,120
so instead of five minutes you actually

565
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,080
have 10 minutes well

566
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,279
okay i i'm assuming you can hear me okay

567
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,000
yep um yeah so it's been a while since

568
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,559
we've

569
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,720
given you an update on what we call

570
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,520
project 802.1 abdh

571
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,320
um which we we call in 802.1x

572
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,080
lldp but we've talked in the past about

573
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,760
it being called sort of lldp version

574
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,840
uh and the main the main objective here

575
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,919
was to allow us to send

576
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,799
more information in lldp than can

577
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,520
typically fit in a single frame

578
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
uh but do that in a way that is backward

579
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,440
compatible

580
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,400
so it uh i i have some uh well first of

581
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,640
all

582
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
we have an editor uh who's been

583
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,919
developing the draft uh

584
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,919
steve haddock you may or may not know

585
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,919
him he's been around for quite a while

586
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,960
excellent editor uh and the pro the

587
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
draft has made quite a bit of progress

588
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,240
and sort of getting to the

589
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,200
sign of final stages if you will so next

590
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,919
slide

591
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,200
um because first of all this

592
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,679
is a an individual contribution this is

593
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,760
not an official kind of quote liaison or

594
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,640
anything from

595
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,080
ieee 802. this is just me however if

596
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,440
if lsvr was interested we could

597
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,679
do uh something a little more formal in

598
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,760
terms of document sharing and those kind

599
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,559
of things so making it possible for

600
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,000
uh you know your lsvr group to

601
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
you know comment vote whatever on the

602
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,200
documents

603
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,080
we're typically very liberal about

604
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,520
accepting comments from

605
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,840
from anybody anyway uh in the earliest

606
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,840
phases once you get to the final final

607
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,880
phase

608
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,200
uh then of course it's a things are

609
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
processed a little bit more tight but in

610
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,559
general we're

611
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
open for comment so yeah next one

612
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,520
um so briefly this is the

613
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
uh i didn't want to get into i don't

614
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,960
have you know in five or ten minutes

615
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,240
still not enough to do a lot of

616
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,000
technical discussion here so there have

617
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,559
been

618
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,600
uh presentations in the past i point out

619
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,240
that the

620
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,640
the motivation for originally doing this

621
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,080
work came from

622
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,600
um looking at the requirements that ls

623
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,039
l3dl was satisfying uh and trying to see

624
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,440
if

625
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,080
it was time to update lldp it's a widely

626
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
used protocol

627
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,880
there were a lot of people that have

628
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
augmented it or added additional

629
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,840
information

630
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,679
and it really pushed the boundaries when

631
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,360
it only allowed you to send a single

632
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,960
frame

633
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,080
so the l3dl motivation helped kick us

634
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,320
off into this new project in general so

635
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,600
there's some background

636
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,000
presentations here and again last time

637
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,880
we did an update was itf 106.

638
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,799
but nothing really has technically

639
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,960
changed since then

640
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,279
um i've just got some references to

641
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,080
pointers for

642
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
the project page and then the project

643
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,240
scope and those kinds of things you're

644
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,679
welcome to read

645
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,240
uh and then more recently the the sort

646
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,080
of technical contributions

647
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,200
um as steve haddock came in and became

648
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
editor he had

649
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,320
a couple of questions and he noted a few

650
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,120
things

651
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,559
we had resolved those those are

652
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,159
discussed in here

653
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,960
uh and uh there's a paper written by

654
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,000
myself and

655
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,440
paul bottom who kind of goes into really

656
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,559
more of the details that's the

657
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,919
fundamentals for the

658
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,039
for the uh the draft so feel free to

659
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,399
take a look at those i think those are

660
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,880
all publicly available documents

661
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,679
uh next slide

662
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
so since the last uh the status and

663
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,760
since the last ietf

664
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,240
um we've completed what we call the

665
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
working group ballot first working your

666
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,799
ballot

667
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,679
and that was very recently completed

668
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,360
it's kind of roughly equivalent to an

669
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,000
ietf last call

670
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,960
and we're resolving those comments now

671
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,360
uh

672
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,640
this week as unfortunately ietf and ieee

673
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,200
overlapped at the same time so made

674
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
difficult to attend both

675
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,600
but really the changes are we put all

676
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,679
the content into the format

677
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,440
of a standard we that draft is complete

678
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
with all the normative texts and state

679
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,720
machines and

680
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,080
conformance we're using this xlvp

681
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,120
terminology to to express the extension

682
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,240
of lldp it's not necessarily a version

683
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,880
two because

684
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,760
what's important is that a version one

685
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,520
implementation that's probably already

686
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,559
running in the network

687
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,399
is capable of communicating with the

688
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,320
version 2

689
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,279
but obviously only the first pdu's worth

690
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,279
of information

691
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,919
but in that pdu we we defined a new

692
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,120
a new tlv that basically describes a set

693
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,880
of extensions

694
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
um and uh and all that information

695
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
allows you to send up the

696
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,120
like 64 or more pdus worth of

697
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,240
of data and one

698
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,399
technical thing that came up lldp

699
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,279
supports the

700
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
concept of uh multiple agents per

701
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
interface

702
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,600
and really there's different scope in l2

703
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,200
networks you might have

704
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
provider bridges or provider backbone

705
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,640
bridges which are

706
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,520
kind of layers of layer two if you will

707
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:55,919
and

708
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,159
we want to be able to communicate lldp

709
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,039
messages

710
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,840
between different endpoints across that

711
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,799
layer to topology and so there was some

712
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,320
there's some trickiness in how that

713
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,399
works but we made some clarification of

714
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,080
that in the standard so

715
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,600
it's always been there it's not new

716
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,679
support it's just when we

717
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,039
added xldp uh

718
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,600
capability it got a little bit more

719
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,320
interesting

720
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,399
so um next time

721
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,919
so the next steps is again we're

722
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,919
resolving comments on uh

723
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,279
thursday i guess it is this week um and

724
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,399
then we'll have what we call

725
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
recirculation ballot

726
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,200
if that passes then it goes to uh what

727
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,880
we call standards association ballot

728
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,919
which is kind of

729
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,840
you know the equivalent of the end of

730
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
the road uh

731
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,120
and um what would be great is to see an

732
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,039
open source implementation you know the

733
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,600
current

734
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,000
lldp open source implementation would be

735
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,360
would be great to see that

736
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,480
augmented to support this um

737
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,279
and then like i mentioned early on if

738
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,559
there's a desire

739
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,200
we can do some liaison and document

740
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,519
sharing with lsvr if

741
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,080
if that's of interest we can take that

742
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,799
offline

743
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,200
to to roll those wheels so if anybody's

744
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,559
interested in doing that

745
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,559
so anyway that's that's really the

746
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,320
update um if there's any questions

747
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,200
happy to take those

748
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,080
thank you paul any questions at all

749
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,600
if not then we're going to go to the

750
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
next uh

751
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,840
slot i think ac

752
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,240
yeah no this isn't just a question it's

753
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,919
ac linden cisco i want to say that i

754
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,799
think this is a good work uh

755
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,039
i'm hoping i recommended that cisco

756
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,480
support this even though i'm not

757
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,919
active in the ieee so i'm hoping that

758
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,159
happened

759
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,720
uh yeah we did get your support to make

760
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,519
it all happen

761
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,840
thank you

762
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
thank you

763
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,919
all right randy helen

764
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,360
i did uh come over to ieee and try to

765
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,159
help and join this and nothing much was

766
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,519
happening

767
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,480
if things are spinning up again i again

768
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,279
volunteer

769
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,080
to help

770
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,960
okay let me know how

771
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,679
we make that happen i can uh i'll bring

772
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,679
that back to the group and mention

773
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,480
somehow we can as an individual work you

774
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,039
in or

775
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,440
or again we can do a more official

776
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,720
cooperation i'm just

777
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,919
an old hippie engineer so you can wrap

778
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,600
whatever you want around it

779
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,200
um but email works well

780
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,519
okay

781
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,280
okay that's it okay let me get the last

782
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,239
section to the last button

783
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,638
voila

784
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,760
okay here we go let me

785
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,639
adjust here good morning everyone

786
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,879
i'm going to be presenting one thing uh

787
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,000
i'm only good

788
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,040
we we well both documents went back to

789
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,480
the working group

790
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,359
we focused on the protocol document with

791
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,280
updates we were doing

792
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,760
uh during uh starting about thanksgiving

793
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,599
care victor and i met weekly and

794
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,960
and went through the comments actually

795
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,399
as gunther said there are a lot of

796
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,320
comments i think the the comments

797
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,760
plus the inline draft greatly exceeded

798
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,119
the size of the original draft

799
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,680
so there was a we spent uh quite a bit

800
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,200
of time on this

801
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
on the first document the reason we

802
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,599
didn't look at the apple

803
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,480
applicability yet is because

804
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,839
uh why don't you go to the next slide

805
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,640
because the applicability uh

806
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,680
will be impacted by the change the the

807
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,560
protocol

808
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
in a lot of places when we first did

809
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
this we thought something with bgp

810
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,200
we said yeah we could do this with bgp

811
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,240
spf

812
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,599
but we took out all those things that

813
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,560
we could do but didn't fully specify

814
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,320
because we wanted to have a nice

815
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,520
tight core protocol that could that can

816
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,160
be

817
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,359
augmented with future uh giraffes

818
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,440
to do more things with it uh

819
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,839
a lot of the comments these are just

820
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,960
things we did we

821
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,440
beefed up the error handling

822
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,640
we added the security section with the

823
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,000
parts of it that are relevant to bgp

824
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,040
spf we

825
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,160
clarified the relationship to bd

826
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,359
bgpls and uh

827
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,200
you know in addition we've always had

828
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,599
the separate address family but we

829
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,560
clarified that

830
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,960
clarified which um

831
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,920
nrli and which uh attributes we were

832
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,440
specifically using

833
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,359
in the base protocol and we also

834
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,119
um also like i said we eliminated things

835
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,200
in bgp that we said

836
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,160
you know you know uh like for instance

837
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,599
uh

838
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,079
route optimized route reflection we took

839
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,520
that out completely

840
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,400
we took out uh some of the other

841
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,280
discussions

842
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,720
of 55 49 next tops and things like that

843
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,480
and i rewrote the or we rewrote the spf

844
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,440
section

845
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,760
and used consistent terminology

846
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,119
throughout

847
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,720
i think i think it's a lot easier i mean

848
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,160
it would be

849
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,079
uh there were actually some mistakes in

850
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,680
it too and once we did that

851
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,560
so i know the implementations must i

852
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,640
hope the implementations just said oh i

853
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,599
we know it we know what it what he means

854
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,599
not or what what the draft means

855
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,320
not what it says and some other minor

856
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,480
nets

857
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,040
next slide

858
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,400
yeah most the changes were

859
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,200
clarifications and things that should

860
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,280
have been you know where we

861
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,480
underspecified

862
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,520
there are weren't a lot of changes to

863
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,720
the protocol other than the error

864
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,839
handling i mean that

865
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,880
that really really crisp that up because

866
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,480
he's familiar with all the different the

867
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,000
evolution of error handling

868
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,920
in bgp complete with uh

869
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,520
the um the draft i forget the number of

870
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,040
it that tells what you do

871
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,480
uh when you whether you ignore

872
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,280
uh an attribute and continue or whether

873
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,920
you

874
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,960
whether you uh take it as an implicit

875
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,480
withdrawal

876
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,960
or bring down the session we tried to

877
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,359
stay away from that last one of course

878
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,000
and uh we put in the uh

879
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,040
the code points used by the arcus

880
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,400
implementation

881
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,599
into the ant ayana section and have

882
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,800
requested early allocation of those

883
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
next slide

884
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
now this is really the key point there

885
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
were a number of things

886
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,000
we didn't put in yet but i think

887
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,839
most of them are closed we inherited

888
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,440
because we used bgp

889
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,800
ls nrli we kind we pretty much

890
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,160
inherited that you're going to be

891
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,800
limited to one nrli

892
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,240
per update because

893
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
conceivably you could have a bunch of

894
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,480
prefixes that all have the same

895
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,680
metric all the same attributes uh

896
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,680
but if once you start like that if if

897
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,359
anything ever changes you'd have to keep

898
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,560
them together because of the sequence

899
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,000
number everything so

900
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,960
i think we're going to go ahead and say

901
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,839
really

902
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,960
you really really only can have one nroi

903
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,560
per update

904
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,839
i'm going to go to i'm going to do

905
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,400
initial synchronization last

906
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,839
the next top requirement okay or

907
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,040
crisp that up so it follows the 4760

908
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
rules and i think this issue is closed

909
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,079
completely

910
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,160
and the single session requirement this

911
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,400
was from melbaro but

912
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,800
we he said he said are you limiting it

913
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,079
to a single

914
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,920
uh a a a separate session for bgpls

915
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,359
and the other address families and we

916
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,440
can take that we think we're just going

917
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,880
to verify this on the list we don't

918
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,320
think it needs to be

919
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,480
so we're not going to do this okay let

920
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,000
me go back to the key one that we're

921
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,520
going to discuss this is the initial

922
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,359
synchronization

923
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,599
what alvaro brought up which is a really

924
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,119
good point is the

925
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,640
igps at least ospf uh has

926
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,760
a you know you don't advertise

927
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,359
a neighbor until you have synchronized

928
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,119
with that neighbor or the link that it's

929
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,240
you know you know

930
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,319
that you're connected over that link to

931
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,640
that neighbor now

932
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,160
uh we'll have we're going to add some

933
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,760
discussions of this

934
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,040
i guess isis has a a similar thing that

935
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,400
you don't advertise but it's not

936
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,480
mandatory in isis i forget the name of

937
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,520
the

938
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,880
the bit in the

939
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,200
in uh isis hellos but anyway um

940
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,280
we're going to discuss that further on

941
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,359
the list the one thing

942
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,400
that i was thinking this is just me i

943
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,520
haven't even

944
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,359
talked to my co-authors about this is

945
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,880
maybe

946
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,440
we could push the route reflector case

947
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,200
out or the controller case

948
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,119
you know talk about that what you could

949
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,680
do or whether your mileage will vary or

950
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,480
whatever

951
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,040
so that's what's coming next slide

952
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,800
like i said we're gonna we we did one

953
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,319
working group last call we're gonna do

954
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:15,760
another once we get this done we'll

955
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,280
start working you know once

956
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,119
now that we know we've sort of scoped

957
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,800
the base protocol

958
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,920
down to what we've fully specified

959
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,720
we're going to work on the applicability

960
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,200
as well

961
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,040
and there are now multiple

962
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,520
implementations there's a there's arcus

963
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,000
and one

964
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,960
underway for uh with for free range

965
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,280
routing

966
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,119
comments

967
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:51,440
hello

968
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,560
uh hey guys good morning um albert

969
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,640
athana um

970
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
uh futureware technologies i guess

971
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,720
speaking as a individual

972
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,440
working group participant at this time

973
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,280
um i just want to

974
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,079
i guess if we go back to the last slide

975
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:08,400
the

976
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,440
slide before this one um

977
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,599
insist a little bit on the separate

978
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,480
session

979
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,119
requirement or maybe not requirement

980
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,040
considerations

981
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,319
because um

982
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,520
not only are we carrying different

983
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,040
information inside of bgp session but

984
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,319
we're making decisions based on

985
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,520
different things

986
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,359
meaning running spf here versus the

987
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,079
decision process in 4271.

988
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,560
so the potential dynamics of how the

989
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,839
updates get distributed around the

990
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,640
network are different from a normal

991
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,359
by php session to a bgp spf session

992
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,400
so if the working group so i would

993
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,280
you know i'll obviously uh really want

994
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,240
to see

995
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,359
a requirement for software session

996
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,480
but what i would settle for is

997
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,680
if we could include a draft um you know

998
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,359
some considerations around you know what

999
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,119
things um could happen you know what

1000
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,280
what things to look at in the network

1001
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,960
uh i don't know congruent topologies

1002
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,359
things along those lines

1003
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,960
just the individual contribution

1004
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,359
i'm gonna know that i see carriers in

1005
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,119
the queue i'm gonna let him

1006
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,480
talk to that one super uh

1007
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,440
first of all uh cave patel's uh arkis i

1008
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,880
was gonna say cisco

1009
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,560
uh following ac

1010
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,000
patella one thing i wanted to uh

1011
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,880
first acknowledge was that it was a

1012
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,960
fantastic feedback from

1013
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,440
alvaro um on the draft uh we couldn't

1014
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,800
have asked for more

1015
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,000
um and so thank you on that particularly

1016
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,040
on a single a single and a separate

1017
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,839
session requirement

1018
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,119
to me we could certainly add some text

1019
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,119
in the draft but

1020
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,760
this is also somewhat an implementation

1021
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,800
uh

1022
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,319
detail in sense that today certain bgp

1023
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,119
implementations do allow you to run

1024
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,880
multiple processes

1025
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,920
wherein you can listen on a different uh

1026
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,200
ports uh over and above 179. so

1027
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,400
you could definitely fork this

1028
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,520
implementation of some different port

1029
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,520
where you could listen on to

1030
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,680
and then it would automatically be a

1031
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,839
completely separate session

1032
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,200
so whether you want to do that or not

1033
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
is a very implementation specific

1034
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,400
details

1035
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,240
um a lot of people do it for a lot of

1036
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,599
different saffies

1037
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,359
and that's why i think we can add

1038
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,640
something in

1039
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,000
in draft as a loose text but we won't

1040
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,839
want to make it as a requirement

1041
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,800
thank you

1042
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,680
right the period i mean yeah you

1043
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,960
wouldn't want to have you you know

1044
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,240
especially if you're doing the purine

1045
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,160
model where you're using

1046
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,200
a session per uh

1047
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,760
per link you certainly wouldn't want to

1048
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,800
have a separate

1049
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,800
address for peering on two addresses

1050
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,400
to make them unique yeah the separate

1051
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,720
listener port would typically make that

1052
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,160
session completely

1053
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,759
yes yeah that'd be a better option

1054
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,800
thank you

1055
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,160
thank you uh

1056
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
i i know what he's asking i owe him a

1057
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,640
response on this

1058
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,680
oh i have a question that i found the

1059
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,119
from the job to

1060
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,359
version there are at a new chapter

1061
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:51,359
6.1.1

1062
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,640
this i think this is this this actually

1063
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:54,880
is

1064
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,920
like igp method but uh

1065
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,839
for bp obpa

1066
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,680
perhaps the s loop or maybe check may be

1067
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,560
used or other

1068
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,760
otherwise of the ordinate id may be used

1069
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,280
to identify the rule so i think this uh

1070
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,760
scenario perhaps may not be happened in

1071
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,359
the bpspf

1072
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,760
yeah i i remember this one from the uh

1073
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,440
from the email he sent what he's

1074
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,359
talking about is the fact that we uh

1075
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,400
we have handling of self uh

1076
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,000
self-originated nrli and by

1077
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,079
self-originated i don't mean

1078
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,599
i don't mean enter a lie from your

1079
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,119
neighbor i mean enter a lie where the

1080
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,359
node descriptor in the bgpls

1081
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,640
uh nrli identifies the uh

1082
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,520
receiving router and we do it and and i

1083
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,880
had added something to do it

1084
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,440
like the igps to speed the convergence

1085
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,880
in the case

1086
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,599
um i don't know if we don't think we let

1087
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,280
me talk about that with uh

1088
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,040
with the co-authors on the list we can

1089
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,359
see if we we don't need this

1090
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,599
uh but that was added yeah that was

1091
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,599
added to speed convergence

1092
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,800
in the uh in the

1093
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,319
event there was stale nrli but granted

1094
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,559
it should all go away as it permeates

1095
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:25,680
from the

1096
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,640
you know from the from the uh source

1097
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,280
from this

1098
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,800
from the originator just take might take

1099
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,839
a little bit longer without this

1100
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,160
okay

1101
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,240
we have a rule that you always if if if

1102
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,079
the uh this is to cover the case where

1103
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,640
the router restarts and loses all its

1104
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,440
stake

1105
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,480
we have a rule that if you receive

1106
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,040
nrli uh from

1107
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,720
the originator you will

1108
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,839
uh you will in fact

1109
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:18,319
prefer it even if it has a lower uh

1110
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,119
a less recent sequence number to take

1111
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,720
care of this case so probably maybe we

1112
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,000
don't need to

1113
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,119
discuss discuss the uh

1114
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,079
uh the self-originated case i thought

1115
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,839
about that as well

1116
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,079
okay any

1117
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:49,839
any more questions comments

1118
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,319
okay this is the last slide

1119
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,599
oh yeah yeah right right yeah the yang

1120
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,160
model

1121
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,480
work is in progress in uh

1122
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,440
care care and associates are working

1123
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,720
with it

1124
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,000
uh we're gonna work on it

1125
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,079
uh we're sort of i guess the bgp uh

1126
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,280
yang model has gone through

1127
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,240
one last call so it would augment it

1128
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:22,800
would

1129
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,680
augment the bgp la uh yang model in idr

1130
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,559
which is pretty big already with a new

1131
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,359
address family

1132
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,759
our new safi well

1133
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:39,920
k are you want to talk to that are we

1134
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,119
going to do all

1135
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,920
of bgpls or just what we need for bgp

1136
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,400
spf

1137
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,640
um we were thinking of doing it just

1138
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,839
specifically for

1139
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,200
bgp spf but it would be generic enough

1140
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,599
to

1141
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,280
extend it to ls eventually and maybe

1142
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,200
if we have an agreement if the chairs

1143
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,119
have an agreement with the chairs

1144
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,599
at idr that then it could be a common

1145
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,960
draft

1146
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,000
but what we don't want is

1147
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,800
to have a perception that we are taking

1148
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,720
over idr's work so if there is an

1149
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,280
agreement

1150
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,200
we'd love to do it at a common place i

1151
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,119
think it makes sense

1152
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,520
also but then again i'll defer that to

1153
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,280
chairs

1154
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,599
i think we should defer them to cheers

1155
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,520
of which you are one of them from idr

1156
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,800
nowadays so

1157
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:41,839
it's gonna be easy

1158
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,920
okay

1159
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,760
that's it uh victory of any last words

1160
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,760
to say at the end of the session

1161
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,240
specifically uh we'll talk um i guess

1162
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,520
we'll take that as a

1163
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,520
output sort of how we're going to deal

1164
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,599
with that along with idr

1165
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,400
um and then we will be processing some

1166
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,640
of these updates and getting

1167
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,319
and we'll let the working group know by

1168
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,319
mailing list when ready for the

1169
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,240
next working group last call now ac one

1170
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,839
question i had for you is

1171
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,240
um i guess we have to discuss whether we

1172
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,040
want to

1173
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,079
last call the b2b spec before the update

1174
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,480
to the applicability draft or if we want

1175
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,520
to get that rev

1176
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,000
and then kind of send them both in as a

1177
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,280
pair

1178
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,040
um if we if you don't think it's going

1179
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,160
to take too long to get the

1180
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,839
applicability updated

1181
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,520
then perhaps doing it at the same time

1182
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,440
maybe simplify things

1183
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,800
did you have a religion on that i don't

1184
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,119
no i don't uh i

1185
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,119
i wouldn't mind doing separate cycles

1186
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,119
but

1187
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,960
okay i'll discuss with gunter and

1188
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,720
headline and oh wait

1189
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,760
alvaro has something to say here

1190
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,559
uh hey i love that about you um so i

1191
00:51:58,559 --> 00:51:59,359
would prefer

1192
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,960
to we're going to publish them both

1193
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,720
publish them both together

1194
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,880
that doesn't mean you have to last call

1195
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,400
them at the same time

1196
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,720
um you'll progress through my q and i'll

1197
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,480
just push them both together

1198
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,960
at the end

1199
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,440
okay all right so i'll just because of

1200
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,040
gunpowder we were

1201
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,800
talking there about how to deal with the

1202
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,240
working group paul but

1203
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,400
it's understood and noted that uh when

1204
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,760
we're ready for publishing

1205
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,440
that we put them that they should go

1206
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,000
together for simplicity reasons

1207
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,839
no right so if you send them to me you

1208
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:30,960
can send them to me independently it

1209
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,000
doesn't matter i'll just

1210
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,599
at the end got it but you want to go to

1211
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,440
the isg once i

1212
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,839
understood

1213
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,559
me for now okay i think then uh

1214
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,040
i guess we'll finish that you know we

1215
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,760
give you back

1216
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,640

1217
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,640

1218
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:01,839
