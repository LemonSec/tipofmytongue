58
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,120
maybe not need to share your screen but

59
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,879
if you're talking you can put the video

60
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,519

61
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,319

if we need any hum we have a tool

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
here i don't know if you see my mouse

66
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,120
but that's um if we are asking a

67
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,560
question to the working group

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,360
um this is uh basically what we're going

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,840
to use

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,680
so the agenda i think

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
um is there any comment regarding the

72
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,320
agenda

73
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
um otherwise we should go through the

74
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,320
different drafts

75
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,199
and see we have basically

76
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,360
four presentations so it's ongoing draft

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,639
implementations updates and

78
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,919
new coming drafts

79
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
i currently we have two working group

80
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
two working group document that are in

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,280
working group last goal we have a two

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,000
document that

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
are working documents that are making

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
progress

85
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
um the working group lascal received

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,919
many comments um one question i would

87
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
have

88
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
is um i propose i mean how we're going

89
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,199
to use github

90
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,400
um i don't want to open the debate on

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,039
whether

92
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,720
how good is github and so on so

93
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,639
um i propose that

94
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,759
instead of just having

95
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,080
a huge pr as i did um

96
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,320
we should rather have a list of open

97
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,360
issues we

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,120
could put them into the github tracker

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
but the discussion should happen on the

100
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,479
mailing list so

101
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
which means that um every issues that

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,919
gonna be raised in the tracker

103
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,320
will be um open and discussed on the

104
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
mailing list so what i propose to is

105
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
that i'm gonna add um

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,000
issue regarding my comments and

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
i will let the co-author to open the

108
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,880
discussion on the mailing list

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
um is that fine for everyone

110
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:20,240
or anyone has a better way to proceed

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
the other question i had is regarding

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,639
interim meetings

113
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
so how do we um i'm wondering if

114
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,880
people would like to introduce more

115
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
interim meetings

116
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,199
or if that's a reason um if the interim

117
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,120
meetings are helping to make progress on

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,840
the draft

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,800
um that's something i would be happy

120
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,080
happy to know

121
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,120
um if those um interim meetings are

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,840
needed

123
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,318
we can um set some

124
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,720
from last atf i don't remember we had

125
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,160
any interim meetings

126
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
um and we should um

127
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,400
try i mean um we should try to see if

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,039
that

129
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,319
makes a difference and

130
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
last thing i had a discussion with the

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
rfc editors

132
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,680
and one other thing they

133
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
they told me that would help them is to

134
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,360
use

135
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
um xml the three so if we

136
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,360
have um i mean when you're submitting

137
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,400
your draft

138
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,440
um you could basically uh

139
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
try to submit

140
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,400
the v3 version instead of xmlv2

141
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,520
if you look at the coding i have put

142
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,880
some instructions on how to do that i

143
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,919
can share those on the mailing list

144
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,360
basically you could use the command line

145
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,120
um that is um provided by casten

146
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,160
or there are also online tools um

147
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
but just keep in mind that it may be

148
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,599
something um

149
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,759
to keep

150
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,360
any comment any question any

151
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
thanks before we move to the next um

152
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
presentation

153
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,840
hey daniel um yeah just just this is

154
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
regarding the recent comment you

155
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
posted on the github

156
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,000
so the the general comment is someone we

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
use github very

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
frequently and i do feel like

159
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,958
um putting comment inside of the

160
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,958
documents it's pretty hard to follow

161
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,000
okay rather we create a

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,839
uh pull issues right open an issue

163
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
for each of them that way we can track

164
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,399
all your comments

165
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,120
and put a comment under that that'll be

166
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
much easier instead of just click on the

167
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,560
pull request inside of the issues that

168
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,720
will be hard to follow

169
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
it doesn't make sense to you so okay

170
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,279
so the comments i'm gonna

171
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,920
um the comments i made i'm gonna put

172
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
them into the

173
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
the git tracker

174
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,800
uh comment you have already you just

175
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,680
delivered there

176
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
i will organized right for for now you

177
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,760
don't have to spend the time to do that

178
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,279
again because i okay i've gone through a

179
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,399
couple times

180
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,320
already uh initiated the discussion in

181
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,360
the middle east

182
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
so that's five but for the following up

183
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,440
uh comments i would rather you put a

184
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
pull request

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
uh then which basically means this is

186
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
one of the open issues then

187
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,160
either small one is fine right so we can

188
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,279
address each of them

189
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,640
then you know how many views we have

190
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,000
been drawn some things are missing okay

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,519
when you say pull requests because in

192
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,920
most cases i'm not trying to change the

193
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,800
text

194
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,000
so it's an issue i open an issue

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
yeah yeah if it's if you just edit the

196
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
text you can do a pull request so

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,279
another one is really just to

198
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
if you just open you should just open an

199
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,720
issue then we can just address from

200
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,320
there

201
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
okay nice feedback i will proceed

202
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,760
as um as you suggest um

203
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,680
okay and um so i yeah we have we have

204
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,120
one on the line please please yeah i

205
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
pretty much have moved us to version

206
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
three of xml

207
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,560
to rfc um i think we're we're good on

208
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,040
that

209
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,720
on current drafts just just just to let

210
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,920
you know about that

211
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,480
i made that transition pretty much once

212
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,320
uh hendrix said that version three was

213
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
ready to go

214
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
okay good

215
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,800
so just to make sure i'm understanding

216
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,000
schwei is gonna

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
handle the comments i provided um

218
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
in in into the tracker and you're gonna

219
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,120
open the issues

220
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,959
and bring the discussion to the mailing

221
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,279
list so i i don't need to do

222
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
anything on that side is that correct

223
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
uh daniel that's a firm team yes for now

224
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
uh for the current

225
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
account that you have i would definitely

226
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,200

or he's at students presenting

230
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,880
it's not stu it's students

231

232
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,399
the i would say with the

233
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,440
architecture but if

234
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,399
it's hy the uh that would be next on the

235
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,399
floor

236
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,800

268
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,480
uh so far we have received comments from

269
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
daniel in the github and stefan from

270
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,440
million list and eric

271
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
then we're gonna discuss some of the key

272
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,720
comments

273
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
we need to address in this meeting at

274
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
the end

275
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,319
and the last next slide please

276
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
next slide okay um so here is not the

277
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,880
entire list that we have done so far so

278
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,320
obvious summary center for youtube

279
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
revisions in the middle list so if you

280
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
are interested to get a chance in energy

281
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,040
each revision

282
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,480
you can definitely look through the mini

283
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,880
list but some of the major

284
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,760
objects needed to be emphasized here the

285
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,360
first one we

286
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,120
address all the editor notes which is

287
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,800
greater progress

288
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,959
and bob did a thousand review and

289
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,480
proposed text for the

290
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,160
fa final row which is great

291
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,680
and also one of the major things that we

292
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,320
have agreed to is to over reorganize the

293
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
previous text i believe that's that's

294
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,000
this revision five and we try to

295
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,760
consolidate all the

296
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,160
uh hit visual text to section four and

297
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,279
five

298
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,079
and also section six introduced the uh

299
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,199
crowdsourced

300
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,600
rate which is trying to bridge uh

301
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,320
broadcast study to network id

302
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
and then stools test we need to align

303
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
with the requirement with some

304
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,199
the terminologies like things like uh

305
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,639
replace us

306
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,000
us id with the drip entity identifier

307
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,320
which is i think is really reasonable

308
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,399
i mean the the principle here and the

309
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,639
reason for the changes because

310
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,199
we understand the us read stand for

311
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,720
remote identification

312
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,760
it's really not a identifier

313
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,839
and but in drip we actually working on

314
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,880
define

315
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,000
a ues identifier so i think the change

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,240
is

317
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,839
aligned with the requirement it's uh

318
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,639
it's a it's good as testing

319
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,199
another decision we recently made since

320
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,800
revision 10

321
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,240
uh is to remove the original section 7

322
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,600
uh drip transaction trustworthiness

323
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
uh since we all believe that actually

324
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
belonged to a

325
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,639
solution space in terms of where it goes

326
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,480
i think the co-author will decide

327
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,800
later and the last point i want to

328
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,680
mention

329
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
since the architecture draft we all

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,959
agree that is informational nature

331
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,079
and also for 80 recent comments we

332
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,760
replace all the normative

333
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,639
wording specifically in section four for

334
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,639
item six

335
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,560
um i think that's kind of like

336
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,839
quick fix not sure this is actually 100

337
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,079
percent right thing to do in the ietf

338
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,240
so do provide your comments on that

339
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
uh next slide please

340
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,560
so here's the things one of the topics

341
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
really

342
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
to get some decision in these meetings

343
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,079
right we want to get the working group

344
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,519
consensus

345
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,360
which is regarding uh you know what

346
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
level specification details

347
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,880
right drip architecture should include

348
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,959
right that means more specifically

349
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,639
we should ask the working group it is

350
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,160
the right thing to include enough

351
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,000
specification details

352
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,199
to justify the proposed solutions

353
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,519
the discussion is really around the new

354
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,120
sections we

355
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
organized like four five six but just to

356
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,519
recap right for

357
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,040
what other sections are right section

358
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,320
four is really just the usage of hhit

359
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,920
as a trustable uh drip identifier

360
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,839
and which is also including some of the

361
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
hid background definition and some level

362
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,440
of the details

363
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
regarding how hrt can satisfy triple

364
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,959
requirement

365
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
um the section five talking about the

366
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,240
drip registration to the issues then

367
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,519
section six

368
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,680
introduce the core source id which is

369
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,759
trying to bridge broadcast id to network

370
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:44,880
id

371
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,680
now the commonly received so far uh

372
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,639
regarding

373
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
that these issues are actually not very

374
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,560
consistent

375
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,199
so now i copy paste a few of them i

376
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,839
think three of the comments from daniel

377
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,240
eric and stefan in the

378
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,039
slide hopefully hopefully i'm not get it

379
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,640
out of context but

380
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
the key is trying to let us look through

381
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,400
the

382
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,839
comments see if this is really

383
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,439
acceptable to

384
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,160
including some level of the details to

385
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,119
like justify

386
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,240
why we propose hhit and some other

387
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,599
ritual matters

388
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
so the first comment from danielle

389
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,119
mentioned it's really reasonable to have

390
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
additional background information around

391
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,360
the rip ecosystem

392
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,799
but of course some texts need to be

393
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,080
simplified needed to be cleared

394
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
so that is actually aligned with our

395
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,360
current understanding

396
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,039
right so i don't want to read it through

397
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
whatever danny has said but i think

398
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,960
that's actually aligned with our current

399
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
understanding

400
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
uh next slide

401
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
but the uh recent review we get from

402
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
eric and stefan

403
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,320
kind of posed a different direction

404
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
um i recommend that it it's kind of

405
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,000
unusual

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,679
to uh have normative wording in

407
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,080
architecture draft right but that's all

408
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,760
that but that is not a prohibited which

409
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,120
is great news

410
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,679
but we need to deal with the normative

411
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,559
word

412
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,039
to reply to that since revision 10

413
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,360
we already removed or replaced the

414
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,320
number two wording

415
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,480
into sections as i mentioned earlier

416
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,919
not sure this is acceptable yet because

417
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,600
i don't receive any comments

418
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,120
so hopefully can get some comment

419
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,559
later then stefan also expected similar

420
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,640
concerns regarding the mixed solution

421
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
with the architecture discussion so

422
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,520
those are three main comments

423
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,760
um for me it's kind of root block how

424
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
should i address the comments because

425
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,679
the commonly received so far

426
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,880
really focus in these three sections

427
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,440
um next slide please so in order to

428
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,000
move us forward i think we need to make

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,120
a decision in this meeting

430
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,559
so how to fix this

431
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,840
issue right this is uh so but i want to

432
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,320
remind

433
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,760
us right before i think some time i run

434
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
10801 to

435
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
9 we have agreed that

436
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
drip architecture is actually a solution

437
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
based adaptation right

438
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,160
it's kind of informational but it's also

439
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,760
proposed as some sort of a

440
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,000
solutions right not only we should

441
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,640
include the entities around the drip

442
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,280
and explain how each components talk to

443
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
each other

444
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,520
as that's we have done in section one

445
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,600
now also we need to propose a solution

446
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,960
how to fulfill the requirements

447
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
specified in a requirement

448
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,600
draft a result without repeating

449
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,840
uh the text in the requirement so that

450
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,880
is the decision we have

451
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,080
made to keep architecture drafted

452
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
separately from the requirement and also

453
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
solution space

454
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,320
so that being said in my opinion i think

455
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,679
including all the co-authors from

456
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,039
offline discussion

457
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,520
we believe all those sections should

458
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
stay

459
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
but of course some of the details as

460
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,919
daniel mentioned already uh we needed to

461
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:14,240
be

462
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,360
justified that can be done but before we

463
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,559
even move forward to fixing stuff

464
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,440
and we need a working group of consensus

465
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,640
uh if we

466
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,000
should keep these sections right um

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
now we are in the working group last

468
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,200
call i think

469
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
we needed to ask specifically that if we

470
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
want to

471
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
and keep section 415

472
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,840
then i guess things are much easier we

473
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,280
just follow up with the

474
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,200
comments and fix the problem about point

475
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,799
by point

476
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,679
but on the contrary we don't want this

477
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,679
in the architecture draft

478
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,520
and just to be honest i have i don't

479
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
know how to

480
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,520
how to move forward without even talking

481
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,120
about hijacking because i think that's a

482
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,000
decision we made a long time ago

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
uh in the end in my home opinion i think

484
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,080
it's

485
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
those sections actually provide a really

486
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,600
great

487
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,240
introduction information for this

488
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,159
solutions base right things like

489
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,440
uh us id or authentication draft

490
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,919
right with all the without this uh

491
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,080
background information uh

492
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,120
the the solution seems like a weight

493
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,919
it's a little weak to me so here's the

494
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,679
main issues here's the thing is i want

495
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,000
we want i want us to to think about that

496
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
and

497
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,039
to to at least we should know clearly

498
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
what we should do for the final

499
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
publication

500
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
uh also there's just a minor comment

501
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,280
regarding too many economies and

502
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,080
and i think that's that's a fair comment

503
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,200
and we definitely need to fix that

504
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,080
um i think that's that's the that's all

505
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,520
i wanted to discuss

506
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,520
this last this is the last slide that's

507
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
all well this is all i wanted to discuss

508
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
and so floyd is open and

509
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
i want us to i want to hear i want to

510
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320
hear the other comments regarding

511
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,600
how to how we deal this

512
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,719
right anyone in the queue

513
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,760
is yours yeah okay i have to be careful

514
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,520
i had to be careful about speaking out

515
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,840
of school here in some of the other

516
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,080
meetings i've been in um our

517
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
architecture draft

518
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,799
project presents ietf

519
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,480
as an sdo as a player in

520
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
this whole arena and what we are

521
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,000
bringing to

522
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,600
the um uas um

523
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,880
commun arena so having the

524
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,840
the architecture structure as it is is

525
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,640
very

526
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,000
powerful for outside our community

527
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,919
and that is a document that i've been

528
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,240
first pointing people to

529
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
see what we are doing what we are

530
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,240
bringing things which are probably going

531
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,159
to be coming up in the next

532
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,200
number of months in discussions

533
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,679
this kind of becomes a key document and

534
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,520
then i point them to the

535
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,559
other document i just had just yesterday

536
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,880
another individual representing yet

537
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,240
another community

538
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,640
pointing them to uh work that we're

539
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,840
doing here

540
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,200
so um we need to look at this that

541
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,320
we are with this document we are not

542
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,799
just

543
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,919
here in the ietf we are the ietf as an

544
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,880
sdo

545
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
participating in a much larger community

546
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,039
and and that's why i feel that the

547
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,559
structure we have achieved

548
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,679
is important and that's all i want to

549
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,840
say with regard to

550
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,240
keeping four five and six as they are

551
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,840
because all three of them

552
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,120
i've been pointing people too

553
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,840
enough for my soapbox

554
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,840
dude that has lost audio

555
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,799
no uh who is next i mean med meda are

556
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
you here

557
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,440
yeah okay can you handle the queue

558
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,159
because i i i don't see the queue

559
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
see what is next please please okay

560
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,279
okay i only have um one quick comment

561
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
um the only new

562
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,279
architectural entities that drip has

563
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,360
introduced into the uas

564
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,640
rid pre-existing architecture

565
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,000
are the finders and the

566
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
crowdsourced rid supplemental data

567
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,679
service provider

568
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,600
so i feel that if the architecture

569
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
document is supposed to talk about

570
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,080
all of the entities in our architecture

571
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,039
section 6 needs to remain in the

572
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,080
architecture document

573
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,919
thank you stewart eric

574
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,600
so first my major concern was about this

575
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
using this mass uppercase and basically

576
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,360
using normative language into an

577
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,559
informational

578
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,799
document you have put everything in

579
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,840
lowercase

580
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,480
uh you may want to remove as well then i

581
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
think in section two you still keep

582
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,600
oh we are using what's called bcp14 so

583
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,320
remove it

584
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,520
now my major concern is is solved

585
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,600
okay we could go over but i think it's

586
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
all the nice way

587
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,320
um about the section four five and six i

588
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,279
think uh

589
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,559
they describe the hit a hit

590
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,840
and the release three

591
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
i'm a little bit concerned if we put

592
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,039
some content here

593
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,679
and we got other draft the two document

594
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,799
must be con

595
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,520
consistent if specifically if the akita

596
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,320
draft

597
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,559
is going forward quickly and it seems

598
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,799
pretty close a good last call

599
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,120
and then we change our mind and we

600
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,559
change

601
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,880
the other document and we change what it

602
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,320
is

603
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,640
right that's a major concern

604
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,400
now if we are confident that it's not a

605
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,159
concern

606
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,799
we can go forward but my major concern

607
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,799
and again it's simply my concern

608
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,559
and my concern simply to ease the itf

609
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,480
last call and the isd

610
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,559
evaluation yeah right just provide you

611
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,679
guidance

612
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,640
nothing was blocking there

613
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,120
thank you eric this is really i would

614
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
say an important comment to uh to hear

615
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,320
from the i would say

616
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,840
the editors and yeah and we need to

617
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,240
work out how to better articulate with

618
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,880
it tanks

619
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,480
in the architectural document so that it

620
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,799
can be i would say a base reference for

621
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,840
the work we are doing

622
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,360
and i would say the the main entry point

623
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
for the uh the contribution from from

624
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,000
the

625
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,320
working group yeah so so should i please

626
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,679
please take note of that and we will

627
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,880
discuss how to uh

628
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,400
to handle that um daniel please

629
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,240
yeah so i i think we are all heading in

630
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,679
the same direction so i

631
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,120
i think the sections um four five uh

632
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,320
six are important and um

633
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,760
as mentioned eric um i mean

634
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,600
we should not have something the

635
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,200
architecture document should not

636
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,320
be completely abstracted from

637
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
the solution space but it should not tie

638
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,399
too much to it

639
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,799
so we need to find the middle ground so

640
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,159
that when someone

641
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,440
reads the document he understands what

642
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,799
an h-i-t-e-h-i-i-t

643
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,919
is why we use that what is the main

644
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:56,559
principle

645
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,720
the main motivation for that how it's

646
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
going to articulate with

647
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,760
the registries and so on and

648
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
i mean the the discussion should be

649
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
sufficiently high level

650
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,640
so that if we have some changes

651
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,679
in uh six months uh one year

652
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,919
um it's not going to affect the full

653
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,120
architecture so

654
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,159
which i mean the way we described uh

655
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,840
should give a good insight a good

656
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,600
understanding of the reader

657
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,120
how the documents are going to be

658
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,799
articulated

659
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,679
and not the document the concepts and

660
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,880
then

661
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,679
i mean the the solution space documents

662
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,880
are here to

663
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,559
to say oh yeah in the architecture

664
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,679
dimension yeah we have a smaller

665
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,159
radio frame so we need that

666
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,080
authentication framework so that we can

667
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,919
carry the rads

668
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,320
um oh yeah we we need to be able to bind

669
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,120
that ri

670
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,399
er er our id to um

671
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,039
to some information in registries and so

672
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,919
on and

673
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,480
and then if we use dns and we use or

674
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,240
something else

675
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
um it's not a big i mean it should not

676
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,480
be

677
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,520
a big a big problem um later

678
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,240
so i i think it's it's all about finding

679
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,120
right

680
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,000
um middle the right balance between

681
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,720
those two

682
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,039
things

683
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,960
on this one danielle no problem right we

684
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,559
can

685
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,799
as long it's not normative and basically

686
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,320
put all the balls and we cannot move

687
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,840
anymore if we

688
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,399
keep the door open to some major change

689
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:32,960
but

690
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
minor change uh refinement everything is

691
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,559
fine

692
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,399
i'm quite happy to quickly browse to the

693
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,159
document you just released

694
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,960
and i'm way more epic than before and

695
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,600
again

696
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,720
i'm not the final word here

697
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,320
thank you eric thank you thank you

698
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,720
daniel um so the next one is adam and

699
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,360
then we will

700
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,600
close the um the line just uh right

701
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,840
after

702
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
yeah so i'm i'm going to agree with

703
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,080
daniel on this

704
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,600
and eric as well um on everything that

705
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,120
was just stated

706
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,320
i think the best frame of mind to walk

707
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,039
into this

708
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,640
is when you look and read the

709
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,279
architecture document it is

710
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,440
general enough that in six months we

711
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,840
don't have to completely rewrite it

712
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,640
we're using uas remote id as the first

713
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,600
use case

714
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
there might be a use case in a year from

715
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,120
now which is like oh we're going to do

716
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,279
microcontrollers and iotx

717
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,559
devices we don't want to have it so

718
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,279
bounded to that so like for example

719
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,720
broadcast remote id

720
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,880
that crowdsource remote id thing is very

721
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
much a uas remote id

722
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,000
concept i think so

723
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,440
i i'm torn on section 6 being either an

724
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
architecture in the uas right draft i'm

725
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
not quite sure where it should go

726
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,880
because it is very much a uas remote id

727
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,080
thing because that's where it applies

728
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,559
but as a general concept it's good so i

729
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,360
think if we find that balance

730
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
that daniel and eric were pointing out i

731
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,720
think that would be

732
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,919
the best way forward

733
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,240
thank you adam bob

734
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,519
if we can maybe do a little softing of

735
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,039
the words and say

736
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,880
this is technology which uh

737
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,600
is the way that you want to look at

738
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,679
solving this architecture

739
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,320
and then three years from now there may

740
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,000
be other technology

741
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,519
which will be invented which also will

742
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,880
solve this fit into this architecture

743
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
maybe that's a way to address some of

744
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,320
these things that's saying that

745
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,440
well what about something else

746
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,519
make the architecture use hhit

747
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,200
and use the registry as here are ways

748
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
that no look at this technology

749
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,320
technology as

750
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,600
this is how it can be done and then the

751
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,279
later documents say and this is how we

752
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,559
are doing it

753
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,760
um but then make it so it's it's

754
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,960
also an example of what

755
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,600
any technology needs to do to meet the

756
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,440
requirements

757
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,120
or meet the design the the framework

758
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,360
now that that helps or not and i'll look

759
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,200
at that and review that without

760
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,960
yeah for example section four is um

761
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,320
h8 it for the rip

762
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,760
um entity identifiers um i think the

763
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,840
section should be i mean the title just

764
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,600
the title should be more

765
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,440
um uh the ident the direct identifiers

766
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,120
and then we explain why h

767
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,159
i t is a valid choice

768
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,200
and how it's going to be is going to be

769
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,039
articulated with uh

770
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,960
i don't think it'll take much of it i

771
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,559
don't think it take much of a change to

772
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,679
do that

773
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,159
um we're pretty close to that in terms

774
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,039
of wording

775
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
changing the title adding maybe another

776
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
sentence and something another

777
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,159
another sentence um we can show that

778
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,440
and then dive into and this is what this

779
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,200
brings to the architecture so somebody

780
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,039
comes with some other great idea

781
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,799
say well you got to be able to

782
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,559
do as well as this if not better

783
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,080
again i have to be careful not speaking

784
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,840
out of school for some of the other

785
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,080
groups i'm in and some of the other fun

786
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,440
discussions i've been

787
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
uh party to

788
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,120
thank you thank you for have close

789
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,360
meetings

790
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
thank you bob should i please if you can

791
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,720
conclude in yeah

792
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,159
in one minute you can move to the next

793
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,640
class yeah

794
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,080
all right i mean it's that's great so

795
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,399
this is a great comment i'm i'm so glad

796
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,279
we talked about that

797
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,760
and this is really make things clear i

798
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,080
just want to echo

799
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,040
stool first um the the crossover is

800
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,918
actually not new

801
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,760
it has been there we just you know try

802
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,320
to pick it and put in the 66

803
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,320
and uh i think this weird piece of

804
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,918
information we needed to put in the

805
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,440
architecture thank you this is only one

806
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,520
piece information bridged broadcast id

807
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
to network id and this is for

808
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,079
future looking right even though fa said

809
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,599
okay we only need to broadcast it right

810
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,719
now

811
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,960
right and but network id should be the

812
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,560
future so that's one of the piece

813
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,440
information we should

814
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,280
keep it um um then regarding the section

815
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,760
two

816
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,679
uh definitely we should remove the

817
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,879
nominal working and

818
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,280
wording and i think i i thought i did

819
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,359
some good work but looks like i

820
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,159
missed something um and now face section

821
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:50,960
four and a five

822
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,879
being consistent with the the solution

823
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:54,480
speech that's something we really need

824
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,679
to be careful um

825
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,920
i think daniel put a greedy comment in

826
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,760
the in in the github

827
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,839
which is really regarding um what kind

828
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,119
of level the

829
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,280
details we should put in there i think

830
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,880
we needed to the co-authors

831
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,119
needed to actually work closely to

832
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,920
identify

833
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,880
things we are for sure won't be changed

834
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,680
at least in

835
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,040
half a year a couple years but if astm

836
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,560
decided okay we want to change the buy

837
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,599
numbers right yes

838
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,720
change from 200 to 300 then

839
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,560
that's something we are actually out of

840
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,000
control

841
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,680
um section four and then i think the

842
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,079
last we have just said we should change

843
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,040
the title right

844
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,599
and then you missed that already um we

845
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,480
should be

846
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,560
i think we should be good to go uh

847
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,920
as i think last email we see from daniel

848
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,760
i think we should be address your

849
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,920
comments so

850
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
in a couple weeks that should be uh

851
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,359
doable

852
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,079
all right hopefully i'm not gonna miss

853
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,599
anything just

854
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,440
let me know thank you

855
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,720
right so i think we can move on to the

856
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,839
next presentation

857
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,359
thank you schwein so just to sum up

858
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,920
we we're i mean we're quite close to the

859
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
end of the tunnel so

860
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,880
no big mess um in that document

861
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,280
um but that's um the discussion worth um

862
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
with it so let's move to the next

863
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,800
presentation

864
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,200
unless we have any other comments

865
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
hello can you hear me well

866
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,240
is it android yes should i start yeah

867
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,160
sure

868
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,200
um i think yeah now we see the slides

869
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,760
again

870
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
so my name is andre gordov and i'm going

871
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,280
to present

872
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,720
an update on drip implementation status

873
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,359
from students work at clean shopping

874
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,640
university

875
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,440
so first uh a few slides are going to be

876
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,240
the same as

877
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,040
last time except that they have a bit

878
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,359
more

879
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,440
time to to go from from them in the

880
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,400
detail

881
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
and then i'm going to jump to the actual

882
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,560
implementation status

883
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,160
so the starting point for our code was

884
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,440
open hip version two uh which is

885
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,760
available on bitbucket

886
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,880
and the the draft was a new crypto06

887
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,599
from bob

888
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,480
but i think current one is zero and nine

889
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,040
but i think actual code now supports

890
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,000
zero seven zero eight something in in in

891
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
between

892
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,599
and uh for students working on that

893
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,400
code because it's prerequisite for for

894
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,839
drone id

895
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,960
and then the actual code for for for

896
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,839
drone id was with open drone id uh

897
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,200
project

898
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,119
um and this was part of an advanced

899
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,440
project on secure systems in in shopping

900
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,359
university which was

901
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:09,599
run last fall and we are going to have

902
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,640
it again

903
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,200
next year so in next fall we can hope to

904
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,839
get to another level in the

905
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,560
implementation next slide please

906
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,599
so what is needed to implement drip is

907
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,240
some new

908
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,599
cryptographic features from heap so new

909
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,119
crypt algorithm

910
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,480
based on edward's digital signature

911
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,359
algorithm

912
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,480
and also new orcid so if you know the

913
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,480
part of ipv6 address space

914
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,160
is reserved for things like

915
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
host identity protocol and also mobile

916
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,599
ip

917
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,560
uh so it's needed uh to implement an

918
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,839
extension to orchid

919
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,040
to have so-called hierarchical hits uh

920
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,920
so in the beginning the heat was just

921
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,839
sort of 128 bit

922
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,040
hash when there was some prefix added to

923
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,760
it

924
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,400
and later there is a need to have a few

925
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,720
other intentions to have some hierarchy

926
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,920
so like who actually issued this hit

927
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,440
host identity tag

928
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,079
which is a hash of a host public key

929
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,959
next slide please

930
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,960
so orcid is essentially a combination of

931
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,359
a few things

932
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,720
like in traditional orchid it was

933
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,079
a prefix then orchid generation

934
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,960
algorithm id so it's a type of hash

935
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,320
function which is used to

936
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,079
generate it like sha2 or

937
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,200
256 or shafri and so on

938
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,320
and then the prefix which is a part of

939
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,800
ipv6 address space which is reserved by

940
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,480
ayana

941
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,920
and the final hash which is 96

942
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,520
bit long which is a hash of a public key

943
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,000
of

944
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,040
a host identity

945
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,680
but the new orchid modified it so that

946
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
there is this new field called

947
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,800
info which is part of a

948
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,640
hash so which gives the name of

949
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
authority which

950
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,200
generated this particular hash so for

951
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,079
example

952
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,920
each company can have its own version of

953
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,040
registry for these hits and not like a

954
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,920
completely

955
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,200
global global space

956
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,319
of course it makes itself shorter which

957
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,680
increases probability of

958
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,319
collisions so it's not maybe anymore

959
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,440
guaranteed that

960
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,040
two hosts can have uh statistically

961
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,599
unique

962
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,800
uh hits so they need maybe increased

963
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,079
need for

964
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,880
heat collision detection and resolution

965
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,520
next please

966
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,839
and why do we need this

967
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
i'm not hearing andre

968
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
i think he went proof okay because he's

969
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,680
gone

970
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,440
i'm back right okay yeah now you're back

971
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,040
okay maybe connection cut so

972
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,720
ed ddsa is more efficient than even

973
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,280
normal elliptic curve not speaking about

974
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,839
like

975
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,680
traditional errors and dsa which just

976
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,319
have huge key sizes

977
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,720
uh so for some lightweight things such

978
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,960
as iot and drones we need the algorithm

979
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,839
which is fast but also has very small

980
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,280
signature size and also

981
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,800
that's the reason why we need something

982
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,040
better than advanced encryption standard

983
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,280
for symmetric crypto

984
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,640
because this chaor cipher is a more

985
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,760
lightweight alternative and uh in the

986
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,640
current code we also starting to move to

987
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,880
so-called hoodiac cipher which is a

988
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,720
candidate for lightweight crypto

989
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
competition in nist

990
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,800
but it's not kind of clear if it's gonna

991
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,160
win or not so we are

992
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,760
following the situation and we're

993
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,680
updating the code to

994
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,960
uh to hudiak support at the moment

995
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,119
and final thing is this key derivation

996
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,800
function uh because uh

997
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,960
it's this key key ddf is more efficient

998
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,359
than the other previous functions so

999
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,200
again for

1000
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
lightweight devices such as drones

1001
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,480
running on battery it's

1002
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,839
important factor next

1003
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,079
so the current status like the project

1004
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,000
basically ended by the new year and the

1005
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,200
this latest curves are supported now as

1006
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,040
well as

1007
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,800
edds a host identity generation

1008
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,680
based on these curves also the new

1009
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,400
arcades

1010
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,000
based on hierarchical hits i implemented

1011
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,800
and the key derivation function based on

1012
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,839
kayak

1013
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,000
so kkdf and kiak is implemented as

1014
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,480
a cipher lightweight site for

1015
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,240
alternative

1016
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,680
as well as codyak is in the process

1017
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,000
and it was tested in the core simulator

1018
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,480
that this basic change with heap version

1019
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,079
2 works fine

1020
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,520
and succeeds so the code is kind of

1021
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,880
ready for use

1022
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,560
um next slide please

1023
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,880
uh so as we know drip is based on using

1024
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,240
hip version 2 heat so

1025
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,880
basically broadcasting it over bluetooth

1026
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,440
or

1027
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,960
uh four and five or wifi

1028
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,640
uh like uh maybe in traditional mode

1029
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,839
or in so-called nein board

1030
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,160
neighborhood awareness node so the

1031
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,560
testbed and implementation was using a

1032
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,440
raspberry pi

1033
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,720
as a tool to implement it so

1034
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,359
you can like attach it to the drone as a

1035
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,960
kind of legacy

1036
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,240
way to support drones or maybe future

1037
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,280
drones can

1038
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,480
implement it directly but the latest

1039
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,040
drone id seminar in in europe i attended

1040
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,400
there is actually already several

1041
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:34,960
companies

1042
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,880
implementing those add-on boxes to

1043
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,760
comply with eu laws so it seems to be

1044
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,440
also an option just to buy this small

1045
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,920
box and stick it to your old drone and

1046
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,319
you become kind of compatible and legal

1047
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,640
and the challenge is the size so in

1048
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,200
bluetooth forward is like only 20 bytes

1049
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,280
so it's kind of hard to to fit things

1050
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,119
into it

1051
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,240
and also there was a receiver android

1052
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,400
in android application developed so that

1053
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,359
the observer

1054
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,079
and the policemen can see which drones

1055
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,760
are flying nearby so it

1056
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,560
receives this broadcast information and

1057
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,040
and

1058
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,839
displays it on the screen as well as a

1059
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,760
back end so some kind of web server

1060
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,400
which

1061
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,760
keeps track of registry like

1062
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,760
which drones which hits the corresponds

1063
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,040
to each drone owner and so on

1064
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,599
next slide

1065
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,599
so the current uh proposals like in eu

1066
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,960
and sdsm we have no

1067
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,760
no trust in broadcast messages so if

1068
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,520
drip is supported when we

1069
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,760
basically broadcast this uh hierarchical

1070
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,119
hit

1071
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,520
which is generated based on our orchid

1072
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,880
from

1073
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,160
a public key of a drone and

1074
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,079
the implementation that i'm going to

1075
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,359
talk about is

1076
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,359
based on this draft version from uh

1077
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,480
i think end of october so we have the

1078
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,280
architecture

1079
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,640
and the protocol draft so now i guess we

1080
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:04,960
are

1081
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,599
a bit forward but the basic things

1082
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,280
should still work

1083
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,960
so next slide

1084
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,200
so the current status is that the

1085
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,640
application is

1086
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,079
implemented on android phone and tested

1087
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,000
and it can use like google maps to

1088
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,800
display the drone coordinates on a map

1089
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,240
and

1090
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,880
this information is fetched from a

1091
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,319
back-end server which is

1092
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,040
a kind of alpha implementation of heap

1093
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,760
registry

1094
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,599
which drip registry which

1095
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,640
things has things like operator

1096
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,160
id position and so on and on

1097
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,200
raspberry pi so rpa is raspberry pi

1098
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,200
there is a script that basically

1099
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,920
implements drip in a very simple way so

1100
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,640
what it does

1101
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,839
it downloads uh

1102
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,000
latest open hip version installs

1103
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,440
generates uh

1104
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,800
public key heat and then uses another

1105
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,720
script to broadcast it over bluetooth

1106
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,920
so kind of very uh simple

1107
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,200
way to implement drip next slide

1108
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,319
so the drone is the raspberry pi

1109
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,520
yes in this case you can kind of stick

1110
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,359
stick your raspberry pi to a drum

1111
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,119
so basically there are two scripts

1112
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,280
one that configures raspberry pi to have

1113
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,480
a correct version of

1114
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,839
openssl because

1115
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:44,079
well actually it was a huge job to

1116
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,640
upgrade open heap to support

1117
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,319
open ssl reasonably

1118
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,240
late version because there were a lot of

1119
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,240
changes but still it's not like the

1120
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,880
latest

1121
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,319
version uh so we need to use configure

1122
00:47:58,319 --> 00:47:59,359
that

1123
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,359
and the other script actually takes a

1124
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:02,559
hit from the

1125
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,599
file system and then broadcast it using

1126
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
bluetooth frames

1127
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:13,599
next slide so this is a format of

1128
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,240
bluetooth 4 standard so as you you can

1129
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,800
see the payload is

1130
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,079
not big something like uh 20 bytes and

1131
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,440
well uh heat is uh four bytes so it's

1132
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:25,760
not

1133
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,440
uh like that big but if you need

1134
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,160
additional things uh like signature and

1135
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,440
so on which are

1136
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,240
part of the drip uh it's like maybe not

1137
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,359
enough

1138
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,160
but for bluetooth 5 there is going to be

1139
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,079
increased

1140
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,040
sizes so and hopefully it's going to

1141
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,440
work

1142
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,400
but even for raspberry pi it says it

1143
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,599
implements bluetooth five

1144
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,400
it's actually only implements limited

1145
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:52,880
features

1146
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,559
part of it but now we acquired also

1147
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,680
usb uh sticks that have full bluetooth

1148
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,520
five support so hopefully

1149
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,240
in autumn we can experiment more with

1150
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,920
that part

1151
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,480
next slide

1152
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,599
and since bluetooth standards were

1153
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,839
reasonably

1154
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,680
compatible it's kind of easy to move

1155
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,280
between versions

1156
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,440
and easy to use with just few lines of

1157
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,480
code

1158
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,800
and there is a good support for android

1159
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,839
for scanning

1160
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,680
scanning bluetooth bacon so it was

1161
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,160
relatively easy to implement this

1162
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,200
application and some preliminary tests

1163
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,800
that indicate that bluetooth 4 is

1164
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,440
roughly 100 meters and 0.25 maybe half a

1165
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,800
kilometer so

1166
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,160
much larger range and also the payload

1167
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,000
is much bigger in bluetooth 5 so it's

1168
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,720
going to be

1169
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,559
more compatible and better

1170
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,839
implementation

1171
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,760
next slide and this is actually the

1172
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,920
funny script which implements drip in in

1173
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,839
raspberry pi so basically you first

1174
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,880
install write libraries when you install

1175
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,119
write open ssl version when you install

1176
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,240
openhip and

1177
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,319
in the end you call a navascript which

1178
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,040
just takes hit from a

1179
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,599
file system and sends it via bluetooth

1180
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,319
so it's

1181
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,040
kind of simple and hacky way to

1182
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,079
implement

1183
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,800
basic drip next slide

1184
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,800
and the backend kind of alpha version of

1185
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,200
heap

1186
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,319
registry it was based on this web

1187
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,119
technologies

1188
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,480
which uh has some database which maps

1189
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,920
hit to things like uh

1190
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,960
position of operator owner name model

1191
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,160
of aircraft and so on so it's kind of a

1192
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,240
back-end which is used for database

1193
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,720
next slide

1194
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,040
so in this picture you can see the basic

1195
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,880
idea that this drone is flying and

1196
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,599
broadcasting

1197
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,119
hit and then this android application

1198
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,280
actually makes a lookup in the backend

1199
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,480
in the server

1200
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,720
to get some current information about

1201
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,599
drone let's say owner and maybe some

1202
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,000
geographical position and so on and then

1203
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,680
the application can use this

1204
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,960
information to create a picture of a

1205
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,559
drone's flying in the area

1206
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,040
next slide

1207
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,559
so this application was based on on java

1208
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,920
and cradle

1209
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,720
and using google maps api to actually

1210
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,359
place the markers and download the

1211
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,839
geographical map picture office

1212
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:38,079
area next slide

1213
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,119
so this screenshots from application so

1214
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:41,599
it

1215
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,800
for example here it shows like six

1216
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,240
drones in this area with certain

1217
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:51,440
ids which are being broadcast

1218
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,839
and you see them also mapped on the

1219
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,720
geographical map of lean shopping being

1220
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,839
placed somewhere

1221
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:04,480
on the map

1222
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,520
next slide so this

1223
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,319
android application was based on

1224
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,440
open drone id and basically performs a

1225
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,720
parser of bluetooth messages and then

1226
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,440
using google maps api displays it on on

1227
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,839
the map

1228
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,240
so it's a bit limited because it's based

1229
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,920
on bluetooth four but

1230
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,359
as i said we plan to go to five also

1231
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,319
uh we didn't have uh like a device which

1232
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,359
is uh

1233
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,680
supporting wi-fi neighborhood awareness

1234
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,480
node

1235
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,599
uh mode i think uh raspberry pi's don't

1236
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,680
don't do that so but i think latest

1237
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,800
devices from like galaxy

1238
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,359
maybe s10 already does it so maybe in

1239
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,400
the

1240
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,240
autumn we try to get this kind of phone

1241
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,680
and then experiment with

1242
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,400
nin mode because it's much better way

1243
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,240
you don't need to root your mobile phone

1244
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,119
to

1245
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,319
actually implement it so it's much

1246
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,480
easier for like a normal user just to

1247
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,240
download the application from a store

1248
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,040
and then started

1249
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,079
using it instead of turning

1250
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,599
turning phone into a hacking mode

1251
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,960
next um

1252
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,599
yeah so bluetooth five is on our to-do

1253
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,520
list and uh

1254
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,119
nin mode and then adding certificates uh

1255
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,079
to a broadcast so that the hit is

1256
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,839
authenticated

1257
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,520
and maybe provide some better

1258
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,760
visualization in the

1259
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,200
application for example maybe

1260
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,160
have a marker reflect somehow size of a

1261
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,200
drone and speed

1262
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,280
or some how dangerous is it or something

1263
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,720
like that so that

1264
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,319
for example users can have a better

1265
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,480
view of what's happening in the area and

1266
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,160
what kind of drones are flying there

1267
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,280
next so to conclude

1268
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,280
there was some simple version of drip

1269
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,960
implemented

1270
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,040
based on heap version 2 extensions

1271
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,000
and yeah some problems were faced with

1272
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,520
limited support

1273
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:14,400
of bluetooth 5 and wi-fi mode in

1274
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,440
inside the raspberry pi but

1275
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,960
in future we hope to to use the latest

1276
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,359
sticks and usb sticks and maybe

1277
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,640
latest smartphones to have better and

1278
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,599
more more full implementation but the

1279
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:32,630
good thing is that

1280
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,839
[Music]

1281
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,839
open heap is more or less complete and

1282
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,319
ready

1283
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,839
to be utilized for this so seems to be a

1284
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:42,240
good

1285
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,839
way way forward so if there are any any

1286
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:46,319
questions

1287
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,520
i can answer yeah and

1288
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,960
just to add that i went for the trouble

1289
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,599
to become

1290
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,720
official drone pilot in eu so i had to

1291
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,960
read like 200 pages of documentation and

1292
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,839
pass two hours

1293
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,880
online exam so it was actually

1294
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,280
pretty complex i mean like more

1295
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,160
difficult than

1296
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,160
getting in driving license it seems so

1297
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,760
not not too many people are flying

1298
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,880
drones nowadays

1299
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,680
in europe i guess

1300
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,240
but thank you andre for the presentation

1301
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,839
any comments any questions

1302
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,680
i'm hearing uh stuart

1303
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,920
i'm wondering when we might consider

1304
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:34,720
doing

1305
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,240
um a plug fest to

1306
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,880
check interoperability of the

1307
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,720
independently developed

1308
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,880
implementations that you have there at

1309
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,640
the university and that we have

1310
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,920
at the new york uas test site i'm not in

1311
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,280
a big rush to do that i think we've got

1312
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,799
some work to do before we can but i

1313
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,000
think it would be a great thing to do at

1314
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,400
some point

1315
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:01,200
yes maybe in itf which is going to be

1316
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,960
in the autumn we can have some kind of

1317
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,240
hackathon or

1318
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,960
interrupt session the students are

1319
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,520
active again

1320
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,839
i i think that would be highly

1321
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:14,839
appreciated

1322
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:18,480
and really helped

1323
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,640
i mean the draft i mean um

1324
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,839
i mean it would provide some

1325
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,440
additional confidentiality that uh the

1326
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,040
specifications are

1327
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,359
working um and i think that's gonna ease

1328
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,440
the process um

1329
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,119
i don't know how much is required but

1330
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:45,839
i'm letting eric to jump on that

1331
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,319
so eric

1332
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:58,559
are you here yeah i was there i was six

1333
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,319
simply taking time to find back the

1334
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:01,839
right button on the right window

1335
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:06,640
yeah sometimes it takes

1336
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,640
so now um i understand you asked me a

1337
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,920
question like can you rephrase it

1338
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,640
danielle

1339
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,520
okay so um we were talking about

1340
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,440
interoperability because we

1341
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,720
currently we know there are two ongoing

1342
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,079
implementations

1343
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,559
of the specifications and um

1344
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,319
the question that um i was uh asking is

1345
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,920
how much having an interoperability

1346
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,480
before moving the specification forward

1347
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,359
is um

1348
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,640
helpful or not

1349
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,960
it's always helpful right so in some

1350
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,799
working groups within routing area there

1351
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,480
we try absolutely

1352
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,839
to have two interpretable implementation

1353
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,160
before going to working group class call

1354
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,920
now uh we are not that far uh but

1355
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,760
proving that we have two

1356
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,599
interval implementation of usually

1357
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,880
makes things way easier after right

1358
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,839
so you don't need to document it you can

1359
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:08,559
do a draft you can get a wiki page

1360
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:12,079
or whatever you want but having a trail

1361
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,400
somewhere that people can go and see in

1362
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,440
public

1363
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,680
that's happening that's perfect it helps

1364
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,960
a lot on the screen some looking group

1365
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,720
so that's highly encouraged absolutely

1366
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,319
okay so let's move to the

1367
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:37,119
i think does it answer so i are in the

1368
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:37,440
queue

1369
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,240
also okay i i don't see the queue

1370
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,119
exactly

1371
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:43,599
i would just point i'm in the queue i

1372
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,280
would just point out that

1373
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,880
interrupt for grip

1374
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,160
is fraught with needing to have the

1375
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:52,960
devices

1376
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,079
within radio range this

1377
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,200
makes it with our virtual

1378
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,000
work challenging i mean potentially uh

1379
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,119
andre could ship code to

1380
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,720
adam and adam could put some stuff

1381
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,160
together and

1382
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,880
and see maybe that he can actually uh

1383
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,119
run

1384
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,280
andre's code there at the new york test

1385
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,400
site

1386
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,520
but until we get to san francisco or

1387
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,599
potentially we could have

1388
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,079
a physical hackathon it's

1389
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,960
this is not like other itf efforts which

1390
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,680
can be done across the net

1391
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,480
we have to innovate yeah that that was

1392
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,480
the assumption bob

1393
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,000
thank you uh should i please

1394
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,319
yeah i think uh netapp is great um but

1395
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:46,960
uh

1396
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,640
we're really not there yet right i mean

1397
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,280
i think the first step is really to

1398
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,440
find the people find the time um come up

1399
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,480
with a open

1400
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,720
platform that everybody can experience

1401
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,079
what triple looks like

1402
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,520
right i mean everybody can get a drone

1403
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,319
now it's not that hard to to to to

1404
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,680
experience right there's

1405
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,079
so many open source code bases like open

1406
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,280
jewel id and

1407
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,160
some cheap bluetooth module module

1408
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,960
people can buy

1409
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,880
i mean if we can come up with some

1410
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,160
really basic uh

1411
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,960
code base for people to start with that

1412
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,839
would be fantastic

1413
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,960
to help drip move forward

1414
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,520
all right thank you

1415
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,880
thank you so let's move to

1416
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,920
the next presentation

1417
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,200
okay can you hear me now we're good

1418
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,920
yeah okay let's just go right into the

1419
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,400
first

1420
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,720
uh content side if you go down daniel

1421
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,400
and we have the final rules from the faa

1422
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,520
being published

1423
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,440
it's our first final rules out in the

1424
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,119
world so that's what we're kind of

1425
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:00,880
targeting with

1426
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,520
eu is not too far behind but we have

1427
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,520
these final rules which are there for us

1428
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,480
to be

1429
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,760
working against these are supposed to be

1430
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:10,440
uh

1431
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,200
performance-based rules um they expect

1432
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,319
sdos to now

1433
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:16,240
actually say how it's done and then

1434
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,079
produce an mlc

1435
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,640
that's not what itf to do but are kind

1436
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,200
of like inserting into the process

1437
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,040
an important thing which is part of

1438
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,480
these final rules

1439
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,640
is that they remove the network remote

1440
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,640
id and i won't go into the whys and

1441
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,000
where force

1442
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
and where and how that may change in the

1443
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,079
future but they added something they

1444
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:38,240
called the remote id module

1445
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:43,280
for upgrading non-compliant existing uas

1446
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,119
and this is going to be important and

1447
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,359
particularly what andre has built

1448
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,240
is a remote id module it's not what's

1449
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,839
controlling the plane and this is an

1450
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,680
important distinction

1451
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,720
in the faa and also is coming out

1452
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,319
in um in europe potentially as well

1453
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,400
um point is we now have a target

1454
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,319
deadline supposedly

1455
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,359
when um vendors are going to be wanting

1456
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:08,400
to put create

1457
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,119
code and put product out we just

1458
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,000
received

1459
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,480
a two and a half month extension of the

1460
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,200
deadline

1461
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,760
that came out just a couple days ago

1462
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,799
from the faa

1463
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,680
where they uh because of uh reviews

1464
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,039
because of the new administration

1465
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,520
everything being extended so uh there's

1466
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,480
been a two and a half

1467
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,680
month push out of deadlines

1468
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,559
but nonetheless we now have final rules

1469
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,640
we now have deadlines we now have things

1470
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,920
to target

1471
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,480
too and and like i said the big thing

1472
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,520
now is

1473
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,760
these remote id modules are firmly

1474
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,119
defined

1475
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,319
in the final rules you can see them if

1476
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,599
you just go to the summary you don't

1477
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,039
have to go through the whole rules

1478
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,160
just look at the executive summary and

1479
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,240
you'll see what the what's about these

1480
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,039
modules

1481
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,000
being able to snap them onto a ua to be

1482
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,559
able to participate in mode id

1483
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,839
next slide please

1484
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,480
and because of these uh modules the faa

1485
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,720
says that these modules cannot use

1486
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,039
session ids whereas

1487
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,039
inside the ua you can have session ids

1488
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,000
they can only use the serial number of

1489
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:20,640
the

1490
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,599
remote module not the serial number the

1491
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:24,160
ua

1492
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,160
but these remote modules have their own

1493
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,400
serial number which is encoded in the

1494
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,319
cta

1495
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:32,720
2063a format only

1496
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,240
that's the way the rules written right

1497
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,920
now and doesn't leave much

1498
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,720
wiggle room um from discussions that

1499
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,559
i've been participating in

1500
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,119
don't expect faa to change the rules

1501
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,559
regarding that so

1502
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,960
what did i do i came with the way that

1503
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
hierarchical hits can be encoded

1504
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,079
in the cta 2063 format

1505
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,880
so that these modules could benefit from

1506
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,079
hierarchical hits

1507
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,880
um and and be able to use them and to be

1508
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,520
able to

1509
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,680
use the auth though this would not be a

1510
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,799
session id

1511
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,079
that can be in theory change uh for each

1512
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,200
uh operation but it's rather set in it

1513
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,559
but the potentially the manufacturer

1514
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,760
could use this

1515
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,880
uh for for creating their

1516
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,119
serial numbers and then benefit from the

1517
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,000
rest of it

1518
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,480
so that is an important addition and why

1519
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,520
i added it

1520
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,640
i added to meet the faa definition

1521
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,559
of the rid modules

1522
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:35,839
so take a look at that and

1523
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,000
understand why i did that

1524
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,480
the other thing that i did per our

1525
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:43,440
chairs

1526
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,480
is i took the off that the auth

1527
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,119
draft and i merged it in creating some

1528
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,160
new definitions

1529
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,039
and creating appendix f so i pretty much

1530
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,000
lifted what adam

1531
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,839
had in off zero six did some massaging

1532
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:58,559
of it

1533
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,160
and there's appendix f so uh

1534
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,160
you should see that i've now completed

1535
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,520
i've done things there

1536
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,559
and i've done that merge in those are

1537
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:08,960
the

1538
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,680
if you do a diff between version four

1539
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,520
and version

1540
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,240
nine i think our current version is nine

1541
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,760
or six seven or whatever

1542
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,839
um you'll see that those are the only

1543
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,520
substantial changes

1544
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,799
in the document move on to the next

1545
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,440
slide please

1546
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,440
because we have the final rules astm

1547
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:38,039
group 38.02 which is the owner of the

1548
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,200
3411 document that we're working against

1549
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,680
has restarted they're looking at what

1550
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,880
changes were made

1551
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,680
and now coming out with the which would

1552
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,079
be a version 1.1

1553
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,640
they need to do this quickly because of

1554
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,640
again these these deadline time frames

1555
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,359
for

1556
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:57,039
manufacturers to put it into their

1557
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,720
equipment

1558
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,839
we can expect to have an id type

1559
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:02,640
allocated

1560
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,520
for hierarchical hits that's pretty much

1561
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,200
a no-brainer and agreed upon

1562
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,720
our requesting changes the

1563
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,039
authentication menu those changes are

1564
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,799
in the queue thing to note is that the

1565
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:17,599
faa removed

1566
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,400
all cyber security from the final rules

1567
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,000
the preliminary rules had a lot of cyber

1568
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,720
security

1569
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,720
there's nothing about cyber security in

1570
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,400
the final rules

1571
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,640
so people are asked why is this message

1572
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,680
now needed

1573
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,599
i won't go into why it's kind of like

1574
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:33,920
future proofing

1575
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,760
areas we can expect a resolution on all

1576
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:38,400
this from

1577
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,760
astm f3802 by the end of march

1578
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,880
and having to know know what our in a

1579
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:48,319
sense marching orders

1580
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,839
what can we work with but we can we can

1581
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:54,480
work with yes there will be an id type

1582
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,160
allocated particle hits

1583
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,319
and there will be

1584
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:02,960
some um changes made authentication

1585
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,599
method

1586
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,799
message such that what we are doing will

1587
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:07,200
fit

1588
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,960
into the uh our proposal will be

1589
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,960
accepted in some form

1590
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,400
um moving on um

1591
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,680
i can't speak at school yeah okay

1592
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,400
i was just wondering um i didn't get why

1593
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:24,799
cyber security has been removed

1594
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:27,680
uh you'd have to go through all the

1595
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,880
comments

1596
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,920
that um and the responses that in the

1597
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,640
the final rules the faa has a whole set

1598
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:35,599
of discussions

1599
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,400
here are the comments that you received

1600
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,440
and here's a various

1601
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,240
companies positions on this some foreign

1602
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:42,559
some

1603
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,680
against and here's the action we took

1604
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:47,200
so if you want to understand why they

1605
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,440
removed it it was basically

1606
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,760
either vendors saying that this is too

1607
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,559
hard

1608
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,039
too much of a demand on our processor oh

1609
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:55,599
this is

1610
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,319
only within radial range why are you

1611
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,480
concerned about this because you have

1612
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,039
security because the range is only a

1613
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:04,640
half per kilometer per

1614
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:08,160
uh the uh the bluetooth five uh so

1615
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,400
it's kind of cute stuff and and there's

1616
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,520
like i said

1617
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,440
if you want to understand why look at

1618
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,520
the final rules and look at at

1619
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,920
the fa was pretty good at including that

1620
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,719
debate

1621
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,120
and i don't want it to spend any time it

1622
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:21,759
is what it

1623
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,920
is uh uh we're we're kind of like kind

1624
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,960
of coming out saying that

1625
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,520
um all this discu i'll make i will say

1626
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,158
something

1627
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:32,960
what we're doing here is saying that yes

1628
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:34,479
we had all this discussion

1629
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,399
because people didn't know how to do it

1630
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,319
here we are an sdo saying

1631
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,359
and here is how it can be done with

1632
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,198
inside the capacity

1633
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,319
of these devices okay

1634
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,759
great so we're sticking our foot

1635
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,839
in the uh in the fire here in a sense

1636
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,960
um as an aside and i posted this to the

1637
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,920
110 mailing list that you may have seen

1638
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,839
is that anyone here involved in e

1639
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,520
911 location accuracy because the faa

1640
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,198
wants a 15 foot altitude at 95 percent

1641
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,359
for the ground control stations and

1642
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,479
discussion has been

1643
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:15,759
that this may not be possible with

1644
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,520
current affordable

1645
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,120
tech i won't go for you with

1646
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,600
other debate items but this particular

1647
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,560
one i

1648
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,719
i've been asked to go out on a fishing

1649
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:27,679
expedition

1650
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,920
to find out if there's people elsewhere

1651
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,120
who are familiar with

1652
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,319
with e911 and how um

1653
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:37,520
the the toggle community

1654
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,080
is meeting the elevation altitude

1655
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:40,880
requirement

1656
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:44,479
of e911 because faa wants to do the same

1657
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:48,158
for remote id so that for instance the

1658
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:49,600
first responder can know that the

1659
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,839
operator is on the third floor balcony

1660
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,359
not that operator on the fourth floor

1661
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:55,440
balcony

1662
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,640
so it looks like that if you look at

1663
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,679
the gcs documents themselves at

1664
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:03,040
jesus.gov

1665
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,760
they're saying plus or minus 13 meters

1666
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,320
so it's uh i'm reaching out for people

1667
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:10,960
who are who

1668
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,880
have any experience in this and i have

1669
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,960
gotten a couple of you respond

1670
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,440
so this just just aside so but what

1671
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,880
still needs to be done

1672
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,440
and the big thing is i need to merge

1673
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,199
what i did in appendix e

1674
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,840
into what's in appendix f and i'm pretty

1675
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,800
much done that

1676
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,920
but i need to resolve this replay issue

1677
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,840
and i'm interested in inputting into

1678
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,400
this uh ideal appendix e and replay one

1679
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,040
way

1680
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,040
appendix f really does not address

1681
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,400
replay

1682
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,560
what is i have the time stamp i have in

1683
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,679
appendix e

1684
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:46,400
is the time that it was created and

1685
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,120
expecting the uh

1686
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,360
the observer to not trust to be on a

1687
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,560
certain period of time

1688
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,679
appendix f has a use by date

1689
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:59,199
but it allows that to be too large

1690
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,280
uh i will be posting to the list my

1691
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,239
thoughts on this

1692
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:04,239
i think what it's going to be is that in

1693
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:05,280
the product

1694
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,239
using an attestation in a broadcast mode

1695
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:10,320
i use an authentication message

1696
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,480
that that that the um time stamp

1697
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,000
is a future out no more than one

1698
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,040
minute that this particular

1699
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,719
attestation could only be trusted for um

1700
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:27,440
for a very short period of time and

1701
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,040
that's why i need to say to protect

1702
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,960
against the replay attack

1703
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,199
uh now we've posted to the list and this

1704
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:34,960
is this important discussion

1705
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,159
because um if we are supplying trust

1706
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,719
here and we want to protect against um

1707
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:41,840
fraudulent use

1708
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,480
we need to be able to constrain this i

1709
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,040
see russ is in the queue and and stewart

1710
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,120
so let's let's press this the q before i

1711
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:55,679
go forward

1712
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,000
and cheers can you open up the queue

1713
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,199
yeah see what please

1714
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:08,560
oh sewer dropped off russ hi um so

1715
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,520
uh the cell phone industry association

1716
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,159
did a

1717
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:16,000
911 accuracy

1718
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,360
uh test for location and if you want to

1719
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,199
get in touch with those people i can

1720
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,440
introduce you

1721
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,960
thank you please do because

1722
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,520
um it'd be interesting to see how they

1723
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,640
achieved it

1724
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,159
um the the accuracy that is required

1725
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,960
which is three meters and the faa is

1726
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,239
kind of willing to settle for four

1727
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:39,120
meters

1728
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,679
uh do they do after three meters well

1729
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,280
the concern here was

1730
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,560
uh if you're dealing with a

1731
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,480
uh metropolis uh

1732
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,520
you know the first responders go to the

1733
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,560
wrong floor

1734
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,000
you've cost a lot of time exactly

1735
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,400
it is a different use case i understand

1736
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,400
the use case

1737
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,600
and our use case is the uh

1738
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,280
they're trying to find the operator for

1739
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,080
whatever reason

1740
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,600
is my audio working this time yeah

1741
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,920
okay so um just a quick answer on the

1742
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,840
why did cyber security get entirely

1743
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,719
dropped

1744
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,000
um because they dropped for the moment

1745
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,120
and they were clear that this was only

1746
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,080
for the moment

1747
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,320
network remote id and retained only

1748
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,840
broadcast remote id

1749
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,000
and further because broadcast remote id

1750
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,440
does not even require

1751
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,239
a two-way bluetooth or wi-fi link it can

1752
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:37,199
be simply

1753
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,080
a broadcast from a transmitter on the

1754
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:40,800
aircraft

1755
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,480
that doesn't even have receive

1756
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,159
capability they

1757
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,360
assumed that that totally eliminated all

1758
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,800
cyber vulnerabilities

1759
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,040
in the system which i find horribly

1760
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,719
naive but that was the reasoning

1761
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,320
okay thank you and they basically just

1762
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,800
punted on the issue of fraud

1763
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,280
on the the content

1764
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:12,159
so uh the last the next point is

1765
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:16,080
is i need to fix the dns examples um

1766
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,080
stuart and adam have given me some some

1767
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,159
content of what i need to put in there

1768
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,640
um so i need to work on that uh one of

1769
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,280
the

1770
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,159
things here is that we are looking at

1771
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:27,520
some of the stuff putting it under

1772
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,560
some um aerial

1773
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,760
tld but i have talked to two different

1774
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,920
companies that say these hardcore hits

1775
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:36,880
are so

1776
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,440
interesting we can use them what we want

1777
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,400
to do

1778
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,280
and they're not um aviation related at

1779
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,000
all

1780
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,600
so that's why i kind of would like to

1781
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,760
see if we can find a home

1782
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,679
for the dns structure for hydro hits

1783
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,480
which is not in aeronautics and allows

1784
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:54,960
that

1785
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,239
some of the space to be used in

1786
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,679
aeronautics but some of the space

1787
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:58,480
potentially

1788
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,640
otherwise each group is going to want

1789
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,560
going to anna for their own prefix

1790
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,840
which is not good so that's one of the

1791
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,600
things which i need to dance around and

1792
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,040
again i'll be asking for

1793
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:11,920
help on the list coming up on that but i

1794
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,080
think that's it

1795
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,440
when you mean they are not from the

1796
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,760
aeronautic industry they're not also

1797
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,199
from the dns industry they are from

1798
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,120
another kind of industry well there's

1799
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,719
some iot industry

1800
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:26,640
yeah but that's perfectly happy to be

1801
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,480
able to have dns be able to look up for

1802
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,400
fine stuff

1803
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,800
and they and and they want to be able to

1804
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,239
have uh

1805
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:36,880
harco hits work for them as well and

1806
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:38,159
that they have their

1807
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,120
raa that they will have for the their

1808
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,199
for for their community

1809
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,320
so it's like uh um that's what i hope

1810
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,360
would have happened

1811
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,719
and and and that i'm in conversation

1812
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:53,360
with with one company about about what

1813
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:53,760
they're

1814
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,560
they're doing so that's i need to uh

1815
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,000
allow for that i'll be posting some of

1816
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,040
this to the list

1817
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,440
coming up but those are the only two

1818
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,239
areas left

1819
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,480
right now based on any changes that

1820
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,000
discussion that on architecture

1821
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
will get to me that those are two things

1822
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
i need to fix

1823
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,640
based on comments i've received and then

1824
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,080
we're open for last call

1825
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,440
and i need to get that out hopefully

1826
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,679
before passover comes at the end of this

1827
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:19,360
month

1828
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,199
that's my goal get something out before

1829
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:23,759
passover

but i'll be starting it off so these are

1841
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,199
some draft updates on the drafts that

1842
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:04,239
are not on working

1843
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:06,880
group last call um so the authentication

1844
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,840
format was

1845
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,199
adopted on the 18th of

1846
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:15,120
december last year the document is up on

1847
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,120
github i moved it up there so that it

1848
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:17,440
was

1849
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,679
publicly available it's in markdown so

1850
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,520
you guys can go and look at it

1851
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,840
uh post comments uh pr requests

1852
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,640
issues however you feel comfortable once

1853
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,679
we get a rhythm

1854
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,679
with architecture i think it'll just

1855
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,840
naturally flow into this document

1856
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,360
uh the document is currently on a hold

1857
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,360
uh this is just due to as bob was

1858
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,280
mentioning in his last presentation

1859
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,760
there are some f-3411 updates that are

1860
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,800
coming up

1861
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,600
uh in the authentication message uh two

1862
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,320
of them are

1863
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,520
the fec uh some of our fec work might

1864
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,560
be integrated into astm itself

1865
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,640
which negates the need for it to be in

1866
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,400
our draft so

1867
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,560
i need to see where that ends up landing

1868
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,520
and also

1869
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,640
to harmonize a bit better there's some

1870
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:05,840
discussion on an auth

1871
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,280
type and a pseudo drip header

1872
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,159
of some capacity in the message itself

1873
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:12,560
but

1874
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,840
those are more astm specific

1875
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,120
but in general we are in queue and once

1876
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,960
the changes are confirmed we will

1877
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,159
update the draft accordingly um so

1878
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,600
the also uploaded actually earlier

1879
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,719
last month was the registries draft

1880
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,440
so this is just a stump of previous work

1881
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,360
when we broke apart some other drafts

1882
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:35,840
the

1883
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,560
identity claims draft was ripped apart

1884
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,040
and

1885
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,360
some bits went to bob's draft some bits

1886
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,040
went to architecture

1887
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,280
some bits came from architecture and got

1888
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,760
thrown into this draft some bits from

1889
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,120
auth formats

1890
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,520
so this is a bit of like where all the

1891
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,560
registry stuff has

1892
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,320
landed because we had written text

1893
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:57,280
previously in lots of other documents

1894
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,640
so this is where it now sitting

1895
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,040
the main thing that this draft does hold

1896
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,800
is the provisioning process a somewhat

1897
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:06,000
detailed one

1898
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,640
for interactions between the parties to

1899
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,040
get ids registered into dns

1900
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,400
at least on a high level um so we just

1901
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,080
need some word spitting i think on that

1902
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,840
side and figure out where it fits in the

1903
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,960
draft

1904
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:23,280
um i do have some missing sections

1905
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,320
um how the id is added and updated

1906
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,440
to link to a serial number via probably

1907
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,960
epp

1908
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:33,760
how the id is looked up to get a serial

1909
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,760
number but only by authorized parties

1910
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,600
using rdap

1911
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,760
and exactly what fields need to be in

1912
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,800
the registry

1913
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,040
um and me and michael palace have been

1914
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,400
working in the background

1915
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,400
the past three weeks going back and

1916
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,320
forth trying to figure

1917
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,800
this out and get a little bit more

1918
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,040
concrete detail on

1919
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,040
and i think with that if we go to the

1920
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,760
next slide

1921
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,560
i believe the next slide is going to be

1922
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,360
michael's

1923
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,320
portion so michael you may take the

1924
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,320
stage

1925
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,880
well can everybody hear me we can hear

1926
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,159
you yeah

1927
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,880
excellent um so what i'd like to do is

1928
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:13,199
uh

1929
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:17,120
give an update on what we've been up to

1930
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,159
uh since ietf 108 when i first

1931
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,199
presented the concept of what the

1932
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:26,159
regis potential registry uh would look

1933
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:26,800
like

1934
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,920
um and what uh what i've done is uh in

1935
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,719
the context of another gtld.music that

1936
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:34,159
we'll be launching

1937
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:36,400
we have actually come up with a full

1938
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,080
registry sandbox

1939
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,080
that deals with authenticated users

1940
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:45,199
and also uses rdap to provide

1941
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:46,880
differentiated access

1942
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:50,080
to uh data uh about the

1943
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,639
contact droids stored in the registry so

1944
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:53,360
these are

1945
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,320
important concepts um that we think are

1946
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,000
important in the broader

1947
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,560
uh drips discussion because there

1948
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,360
clearly

1949
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,840
um needs to be some account of data

1950
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:04,560
privacy

1951
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,880
considerations particularly in europe

1952
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,320
with the gdpr

1953
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,320
as well as balancing those with the

1954
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,080
needs of first responders and law

1955
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,280
enforcement

1956
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,679
right now we have come up with

1957
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,480
operational

1958
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,280
code in the dot music top-level domain

1959
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,400
we will be

1960
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,840
uh going public with this within icann

1961
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,400
and one later this month and then what

1962
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:27,520
adam and i

1963
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,920
bob and still be doing is looking at how

1964
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,360
to take that code

1965
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,639
and begin to modify that to handle

1966
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:38,000
a potential uh mock-up of

1967
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,360
what a drone registry would look like

1968
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,480
as adam had uh just uh mentioned before

1969
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,400
we are beginning to look at what those

1970
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,480
different con profiles of

1971
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,520
uh those contact droids or

1972
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,920
grips what they what the individual data

1973
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,719
elements

1974
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,880
uh would need to contain and the

1975
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,639
potential access

1976
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:01,120
those data elements uh by different

1977
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,719
requesters within the

1978
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,840
um ecosystem uh one other thing

1979
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,719
that i will be touching upon in this

1980
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:10,239
presentation today

1981
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:13,040
is uh some recent lego and regulatory

1982
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:13,840
update

1983
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,880
uh from europe uh particularly uh in the

1984
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,760
area of

1985
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,280
cyber security so uh while the faa

1986
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,480
has temporarily hunt it uh

1987
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,040
on cyber security interestingly enough

1988
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,400
the european

1989
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:32,000
union as part of their nis ii

1990
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,600
uh initiative uh actually uh has become

1991
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,520
specific uh enumerated areas which

1992
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,159
potentially intersect with the work of

1993
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:43,199
of this group

1994
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:46,159
next slide please

1995
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,760
so my apologies for the non-ascii

1996
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,719
diagram here but in the interest of time

1997
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,800
it was it was a lot easier

1998
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,400
um this was this was uh the original

1999
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,840
concept that i shared uh with the group

2000
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,760
uh during ietf 108 and the concept that

2001
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:08,560
the main

2002
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,280
concept that we were trying to convey

2003
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,040
with this diagram here

2004
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:17,040
was the idea of a registry providing

2005
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:20,480
different authoritative sources uh in a

2006
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,840
distributed manner

2007
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,719
um recognizing that there were we were

2008
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,480
not trying to create a

2009
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,280
single mother of all databases to hold

2010
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:29,920
everything

2011
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,320
we realized that in order to meet a

2012
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,400
certain national requirements

2013
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,800
there would need to be a distribution of

2014
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,400
certain data sources

2015
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,719
and how that data would be done in an

2016
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:42,000
authoritative way

2017
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,280
but then allow the contact droids move

2018
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,480
seamlessly

2019
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,239
uh between the the different

2020
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,120
participants uh within the ecosystem

2021
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,920
um so again just what we're looking at

2022
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,080
is potential manufacturers

2023
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,120
um being able to write globally so that

2024
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,560
all participants

2025
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,320
um would be able to have that but then

2026
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,239
recognizing that some

2027
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:06,639
uh data elements would be stored

2028
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:07,760
nationally

2029
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,120
um recognizing certain data localization

2030
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:11,679
laws

2031
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,639
uh within some countries um next slide

2032
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,360
um just do we expect overlap between the

2033
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:19,840
data

2034
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,600
or is it data posted at one

2035
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,600
so there will be some so one of the

2036
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,199
things that will obviously be very

2037
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:28,719
important here and you'll see that i

2038
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,719
think with the the manufacturers

2039
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,520
is there needs to be global uniqueness

2040
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,320
um

2041
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:37,040
there needs to be global uniqueness with

2042
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:37,520
uh

2043
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,360
if you will the product the drones that

2044
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,880
are entering into

2045
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:44,400
the broader ecosystem um and then the

2046
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,520
ability to

2047
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,920
provide uniqueness for individual

2048
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,360
identifiers of the

2049
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,800
operators uh that can actually be done

2050
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,199
by using a second level domain what we

2051
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,520
were proposing here was using

2052
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,639
sort of mimicking the iso 3166

2053
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,040
ii character using that as a second

2054
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:03,840
level

2055
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,800
and then allowing a local registry in

2056
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,600
country

2057
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,800
to store that particular operator

2058
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,840
pilot information um but then because

2059
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,040
the drones

2060
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,920
uh would be written globally that local

2061
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,600
registry would be able to have the

2062
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,320
ability to take that contact droid

2063
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,400
um and have access to it so that is uh

2064
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,480
what we are trying to convey and if i

2065
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,159
could go to the next slide real quick

2066
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:30,800
i'll

2067
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,480
i've actually come up with what i think

2068
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,840
is a good example

2069
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,800
uh to explain how this differentiation

2070
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:38,320
could potentially work

2071
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,639
um so for those people that may be

2072
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,360
familiar

2073
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:44,639
the dot co is the uh colombian uh

2074
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,639
country code top level domain

2075
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,760
um although this is a cctld

2076
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,880
dot co has been marketed as a hybrid

2077
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,920
um it is recognized in country

2078
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,280
as serving the colombian local internet

2079
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,159
community

2080
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:03,360
but then is also broadly marketed as an

2081
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,320
alternate uh gtld to the broader

2082
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,600
internet community

2083
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,120
and what's interesting here when you

2084
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,520
look at the particular ecosystem

2085
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,320
of what they've done is there are one

2086
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,840
set of registrars

2087
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,719
and resellers that sell second level

2088
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:19,920
domains

2089
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,199
at the at the second level in dot co

2090
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,320
but then there are if you will uh uh

2091
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,400
third level registrations occurring in

2092
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,280
dot org

2093
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,639
and dot com uh in the dot co space

2094
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,760
those uh those registrations are again

2095
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:36,159
done

2096
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:38,400
through a series of competitive

2097
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,679
registrars

2098
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:41,520
uh and resellers so this is where you

2099
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,080
would see the uss and other people

2100
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:47,600
providing a dynamic marketplace to

2101
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,960
provide these services um the other

2102
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,120
example i use here to show a perhaps

2103
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,320
more restrictive

2104
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,080
access within this hierarchical

2105
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,239
namespace is mill

2106
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:01,520
dot co uh this is there are there are

2107
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,400
third level

2108
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:05,199
domains registered in mill dot co um

2109
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:05,920
that are not

2110
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,800
available to uh commercial registrar to

2111
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,159
provide those services

2112
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,639
those are in fact um issued by the

2113
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:13,760
government itself

2114
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,400
so this was kind of an example of a

2115
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,159
parallel when some people were

2116
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:21,679
trying to wrap their arms around uh

2117
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:23,679
the the ability of having different

2118
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,440
authoritative data

2119
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,360
um uh if you will federated but

2120
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,600
interoperable

2121
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,480
uh within an ecosystem we thought that

2122
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:32,800
this

2123
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:37,199
is uh again one example uh a a potential

2124
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:38,400
analog

2125
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,080
um moving forward to the next slide

2126
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,199
um and this was also something that was

2127
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,440
uh this was a table that was presented

2128
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,239
in um

2129
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:51,280
iatf 108. um this in

2130
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,840
trying to if you will explain to

2131
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,239
regulators and other people that may not

2132
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:56,560
be

2133
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,080
as intimately involved in the the drone

2134
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,800
space um we have talked about this

2135
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:03,840
concept of

2136
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,560
vin numbers um i believe one question

2137
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:07,120
about

2138
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,560
globally unique so much like vin numbers

2139
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,159
um are you know when a when a car

2140
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,280
rolls off of a manufacturing uh

2141
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,239
assembly line uh somewhere in the world

2142
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:22,400
there is a vin number associated

2143
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,120
with that vehicle and that vin number is

2144
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,080
globally

2145
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,400
um accessible so that would be something

2146
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,600
that every

2147
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,560
uh participant in the ecosystem they

2148
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,159
would require uniqueness

2149
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,840
as well as access um to that identifier

2150
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,679
then when you get into the individual

2151
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:42,000
license plates which would be affixed

2152
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,639
to the drones or the individual drone

2153
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:45,679
operator

2154
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,480
um of credentialing or licensing that

2155
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:49,920
would be the equivalent of the driver's

2156
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,639
license

2157
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:53,120
so these are some of the authoritative

2158
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,480
data sources

2159
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:57,280
that a registry will need to track to

2160
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:00,159
allow the utms and the uss

2161
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:03,520
um to begin to exchange uh data

2162
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,960
um in an interoperable uh and in a

2163
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,880
unique manner

2164
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,159
next slide please

2165
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,320
so what i um as again

2166
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,679
um adam had touched on this before

2167
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,800
we have begun to go through some of

2168
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,840
the uh different data elements

2169
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:29,520
um and what are what are those

2170
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:32,400
profiles of of the different voids

2171
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,400
within the ecosystem so

2172
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,480
what are those repository object

2173
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,000
identifiers that are going

2174
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,199
to be uh exchanged within the epp

2175
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:44,639
registry and what are the underlying

2176
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,080
data elements

2177
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,400
that are going to be necessary not only

2178
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,320
are we looking at what data is going to

2179
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,679
need to be collected

2180
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,800
but we are also identifying what data

2181
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,639
potentially would have

2182
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:00,320
a pii associated with it because that

2183
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,679
then may trigger a differentiated access

2184
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:04,159
to that

2185
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:06,719
underlying data based upon the

2186
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,960
credentials of the registrar

2187
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,080
so this is some of the as adam had uh

2188
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,920
alluded to what we've been doing over

2189
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,760
the past three weeks

2190
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,880
is trying to sketch out what the

2191
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:22,719
minimum voids would be

2192
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,679
for an initial registry deployment and

2193
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:26,000
then

2194
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,040
expanding that as we begin to

2195
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,040
get a fuller view of who all the

2196
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,679
participants are in the ecosystem

2197
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:37,199
next slide please okay so i'm actually

2198
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,719
going to take over for here

2199
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,639
um so this is a diagram i'm i'm using

2200
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:44,480
ascii art so

2201
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,280
sorry michael i'm stepping above you a

2202
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,320
little bit

2203
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:51,280
uh in classiness um so this is a

2204
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,400
registry key

2205
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:55,120
value and lookup link diagram so there

2206
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,880
are five

2207
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,679
main registry key values that we need to

2208
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:00,000
keep

2209
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,199
track of in a drip

2210
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:06,320
ecosystem the serial number

2211
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:09,440
the ua session id the uss account id the

2212
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,520
ua registration number and the operator

2213
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,960
registration number

2214
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,960
and you can only look up certain

2215
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,080
information if you're

2216
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,199
authorized so for example authorized

2217
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:20,000
personnel

2218
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,920
only could look up from a ua session id

2219
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,719
to a serial number which a serial number

2220
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,960
in this case and in any

2221
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,920
subsequent slide is an ansi cta 2063-a

2222
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,760
and it's either the serial number of the

2223
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,360
aircraft itself

2224
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,679
or of the ua's remote id module

2225
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:41,520
something that bob touched on

2226
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,000
in his presentation that these modules

2227
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,199
were introduced and

2228
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,480
are required to use these serial numbers

2229
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,600
they cannot use a

2230
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:53,280
session id and only

2231
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,800
a caa can look up from a serial number

2232
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,880
to a registration number a ua's

2233
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,639
registration number that's in

2234
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,520
their database of registered aircraft in

2235
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,880
their

2236
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,520
flight area and from that get an

2237
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:09,040
operator registration number which is

2238
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,840
considered

2239
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,440
pii uh we're not quite sure on the link

2240
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,320
between ua session id and the uss uh

2241
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:17,679
account id

2242
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:19,920
um that's kind of a gray area it might

2243
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,760
depend on the uss

2244
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,880
but we imagine it is something more akin

2245
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:25,520
to like an

2246
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,960
authorized personnel an admin of the uss

2247
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,080
or a law enforcement agent who wants

2248
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,800
wants it can look it up uh next slide

2249
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,120
please

2250
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:39,440
and do you expect any books would be a

2251
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,159
dns or

2252
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,400
um so could you repeat the question

2253
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,440
daniel sorry do you do you expect

2254
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:53,040
any square box to be a dns server

2255
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,159
or i mean the database being a dns or

2256
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,120
yes partially um let's go to the next

2257
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,440
slide and i'll try to

2258
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:04,719
go a little bit deeper into that so

2259
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,719
in this diagram it's the same diagram as

2260
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,639
before but you'll notice that i have it

2261
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:10,000
blocked out into three

2262
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,120
main areas caa maintained registries

2263
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,040
manufacturer maintained registries and

2264
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,440
uss maintained registries

2265
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,719
note that it's not that the uss has to

2266
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:21,440
go to a

2267
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:23,360
manufacturer maintain registry to get

2268
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,440
the serial number

2269
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,560
um it's more the authoritative location

2270
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,000
where the serial number would

2271
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,679
originate from and its main

2272
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,960
unit in some scenarios

2273
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,360
it might be a dns entry in other

2274
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,440
scenarios it might be an actual

2275
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:43,920
database like an honest-to-god database

2276
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:45,280
not a dns

2277
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,840
lookup it depends on the use case

2278
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,480
scenario uh

2279
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,440
next slide please

2280
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,639
so this is an example of the of possible

2281
01:33:58,639 --> 01:33:59,440
registries

2282
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,440
and their interlinks so you'll notice

2283
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,679
that in all three of these

2284
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,120
the serial number is in

2285
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,960
each one but certain pii is in the caa

2286
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,400
maintained registry

2287
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,320
um and only the set and the session id

2288
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,800
can be looked up to the serial number

2289
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,400
through an rdap lookup

2290
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,480
the dns lookups to like get the

2291
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:23,440
certificates

2292
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,400
and the public keys for the hierarchical

2293
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:26,719
hit

2294
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,120
would be a dns entry but all the other

2295
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,120
information would not probably be

2296
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:33,040
dns entries because they could be

2297
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,320
considered

2298
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,199
um public information the one where it's

2299
01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:39,280
a bit of a gray area is the manufacturer

2300
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,760
registry so you'll notice it says serial

2301
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,719
number make

2302
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,639
model et cetera et cetera so you could

2303
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,280
make model color how many rotors it has

2304
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,560
its weight its size dimensions

2305
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,400
all of these things could be publicly

2306
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,239
accessible so that other

2307
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:55,600
registries can go and look this

2308
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,360
information up based on the serial

2309
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,000
number

2310
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,119
and before michael comes in uh

2311
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:03,199
stu is on the queue and i imagine he's

2312
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,480
going to elaborate or

2313
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,080
correct me because i might have said

2314
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:08,639
something wrong

2315
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:12,159
yeah i just wanted to uh give danielle a

2316
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:12,560
bit

2317
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,840
more of an answer on dns we don't

2318
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,000
anticipate that dns will be

2319
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,440
extensively used to do

2320
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:25,280
lookups of the actual information that

2321
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,360
is associated in these

2322
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,840
different registries with these

2323
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,480
different

2324
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,960
uh identifiers that are used as unique

2325
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,639
keys in those registries

2326
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:37,679
we do see a role for dns however in

2327
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,159
getting you from one registry to another

2328
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,719
so for instance given a hierarchical hit

2329
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:43,199
um

2330
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,480
which is the registry in which

2331
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:48,080
you should be able to look up other

2332
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,760
information that could come from dns

2333
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,840
okay thank you yeah uh

2334
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,840
schwein

2335
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:02,480
adam uh just one of the things i wanted

2336
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,400
to bring up in

2337
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,960
uh general aviation right now if you

2338
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:08,080
actually file

2339
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:11,600
a flight plan faa does give you a

2340
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,880
general warning where the

2341
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,000
ues activities is but there's no way

2342
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,440
they are showing

2343
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:23,119
either the uh june number

2344
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:24,639
or whatever the number it is but it

2345
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:27,119
generally basically details tail number

2346
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:28,880
so in those numbers you're showing right

2347
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,719
now you have the serial number

2348
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:33,679
make model certification you know what

2349
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,600
kind of number do you foresee

2350
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:39,679
can be used in that purpose see if we're

2351
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:40,960
gonna show you okay this

2352
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,440
jung zero number which number is

2353
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,960
actually flying in

2354
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,560
what uh attitude

2355
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:53,119
give me a minute to digest that um so

2356
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,080
somebody just give the

2357
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:56,480
the the thing about satisfaction you

2358
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:59,600
know okay if you type a tail number

2359
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,679
uh you will see where this aircraft

2360
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,560
is flying right now currently what's the

2361
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,800
fly plane they have filed

2362
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,560
and who belongs to and i would foresee

2363
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:14,000
in the near future

2364
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,400
zhong could be the similar right if you

2365
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,040
fly

2366
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,400
we have fly so probably know where the

2367
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,600
drone

2368
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,480
is flying right now and the data

2369
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,440
associated with satm data format

2370
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:30,320
so i'll fire a shot i see stu and rob in

2371
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,920
the queue i think stu

2372
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,400
has the answer the direct answer for you

2373
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,480
but i'll say that the tail number

2374
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,320
that you're talking about is what i

2375
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,480
think i've marked as the ua registration

2376
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:42,000
number i think the faa is moving away

2377
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,440
from that and going to be using session

2378
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,520
ids and not so much the ua registration

2379
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:48,719
number to be

2380
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:50,880
passed around i'm not a hundred percent

2381
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:53,280
sure

2382
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,679
then that one's a problem right for the

2383
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:57,840
room don't even have a networking

2384
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:00,960
connection they don't have broadcast id

2385
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,480
that means the fa there's no way to tell

2386
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,440
to know like the details information for

2387
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,800
that group

2388
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,000
right it has to be like either i mean

2389
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,600
for everyone to know it has to be as i

2390
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,119
said if it's a session id it has to be

2391
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:16,159
networking connections

2392
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,320
right but broadcasts that they don't

2393
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,320
even have one

2394
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,560
so that means for georgia we need to

2395
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:23,920
find some way to

2396
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:26,400
connect together right it means

2397
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,760
currently we have a traffic across

2398
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:28,639
society

2399
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:31,520
could be a potential solution for that

2400
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,520
so i see bob and stu have dropped into

2401
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:35,119
the participants

2402
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,040
take stu first he may have the the

2403
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,520
correct answer better than me yeah

2404
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,840
i'll i'll answer in in several parts

2405
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,800
first the faa is strongly discouraging

2406
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,440
the use

2407
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,880
of registration numbers

2408
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,080
by anybody other than themselves

2409
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,520
they explicitly prohibit the use of the

2410
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,719
registration number

2411
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:59,920
as the uas identifier they

2412
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,520
don't prohibit but they strongly

2413
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,119
discourage you

2414
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:06,480
publicizing that number in for instance

2415
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,600
the free text

2416
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,800
self id message

2417
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,440
the information that the faa expects to

2418
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,480
be able to look up

2419
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,119
from either a session id by way of the

2420
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:17,920
serial number

2421
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,440
or from the serial number right from the

2422
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,360
get-go is first

2423
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:24,480
the ua registration number that'll have

2424
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,840
a bunch of information about the

2425
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:26,800
aircraft

2426
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:29,040
including to whom it is registered which

2427
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,560
then leads to the

2428
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:33,679
operator registry which has information

2429
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:34,880
about the operator

2430
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:37,119
but both of these are essentially static

2431
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:39,600
information not dynamic information like

2432
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,760
an operational intent which is the utm

2433
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,360
term for a flight plan

2434
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,639
so interfaces between this and utm are

2435
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:49,920
expected to exist but as yet undefined

2436
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,159
and not required by the current rule

2437
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:57,280
and i will add to that um

2438
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:01,119
that there is a conflict that we are

2439
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:01,760
seeing

2440
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,080
that stu is pointed out between what the

2441
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:06,080
faa says they want to do

2442
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,719
versus what another section of faa is

2443
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:09,600
doing

2444
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,960
uh but the

2445
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,840
there is going to be a separation we

2446
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:16,719
don't know what

2447
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,960
what tail numbers are going to be moving

2448
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:19,840
forward

2449
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,520
um will the tail numbers for uas

2450
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,080
be the same as tail numbers currently

2451
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:27,760
and for manned aircraft

2452
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:30,239
or they can be something else this is a

2453
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:31,760
gray area

2454
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:35,119
and we have an ability here again to be

2455
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:36,159
inserting

2456
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:39,679
some um rational thought processes

2457
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:44,400
into it right yeah so by no means

2458
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,719
trying anybody that the diagrams i've

2459
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:47,760
just

2460
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:48,960
the three diagrams that i've just

2461
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,119
presented over are set in stone

2462
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,560
they are not they are basically throw it

2463
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,520
at the wall

2464
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:58,080
for what we know right now try to make

2465
01:40:58,080 --> 01:40:58,880
it all fit

2466
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:02,159
and see where we landed and then try to

2467
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,239
feed back to michael and work with

2468
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:05,600
michael to get

2469
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,840
something that is actually usable and in

2470
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:09,199
a registry up

2471
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:12,239
somewhere um so that was

2472
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:14,960
this is all nebulous at the end of the

2473
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:15,760
day

2474
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,760
um so i'll go to the next slide and i'm

2475
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,360
handing it back to michael and i think

2476
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:23,119
he's going to talk about some legal side

2477
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,480
stuff now which should be very

2478
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:25,679
interesting to maybe spark some

2479
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,440
discussion

2480
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:31,119
yes uh thank you adam so uh we had heard

2481
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,400
earlier about the faa uh punting on

2482
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:35,840
cyber security as

2483
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,360
as i referenced the eu um has actually

2484
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,040
uh dove into the deep end of the pool um

2485
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,679
rather aggressively um as i referenced

2486
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:46,480
um

2487
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,360
uh this is this is the eu cyber security

2488
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:49,920
directive

2489
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,840
it's nis ii a draft of this was released

2490
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,360
late in december um there is talk about

2491
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,560
trying to finalize this sometime this

2492
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:01,119
year

2493
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:04,360
although there needs to be through um

2494
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:06,800
negotiations between the parliament and

2495
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:07,760
other aspects

2496
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,520
this is probably something that's going

2497
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:11,040
to be

2498
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,159
probably 18 months to 24 months before

2499
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:15,600
it finalized

2500
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:18,880
there is still some uh drafting going on

2501
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,440
um but there are two um there are two

2502
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,840
things that i i want to key on regarding

2503
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,119
this cyber security

2504
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,159
uh directive um annex one

2505
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:31,520
and annex uh annex one identifies what

2506
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:32,320
they call

2507
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,600
essential services and there are two

2508
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,840
essential services that are specifically

2509
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:39,040
enumerated

2510
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,639
um that really requires uh our attention

2511
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,920
the first is number two a um

2512
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,719
and it talks about air transport now

2513
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:49,840
right now

2514
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,239
um the way this is written is this is

2515
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:53,600
primarily about

2516
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:57,040
manned aircraft but they do talk about

2517
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,400
uh air traffic management um and

2518
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,119
given that the europeans are a little

2519
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:04,960
behind the u.s and where they are with

2520
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,199
their drone regulations

2521
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:11,119
it would not surprise me um if this

2522
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:14,560
this definition or annex was

2523
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,360
uh potentially expanded to include

2524
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:18,080
drones

2525
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:21,440
um independent of that specific

2526
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:24,880
enumerated provision in annex one

2527
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:27,840
there is another paragraph it's uh

2528
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:28,800
number eight

2529
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,800
and it talks about uh digital

2530
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,400
infrastructure

2531
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:35,199
and here digital infrastructure talks

2532
01:43:35,199 --> 01:43:35,679
about

2533
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:39,040
pld registries um which if in fact we

2534
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:39,920
were to use

2535
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,840
a tld for this would potentially

2536
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,560
fall within this definition there are

2537
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,280
also

2538
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:50,800
other um provisions there are other

2539
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,320
enumerated services

2540
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:55,600
under the digital infrastructure um

2541
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,960
uh a bucket uh in annex one that talks

2542
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:00,800
about trust services

2543
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,400
um cloud providers um so i think

2544
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,440
when you look at where we are going with

2545
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:10,880
uh the broader uh drone

2546
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:14,000
uh program the utm i think that

2547
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,199
uh the ability for this to fall under

2548
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:20,800
either 2a or under 8 um

2549
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,719
i would say is is prob probable possible

2550
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,239
highly likely again still in flux but

2551
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:29,520
this is something you

2552
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:32,840
definitely want to keep your eye on next

2553
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:34,719
slide

2554
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,920
please there are so what i want to do

2555
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:38,880
real quickly

2556
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,760
is um i want to touch on a number of

2557
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,800
articles

2558
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,719
contained in the uh current nis2

2559
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:49,520
uh directive to call your attention on

2560
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,320
because

2561
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,280
um i do believe that they directly inter

2562
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,199
potentially directly intercept with the

2563
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:56,480
work that we're doing

2564
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,600
um so article 23 um

2565
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,199
was originally uh inserted um

2566
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:06,400
by uh by dg connect

2567
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,520
as a result of some of the pushback that

2568
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:10,320
has

2569
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,440
resulted as a result of the gdpr and the

2570
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,239
blocking

2571
01:45:14,239 --> 01:45:17,760
of underlying uh who is information

2572
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:20,800
um and associate and associated in

2573
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,280
association with certain domain names

2574
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:26,080
um so if you go here they talk about

2575
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,760
imposing upon the

2576
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,719
tld registry operator the ability to

2577
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:31,280
collect

2578
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,840
and maintain accurate information the

2579
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:34,560
ability

2580
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,920
to um make this um available

2581
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,440
upon a lawful and uh dually justified

2582
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:44,480
request from legitimate access providers

2583
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:48,000
so um i think as we look at how

2584
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,360
privacy intersects with potential

2585
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,400
access to pii associated with certain

2586
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,239
drone operators

2587
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,600
article 23 is something that you

2588
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,239
definitely want to potentially uh keep

2589
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:03,040
an eye on

2590
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:06,080
as as this moves towards uh

2591
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:10,719
final implementation next slide please

2592
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,040
now article 18 um this is where

2593
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:18,080
cyber security cyber security risk

2594
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,360
management measures

2595
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,760
are specifically enumerated and

2596
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:22,560
paragraph

2597
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,159
one basically imposes an obligation

2598
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,560
on all of those essential services so

2599
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:30,320
remember i was telling you about

2600
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:33,600
annex one um

2601
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,719
number two and number eight um if in

2602
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:37,440
fact you

2603
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,880
fall within this requirement um

2604
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,360
you have to take appropriate and

2605
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,400
proportional

2606
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,880
uh technical measures to manage your

2607
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,639
cybersecurity risks

2608
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:50,719
um regarding the security of your

2609
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,199
networks and the informations therein

2610
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:56,239
um so again i think this

2611
01:46:56,239 --> 01:46:59,760
uh is is potentially uh relevant in what

2612
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,719
we're doing

2613
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:04,639
um paragraph two um talks about a

2614
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:07,600
number of non-exhaustive measure

2615
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,400
measures

2616
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,040
that need to be included and what caught

2617
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,199
my attention specifically was

2618
01:47:13,199 --> 01:47:17,760
was uh 2d of article 18 where they talk

2619
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,440
about the supply chain

2620
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,600
and i know some of the discussions that

2621
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,440
uh we have talked about

2622
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:26,719
within um within this group is

2623
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:28,960
this this whole idea of a supply chain

2624
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:30,239
being able to

2625
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:32,400
track things uh you know from the

2626
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,000
manufacturer line

2627
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,280
point of sale to actual registration um

2628
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:37,840
so

2629
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,880
i think the scope of 2d

2630
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:44,159
um is is something that is relevant

2631
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:47,199
and and also needs to be looked at

2632
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:51,839
next slide

2633
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:56,480
so um this is so why is this important

2634
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,520
um why it's important is

2635
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,920
administrative fines so as everyone

2636
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,480
knows through the gdpr um

2637
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,639
you know part of the paranoia within

2638
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:07,679
businesses

2639
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:09,840
and and why that garnered so much

2640
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:10,800
attention

2641
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,960
was under the gdpr there was the

2642
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,080
potential of

2643
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:17,199
a 20 million euro fine or

2644
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:20,159
four percent of global turnover um what

2645
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:21,040
is interesting

2646
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:24,400
is under article 31 if the

2647
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,199
paragraph four talks about a violation

2648
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:28,400
of article 18

2649
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:32,000
which was that cyber security uh uh

2650
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,560
a component that i was just referencing

2651
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,880
if there is a violation of

2652
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,040
article 18 by one of those essential

2653
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,320
service providers

2654
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,000
they are potentially looking at an

2655
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,840
administrative fine of

2656
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,800
10 million euros or up to two percent of

2657
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:47,360
total

2658
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,920
uh worldwide annual or turnover

2659
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:51,440
whichever is higher

2660
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:54,719
um so again um if in fact we

2661
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:57,440
are going to be you know looking at this

2662
01:48:57,440 --> 01:48:58,320
i think that this

2663
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,400
is something that we need to be paying

2664
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,600
attention

2665
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:04,239
next slide

2666
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:08,880
and for those that are like i'm not in

2667
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,400
europe i'm only

2668
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:13,440
i am a non-european entity or i'm only

2669
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,440
selling or you know i'm just going to

2670
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:17,280
focus in the u.s or

2671
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:20,400
in asia pacific south america um much

2672
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:21,760
like the gdpr

2673
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,960
had an extra territorial provision

2674
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,360
um uh the nis directive has a similar

2675
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:32,480
uh extra territorial provision so if you

2676
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,119
are if the goods and services that you

2677
01:49:35,119 --> 01:49:36,080
are providing

2678
01:49:36,080 --> 01:49:39,440
are targeted to um uh

2679
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:43,199
the european uh union or

2680
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:46,320
businesses or individuals they will in

2681
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,360
fact

2682
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:51,119
exert uh jurisdiction over you

2683
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:55,119
um your company um under this provision

2684
01:49:55,119 --> 01:49:58,400
so i think this uh again is is

2685
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,840
interesting it's something uh to closely

2686
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,960
follow as uh over the course of the the

2687
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:05,520
next say

2688
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,800
12 to 18 months this is finalized um

2689
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:10,159
perhaps in parallel

2690
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:12,239
with some of the the the drone

2691
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:13,360
regulation so

2692
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:16,080
i think that is it for my presentation

2693
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:19,520
if i could go to the next slide i think

2694
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:23,599
we're done yes we're done so

2695
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:30,880
the registry stuff it has been in

2696
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:33,280
flux for a long time it's finally coming

2697
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,520
back to the forefront and we're

2698
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,119
actively trying to pursue it there's a

2699
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,040
lot of legal stuff going on in europe

2700
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,960
that we're now aware of

2701
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:43,199
and we're fine we're trying to get

2702
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,480
rubber onto the road

2703
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,520
and get it really going now now that

2704
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:48,560
some other things are

2705
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:51,760
starting to clear up so help

2706
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:54,800
drafting appreciated conversation on the

2707
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,639
list

2708
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:59,360
because we need it

2709
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:04,239
that's it

2710
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,159
um maybe i i have one question um

2711
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:11,520
so you mentioned denise nis um

2712
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,280
i'm just wondering if there are any

2713
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,760
considerations related to the digital

2714
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,760
service act

2715
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,960
or is that completely independent no

2716
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,760
there are actually provisions under the

2717
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:24,719
i

2718
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:27,119
this is the iatf i i was trying to wear

2719
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:28,800
more of my engineering hat instead of

2720
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,159
the lawyer hat but yes

2721
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:32,239
um if you want there are implications

2722
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:35,040
with the dsa as well as the dma

2723
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:39,280
um under uh the dsa there are provisions

2724
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,320
um that talk about safe harbors where uh

2725
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,360
the tld

2726
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,880
or dns operators can potentially

2727
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:50,159
qualify for immune uh if you will a

2728
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:51,840
liability exemption

2729
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:55,040
um so if you want um i could perhaps

2730
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:56,639
provide that information

2731
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:59,599
uh to the list but yes uh i think where

2732
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:02,719
you look at the european union right now

2733
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:05,360
much like they did with the gdpr in

2734
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:06,159
providing

2735
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:08,800
thought leadership in the area of data

2736
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:09,520
privacy

2737
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:12,639
and establishing global standards um

2738
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:15,280
i think you see the same thing here

2739
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,440
which with the dsa

2740
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,560
the dma as well as the uh nis

2741
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,760
uh nist ii uh cyber security directive

2742
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,360
so i do look at them all as

2743
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:26,639
complementary

2744
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,320
um and uh interconnected

2745
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,719
thank you

2746
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,520
any other comment

2747
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:44,239
um i'm not seeing any comments so

2748
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:46,239
i think we have been through all the

2749
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:47,760
presentations

2750
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,880
we've addressed all the questions

2751
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:53,920
we have no more questions um

2752
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:56,719
maybe one question we may go back is how

2753
01:52:56,719 --> 01:52:58,080
we move on the work

2754
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,520
further do we think

2755
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,679
um that interim meetings were useful

2756
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:08,719
and do we want to have those um

2757
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:12,800
for the next months coming months

2758
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,159
a basis of one per month might be a nice

2759
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:17,520
try

2760
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:19,840
so that's a question i'm raising for the

2761
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:26,159
five minutes that are left

2762
01:53:26,159 --> 01:53:29,199
yeah adam go ahead

2763
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:34,000
so interims one a month would not be a

2764
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:34,560
terrible

2765
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,560
plan i think when we had the interims

2766
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,639
going we were making good progress

2767
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:41,360
on a lot of the documents it kept us all

2768
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,960
on our toes and kept us pushing

2769
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,920
forward um and i think with the registry

2770
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,119
draft

2771
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:49,280
to get it up just you know up to speed

2772
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:50,880
where everybody else is i think that

2773
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:51,520
would be

2774
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,480
useful and you know instead of four of

2775
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,080
us sitting in a room

2776
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,000
yelling at each other maybe having 20 of

2777
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,679
us in a room

2778
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:02,960
virtually yelling at each other we might

2779
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,360
get

2780
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:05,280
a little bit more it might be a little

2781
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:06,880
bit more annoying but

2782
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,440
i think it would be good then keeping it

2783
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:10,639
enclosed within

2784
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:12,560
because right now it's been me michael

2785
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:14,800
stew and bob

2786
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,679
back and forth to get where we are now i

2787
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:19,679
think opening it up and

2788
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:21,119
getting the arc we think we have a good

2789
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,440
architecture we start iterating over

2790
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:27,360
expanding it contracting it etc

2791
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:30,960
okay anyone um so

2792
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:35,040
so you you if i try to sum up you

2793
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,719
thinking that having internet meetings

2794
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:39,440
is going to be useful

2795
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:44,960
yes i believe once again would be useful

2796
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:51,840
anyone think it's not going to be useful

2797
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:01,280
so i'm hearing known i don't know matt

2798
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:05,840
do you want to add something

2799
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:07,360
not specific on this on the on this

2800
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:10,080
point about the the interims but yeah

2801
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:13,199
we just a comment is that we um

2802
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:15,520
recently we we stopped to organize the

2803
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,280
interims because we wanted to i would

2804
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,119
say to put more focus on the um

2805
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:20,320
on the writing of the documents

2806
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:21,840
basically the requirement and the

2807
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:22,960
architecture

2808
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,639
um so now if we are confident that we

2809
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:26,320
are making progress on this one so yeah

2810
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:26,880
we can

2811
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,199
we can we can can go back and yeah and

2812
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:33,839
organize these meetings yeah

2813
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:39,119
okay so i think we can return the

2814
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:39,840
meeting
