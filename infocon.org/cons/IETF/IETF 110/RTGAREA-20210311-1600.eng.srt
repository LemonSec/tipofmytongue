yeah so this is um it is already a

34
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
minute past the hour so i guess we're

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,720
going to start

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,079
this is a joint meeting between the

37
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,200

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,159
routing area

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,640

move forward um

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,319
here we go so this is probably the most

72
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,840
ads we've ever had

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,959
at the same time sitting up front um

74
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,480
this is uh deborah's last

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,959
meeting as a.d even though the official

76
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,920
turnover was

77
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,799
uh last night at the plenary but we

78
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,000

first meeting at sad welcome john we're

81

very happy to have you here

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
so this is not well um it applies to

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,040
contributions it applies to behavior

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,239
that you have inside the atf so please

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
read the bcps at the bottom

86
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
we have been showing some extra links to

87
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
running your wiki the directorate for

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,720
for quite a while we don't have any blue

89
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,840
sheets anymore because they're

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
automatically filled

91
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
by meet echo we're always

92
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,720
open to getting feedback from

93
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,840
any of you either directly to us

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,159
in the open meeting you know privately

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,120
on email whatever you want

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
you can come to us individually as a

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,160
group um

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,519
you can get feedback about me for

99
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,919
example to the other ads or whatever you

100
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,720
want

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
we're interested not just in our own

102
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
individual performance but

103
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
also on how the area may be working

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,120
better or could work better

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
what things could could be enhanced what

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
can be changed

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
etc this is probably the only or one of

108
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,639
the only ways we

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,759
ever get get feedback the nomcom does

110
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,479
give us feedback every year but

111
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,320
that is usually kind of sparse as well

112
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,240
a big part of our job sads is to review

113
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,039
documents and take them to the process

114
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,320
please please please

115
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,000
review the documents um

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
we expect working group discussion

117
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,600
working with review

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
the chairs to participate there are

119
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,759
shepherds directorates

120
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,039
you can request uh early early reviews

121
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,080
from

122
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
uh please review the documents so that

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,919
we can uh increase the quality of the

124
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,440
documents as they move

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,199
through through the process

126
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,680
so this is the agenda for today uh again

127
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
for the first hour

128
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
normal

131
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,120
area status then we're gonna have luke

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,840

working group updates

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,759
um we decided that instead of going

137
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,600
through three minutes or a minute

138
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
or every working group we're going to

139
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,880
give a little bit more time

140
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
to in this case these five working

141
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,319
groups and they're going to spend i

142
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,440
don't know maybe around five or six

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,039
minutes each

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,440
talking about their working group what's

145
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,639
interesting

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,759
um etc and then we have time before the

147
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,960
hour is over

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,400
we're gonna go into uh open discussion

149
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
or any other business

150
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,520
that anyone may want to bring in

151
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,880
if anyone wants to please

155

342
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,480
now that john is uh taking over

343
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
so this is the new list john is taking

344
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,399
over most

345
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,199
of what deborah used to have and we

346
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,639
highlighted here in red

347
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,440
the the sort of exceptions so he's also

348
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,560
taking lsr

349
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,920
that uh i used to have um i'm taking

350
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,480
lisp

351
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
from deborah and rtwg and

352
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,880
martin uh got mpls and pals

353
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,959
from the board as well so this is the

354
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,000
new distribution

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
so you know who to talk to if you need

356
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,560
an id uh or as i said before

357
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,920
you can talk to any of us if you need to

358
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
give feedback about

359
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,319
us or the area in general

360
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,639
okay so we're going to go into the

361
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,959
writing directory report

362
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:36,880
look i'll hand it out to you

363
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
sure thank you um

364
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
so i'm just gonna present uh i think two

365
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
or three slides just a quick

366
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
uh quick overview of the writing

367
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,680
directorate uh

368
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,720
role so they um on the next slide you

369
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,800
see basically the directorate consists

370
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
of approximately

371
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,519
uh you know 40 to 50 routing area

372
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,720
experts

373
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,880
uh so these experts are appointed by the

374
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
ads

375
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,160
uh to help and basically perform um

376
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,480
routing area uh you know reviews of

377
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,359
drafts

378
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,039
that are going through typically through

379
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,880
itf last call

380
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
but also um uh

381
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,919
these experts sort of jump in and

382
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,679
provide routing expertise to

383
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,799
other areas on routing related drafts

384
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,119
uh and occasionally also provide uh

385
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,640
basically

386
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,120
uh early reviews of routing area working

387
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,799
group documents even before a working

388
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,720
group last call

389
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
so in essence the goal of this

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
directorate really or these reviews

391
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,520
within the directorate

392
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,840
is to encourage cross-pollination of

393
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,360
routing knowledge

394
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,600
and expertise across all the working

395
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
group

396
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,640
in the routing area uh so on the next so

397
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,240
there's a quick link to the wiki here of

398
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,520
the um

399
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
i think i so i think the the 44 experts

400
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
the 44 currently are listed on this

401
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
uh on this wiki uh on the next

402
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,399
slide

403
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,240
so we compiled actually 80 compiled a

404
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,000
few statistics of the work done

405
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
uh on these reviews so

406
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,960
obviously stats always speak for

407
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,039
themselves uh or rather you can make

408
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,720
them say what you wanted to say

409
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,799
uh but i think what's worth highlighting

410
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,720
here is um

411
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,480
first of all the sort of increase or the

412
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
the pickup of reviews in these last

413
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
three uh

414
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
you know virtual itfs so there was a bit

415
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,120
of a slowdown

416
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,400
as people were trying to figure stuff

417
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
out but other than that

418
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,559
um what's important to highlight on the

419
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,840
right

420
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,400
is uh i think the blue portion of the

421
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
horizontal graph bar is important here

422
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
so these represents early review of

423
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
drafts so these are drafts that are not

424
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,000
even that last call in their respective

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
working groups

426
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,000
and uh what you'll see is that only

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,760
really four or five working groups take

428
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,080
advantage of this

429
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,280
tool that's being offered to them

430
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,039
next slide

431
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,960
so this slide i think really highlights

432
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,600
the value out of these routing areas

433
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,880
reviews uh especially on the right

434
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,679
you'll see that 61 of these non-area

435
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,559
reviews

436
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,760
uh come back with have issues uh

437
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,320
and sort of to sum up i think that shows

438
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
the merit of these reviews

439
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,480
since the goal you know the end goal

440
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,240
really is to improve document

441
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,799
quality uh so i would encourage really

442
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,320
everybody and the chairs

443
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,799
to to keep calling these early reviews i

444
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,240
know it's a heavy workload on the

445
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
i guess the voluntold experts by the

446
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,000
area chairs but

447
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,400
they do have a definite benefit

448
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,120
thanks a lot

449
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,918
thank you look anyone have any questions

450
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
okay uh so yes definitely thank you so

451
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,039
much to everyone who serves in the

452
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,559
writing directorate

453
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,760
um the other reviews that you make help

454
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,440
definitely increase the quality of the

455
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,640
documents as they go through

456
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,320
so as i mentioned before we're gonna go

457
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,720
um through some working group updates

458
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,000
we um asked five

459
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
different working groups this time to

460
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
provide a short update

461
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,720
um a little bit more than you know just

462
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,159
the the litany of

463
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,960
drafts that are being talked about uh

464
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
but not too much just to go into a deep

465
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,480
dive of what they're talking

466
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,600
uh in their respective working groups so

467
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,320
we're going to start with um

468
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
hi this is lou burger speaking for debt

469
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,919
net

470
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,280
um janice farkas is here um

471
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,360
and uh we we do have a tech advisor

472
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,559
from the tsv area that's a little unique

473
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
or unusual i'll talk about that briefly

474
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
in a moment um

475
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,840
also we have a secretary so we have a

476
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,039
lot of people involved in the working

477
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,600
group next

478
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,320
good to hear that good to know that i'm

479
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,760
being hurt um

480
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,200
so dettnet is

481
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
about providing deterministic services

482
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,799
over

483
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
closed administrative groups or

484
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,159
cooperating administrative groups

485
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,360
scope is not the the wild internet but

486
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,520
we do worry about providing services

487
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,120
over different technologies

488
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,360
this sort of gives you a map of the the

489
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,520
technologies we support

490
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,799
so we can do straight ip ipo over mpls

491
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,760
straight mpls

492
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,039
mpls over ip um we are worried about

493
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,880
time sensitive network that's coming to

494
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
us from um

495
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
the ieee so we can actually sort of do

496
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
an ethernet vpn so think of that as an

497
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,159
enhanced

498
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,200
enhanced evpn over

499
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,320
mpls and we can also use tsn as a sub

500
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,679
layer so there's a lot of mixing and

501
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,600
matching a lot of combinations

502
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,640
um each of the red items shows an actual

503
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,919
draft although those are we've published

504
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,360
our first set of documents so some of

505
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,880
those are now rfcs

506
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,320
and we have finished our core set

507
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,600
of data plane documents and most of

508
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
the rest of those are in the rfc so this

509
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,039
gives you a map of where our technology

510
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,080
is

511
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,520
one of the key things is we are

512
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,760
operating on existing data headers we're

513
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,159
not

514
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,000
we haven't defined anything new although

515
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,679
we are using what we call a

516
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,720
net control word which is um sort of the

517
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,480
other control words that you'll see

518
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,320
uh in use with mpls and i think we're

519
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,520
going to be talking about a little more

520
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,640
tomorrow with

521
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
a nice joint group with pals that

522
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
they'll talk about next

523
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,720
um so that looked like a lot of work

524
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
done which is great

525
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,760
and so what are we doing next we do have

526
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
an informational document talking about

527
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,480
queuing implications there's been some

528
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
discussion about maybe us doing more

529
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
than that

530
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,360
there's we are wrapping up

531
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,559
our management model our yang model that

532
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,440
covers um everything but the tsn part

533
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,799
that you saw in the previous slide and

534
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
that's why that previous slide tsm was

535
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,679
marked as future

536
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,919
so that's also a really important yang

537
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,840
model from our standpoint

538
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,679
and we're working currently on oam

539
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,720
and controlled plane

540
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
our controller plane so one of the

541
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
things with detnet is we want to work

542
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
either with a fully distributed control

543
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
plane or centralized one

544
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,559
and to sort of say we don't care we came

545
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,159
up with a new term called controller

546
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,400
plane which is a superset

547
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
maybe that was a good idea maybe not

548
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,679
time will tell but

549
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,279
when you see controller plane it's not a

550
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,120
typo we actually mean

551
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
that it is it can be either a

552
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,559
fully centralized fully distributed any

553
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,960
combination of those

554
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,279
next

555
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,400
so we thought that it would be

556
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,880
worthwhile pointing out um in this group

557
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
that we we do an awful lot of

558
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,360
coordination

559
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
in debt net with other groups you saw

560
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,360
the technologies we're involved with

561
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,320
um i'll i don't know chairs if you want

562
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,080
i'll i'll spend a couple minutes on each

563
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,760
of those but i think i've been talking

564
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,600
my five minutes um

565
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,720
do you want me to keep going or do you

566
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,960
want me to stop uh sure i think we're

567
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,320
okay i think we're uh running a couple

568
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,600
minutes early actually so

569
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,080
okay great let's keep going so we'll

570
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,120
talk about some

571
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,480
the the ones that we identified we

572
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,760
thought would be interesting next slide

573
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,000
please

574
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,760
so um the raw group is

575
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,200
really um a

576
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
a group that we're closely cooperating

577
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,400
with because

578
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
their scope is and you're going to hear

579
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,440
about them

580
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,559
is to work with that net over wireless

581
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,520
technologies

582
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,200
strictly speaking our charter allowed

583
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,520
for work on wireless technologies but we

584
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,279
thought it would be really good

585
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,720
if there was a place that

586
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,159
had that focus and in particular brought

587
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,440
in new

588
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,559
new blood so we are

589
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,360
worrying about the overall data plane as

590
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,240
well as

591
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
um adapting to wired data planes and

592
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,840
um in the wireless space we're working

593
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,679
closely with with the raw working group

594
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,120
we're meeting with them about every

595
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,840
other week next

596
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,600
spring is interesting you'll notice that

597
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,279
in the

598
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,039
document list that we had we talked

599
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,799
about running over

600
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,240
tsn mpls ip but we

601
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,159
didn't call out sr and we've had a

602
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,080
number of documents that have said let's

603
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,400
do

604
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,919
debt net over over sr

605
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,480
and those documents have shown up

606
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
typically in both working groups

607
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,679
and we've been um trying to coordinate

608
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:00,320
with those

609
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,360
chairs on which drafts should go where

610
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,039
and we sort of have a working proposal

611
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,200
it's not finalized but that

612
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,200
if we're using existing sr formats

613
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,720
they're going to end up in detnet

614
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,320
if it has any type of new format

615
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,399
that'll go to spring next

616
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,559
i mentioned before that we are lucky

617
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
enough to have a

618
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
transport area um uh

619
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,440
advisor technical advisor this was

620
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
something that was supported

621
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,240
proposed by the tsvad a while back

622
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
and we weren't quite not we weren't

623
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,080
quite sure how good an idea it was

624
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,440
but it turned out to be excellent and

625
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
what it's meant that as we are

626
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,600
progressing our documents and and

627
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,200
looking at the different issues we have

628
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
someone in the room who can provide us

629
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,000
really good feedback from the tsv

630
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,679
perspective to make sure that what we're

631
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,279
doing is going to be

632
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,799
um aligned with uh

633
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,559
just sort of the normal ip

634
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,159
diff serve considerations and

635
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,440
um having this early and often allowed

636
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,320
us to

637
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,640
get through the isg review i think in a

638
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,520
fairly uh

639
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
good way and of course that was because

640
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,559
we had

641
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,440
addressed the the issues so that was

642
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,240
really great

643
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,799
um we have had one question recently

644
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,279
about new queuing mechanisms there have

645
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,640
been some proposals

646
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,840
to do completely new um queuing

647
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,440
algorithms queuing mechanisms on the

648
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,559
device level

649
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,039
to date detnit has said we will talk

650
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,080
about other

651
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,760
qe mech queuing mechanisms that are

652
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,120
standardized elsewhere

653
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,640
and how you might use them for detnap

654
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,679
but we're not defining queuing

655
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,200
mechanisms and to my knowledge

656
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,960
the routing area has never defined

657
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,799
queuing mechanisms

658
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,799
so it's certainly out of our charter to

659
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,919
do that but there's

660
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,760
um a question of where should this be

661
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,679
done the

662
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,960
tsv working group in particular david

663
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
has

664
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,440
has made comments publicly that if it is

665
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,320
um a new queuing mechanism where it's

666
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,640
only that net specific maybe tsv isn't

667
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,159
quite the right area to do it it might

668
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,159
be better to do it in debt net

669
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,720
so we have an open question um really

670
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
it's going to end up to the ads

671
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,760
um uh to to sort of make a decision

672
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,159
on where this work uh should be done so

673
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:22,799
that's a

674
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,919
a an open question that um you know i

675
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,240
don't

676
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
expect us to discuss it today but uh i

677
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,480
do expect that we'll see an answer on

678
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,039
this

679
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,440
in hopefully not too long um next

680
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
uh i see torrelis is in queue uh chairs

681
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
you want me to

682
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,000
yeah i was just about to ask if you want

683
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,760
to take questions as they come or if you

684
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,960
want to hold

685
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,159
i'm i'm happy it's your time

686
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,760
uh i'd say let's do it as they come

687
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,360
tourless

688
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,039
yeah i just wanted to back on fire you

689
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,399
know i think one of the biggest

690
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,440
achievements

691
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,679
in that net at least from from me

692
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,200
looking at use cases it

693
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
is the pre-off which is kind of you know

694
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,679
the uh

695
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,600
also what i would consider more like a

696
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
transport qs function to you know

697
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,279
eliminate duplicate packets with

698
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,399
sequence number

699
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,080
something you know sequence number we

700
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,320
also uh you know

701
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,679
i don't think had that much in the

702
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,679
routing area um so

703
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,880
i i i think um you know where

704
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,760
wherever it falls i i i don't see the

705
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,919
the queuing to be particularly different

706
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,240
from

707
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,679
you know the work that was done in

708
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
pre-op

709
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,200
so um i i that's a good point if we back

710
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,799
on that first slide we talked about the

711
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,159
net control word um we use the

712
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,399
standard.net control word including the

713
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,000
sequence numbers that were previously

714
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,640
defined in the

715
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,440
net control word uh sorry in the uh

716
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,320
standard

717
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,640
control word that was used both in pals

718
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,799
and in evpn

719
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,159
we use it to provide basically one plus

720
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,679
one protection for those of you who've

721
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,960
been active in

722
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,200
um sort of the more transport-centric

723
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,240
areas of the

724
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,080
uh routing area you'll be familiar that

725
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,480
we've done one plus one protection for

726
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,840
uh various technologies in um

727
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,799
in the past debt net defines it for

728
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,720
today for mpls and

729
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,520
um using the those sequence numbers and

730
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:15,919
maybe

731
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,640
in the future um uh for ip as well

732
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,840
uh thanks for the comment for us

733
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,279
dean this is sorry same topic

734
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,360
on the tsn so this reason why i just

735
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,000
joined the q

736
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
q i'm happy to give my comment after you

737
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,159
do the tsn

738
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,520
uh oh okay great thanks um so i thought

739
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,720
it'd be worth mentioning

740
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,159
the uh tsn group in particular so

741
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,520
time sensitive networking is a activity

742
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,880
in as it's a task group um inside the

743
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,919
ieee

744
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,640
uh we're really fortunate to have great

745
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,559
cooperation between the ietf

746
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,000
and ieee on this my co-chair jana

747
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,440
sparkos is

748
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,559
both debt networking group co-chair and

749
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,279
tsn

750
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,880
task group chair so by having um

751
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,240
uh this people actively contributing in

752
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,320
both groups we've we've really been able

753
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:16,880
to

754
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,120
have great alignment there uh of course

755
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,399
they also have the

756
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,360
iabs activity of ieee coordination so we

757
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,039
have both at the formal level and the

758
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,240
informal level

759
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,720
it's been really great um we held one

760
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,519
workshop

761
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,720
in uh in bangkok in 2018

762
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
we had planned to do another joint

763
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,200
workshop in 2020 but obviously that was

764
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,000
canceled and

765
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,039
we hope to do it again in the future um

766
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,360
tsn is an important technology it's a

767
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,440
underlay technology which gives us a lot

768
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
of queuing mechanisms that we can

769
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,679
reference

770
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,760
it is not a requirement though for net

771
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,880
uh net is designed to operate over any

772
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
type of um let's call it subnet layer

773
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,320
uh dan

774
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,120
i wanted to ask if you i've seen uh

775
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,080
several comments

776
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,200
between tsn and ptp

777
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,760
and in some of the implementations uh

778
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,279
there were some

779
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,279
issues there were some

780
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,559
there there are some um unknowns uh

781
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,640
between one and the others so um

782
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,480
the have you had uh any touches with the

783
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,679
ieee 1588 group on the same topic

784
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,679
so um we had discussions on this

785
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,880
early on that you know would we need to

786
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,080
specifically describe

787
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,080
time synchronization in um in debt net

788
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,679
and i think you'll see some of that in

789
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,360
our use cases and maybe some of our

790
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,559
early documents

791
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,600
but as we went on we concluded

792
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,840
that that is typically sort of a layer

793
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,320
below um uh the routing layer

794
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,720
and if you're talking about time

795
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,559
synchronization across

796
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,720
um a device that usually happens sort of

797
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,480
at the hardware level

798
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,840
and that we didn't have to do anything

799
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,000
specific for it so

800
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
that hasn't been an area where we've

801
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,519
spent a lot of attention recently and we

802
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,519
didn't it's not at all

803
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,559
in our data plane definitions um

804
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,000
you know as you know there's there's

805
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,480
some good profiles talking about

806
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,559
uh and i can't remember if it was itu or

807
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,559
ieee that had the profiles

808
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,600
of um of different types of devices we

809
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,720
would hope that a profile would be

810
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,919
written for

811
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,039
um for a router that's that not aware

812
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,600
but we didn't see that as in our scope

813
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
um you know that said we are

814
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,880
contribution driven so if you think

815
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,159
there's something we're missing

816
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,919
at the net level please bring it to the

817
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,600
working group

818
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,640
yeah okay i'll that i i i think

819
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,399
i see a few of them based on the

820
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,918
customer conversations thank you

821
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,679
uh i think that was my last slide but

822
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,039
just uh next

823
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,000
just in case yeah uh thank you so much

824
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,679
thank you on to raw

825
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
hello hi can you hear me this is eve

826
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,560
schuler

827
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,280
and um i'm one of the co-chairs of raw

828
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,839
and

829
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,199
unfortunately my co-chair rick taylor

830
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,520
is uh chairing another session at this

831
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,800
exact time so

832
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,079
he sends his regrets um as

833
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,079
lou said we are next slide

834
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,280
we are a sister group

835
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,320
um to detnet we're about a year old

836
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,679
and the intent was to ensure

837
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,960
that we could extend

838
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,159
net to comprehend wireless layer 2

839
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,599
technologies

840
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,839
um and what we mean by that is to

841
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,918
support these deterministic properties

842
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,040
mostly around

843
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,400
bounded latency packet loss or packet

844
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:00,960
errors

845
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,599
and consecutive errors across l2 bridged

846
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,599
in l3 routed segments

847
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,760
and although the dettnet charter does

848
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,960
talk about heterogeneous support

849
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,839
because of all of the layer 3

850
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,560
technologies

851
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,680
the the intent here was to ensure also

852
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,040
seamless operation across wired

853
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,200
and wireless subnets um and

854
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,680
so that is our focus is really on what

855
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,119
is the relationship between

856
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,599
layer 2 and layer 3 to support the

857
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,960
wireless

858
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,800
um the obviously as you get into

859
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,680
wireless

860
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,960
the um

861
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,040
to support to claim that something's

862
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,240
deterministic becomes

863
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,880
increasingly difficult uh because of all

864
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,000
sorts of issues

865
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,320
not least which is interference so how

866
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,119
do we make

867
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,040
the wireless technologies highly

868
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,480
reliable and available

869
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,680
and approximate determinism uh even if

870
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,440
we can't give as strong assurances as

871
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,240
our wired

872
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,359
counterparts so the four technologies

873
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,079
that are in

874
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,040
charter are basically wi-fi six and

875
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,079
beyond

876
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,280
um the time slotted channel hopping uh i

877
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,839
triple 802.15.4

878
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,720
uh standard which in the ietf has been

879
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,440
known

880
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,599
uh as sixtish uh as a working group name

881
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,640
uh the obviously there's tremendous

882
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,680
focus on 5g

883
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,760
support in at least the part of the

884
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,280
discussion around ultra reliable low

885
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,560
latency communication

886
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,720
or you are llc and a fourth technology

887
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,839
which doesn't get as much um

888
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,680
air time so to speak which is the

889
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,200
l band digital aeronautical

890
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
communication systems

891
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,000
known as ldax which is ground to air in

892
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,200
air-to-air communication

893
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,119
uh and so you know this is something

894
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,800
that is our fourth

895
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,920
technology of consideration we do work

896
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,640
very closely with debt net um this was

897
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,040
spun

898
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,599
out to try to attract some of the

899
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
wireless experts that might not show up

900
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
to debt net

901
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,359
given its name and that this really very

902
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,320
specifically

903
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,760
uh focuses on wireless but we

904
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,079
as lou indicated we meet very regularly

905
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,599
the participants

906
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,760
we meet regularly between co-chairs the

907
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,839
participants in both the groups you know

908
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,520
tremendous crossover

909
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,480
and we're even coordinating on documents

910
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,359
to ensure

911
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,040
that we have consistency for example

912
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,839
for some of the newly arrived oam

913
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,200
documents

914
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,960
between the groups next slide

915
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,160
you've seen this in this picture but to

916
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,960
remind you

917
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,160
that our relationship is

918
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
to to be considered just you know

919
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,640
another technology alongside of ethernet

920
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,680
uh to enable some of these technologies

921
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
for example

922
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,760
uh work with the tsn shim that was

923
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
alluded to in the previous

924
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,800
uh report out others not so much

925
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,160
but potentially in the future so um

926
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,119
there is this nice layering of and

927
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,280
concern about how does

928
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,920
the layer 2 technologies and layer 3

929
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,960
technologies

930
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,000
cooperate to deliver determinism next

931
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,240
slide

932
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,200
when we were launched which predates me

933
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,880
we have this ambitious goal the charter

934
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,400
had an ambitious goal to

935
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
more or less support for foundational

936
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
informational documents

937
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,400
and to do so in about 18 months we've

938
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,680
been around for about

939
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,800
a year now since the last time this uh

940
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,359
the routing area supported an open work

941
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,160
group

942
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,359
um meeting and uh

943
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,880
what i will point out here is that um

944
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,040
three of these documents foundational

945
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,560
documents were all about

946
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,880
uh meant to be sort of foundational and

947
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
a fourth

948
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,880
was and still which is really the thing

949
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,280
that's

950
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,640
uh mostly uh in our long-term

951
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,960
uh something that because we have not

952
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,240
started as yet

953
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,280
is to really evaluate the existing ietf

954
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,119
technologies in the gap analysis

955
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,760
you'll see in the in the upcoming slide

956
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,320
that

957
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,160
we're just beginning to get into that

958
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,839
stage and we have spent the

959
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,400
the last year really trying to figure

960
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,200
out

961
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,839
our foundational documents and um what

962
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,960
is the story line

963
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
next next slide

964
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,640
i stated in that fashion because if you

965
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,000
look at how det net has unfolded

966
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
it did a great job it's been a long time

967
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,079
uh kind of getting its

968
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,200
foundational rf which are now rfcs

969
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,079
correct

970
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,320
in order that it sort of accelerated

971
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,760
into producing

972
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
um really the specifications that are

973
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,200
rfcs now

974
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,200
and so we wanted to uh

975
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,680
really mimic that behavior and we have

976
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,400
focused

977
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,359
on whereas debt net had a problem

978
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,480
statement use cases

979
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,280
architecture draft we've started out as

980
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,800
well with a use cases

981
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,599
um document where we've highlighted all

982
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,079
the scenarios that might require

983
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,200
a raw technolo a raw approach

984
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,240
reliable reliable available wireless

985
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,400
the attendant technologies the four

986
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,480
technologies that contribute to this

987
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,599
to the discussion and um get ourselves

988
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,160
to

989
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,359
some kind of architectural uh position

990
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,440
statement or framework document

991
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,800
and so we've spent quite a bit of

992
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,079
time and and i should say that there

993
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,079
were several buffs before the year this

994
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:42,720
just

995
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,040
didn't come out of uh nowhere as many of

996
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,000
you know

997
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,119
um pascal had been uh working on

998
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,440
in this area for quite a long time under

999
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,200
the auspices of debt net

1000
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,640
and so we had quite a few documents uh

1001
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,680
ready for um uh discussion

1002
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,359
and consideration so our use cases doc

1003
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,680
is uh just like the debt net dock it's

1004
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,960
fairly high level

1005
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,319
and it has fairly high level

1006
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,880
requirements uh our technologies dock

1007
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,839
has done a great job to articulate the

1008
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,200
concerns of each of the

1009
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,760
four technologies under consideration

1010
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,240
and

1011
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
unfortunately and i and i think this is

1012
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,160
um in part uh

1013
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,280
you know some of the oh

1014
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,839
i'll call it um there's a little bit of

1015
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,040
an allergic reaction

1016
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,400
to documents that are um

1017
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,640
you know position statements or inform

1018
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,760
some of the informational

1019
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,520
information that's needed to set the

1020
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,880
stage so there was

1021
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,760
um some concern around articulating a

1022
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
problem statement but each of our drafts

1023
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,599
now already include a problem statement

1024
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,599
and so we're likely to extract it and

1025
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,920
after all uh have a problem statement

1026
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,800
draft

1027
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,160
and um we're at a point where our

1028
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,000
architecture we're re-jiggering our

1029
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,760
architecture and framework documents to

1030
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,240
go from sort of a specific

1031
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,280
to go from these uh you know what we'd

1032
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,480
really like is have an architecture

1033
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,240
document that's very generic and then

1034
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
framework documents that are that are

1035
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,000
more specific to the technologies

1036
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,839
next slide

1037
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,280
in addition to our foundational

1038
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,200
documents we

1039
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,720
have uh begun to have some really

1040
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,520
interesting conversations about the the

1041
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,440
glue

1042
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
between different technologies that

1043
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,480
already exist

1044
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,839
that would help us coordinate between

1045
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:36,720
layers

1046
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
dlip being one of those technologies

1047
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,800
that's already in rfc

1048
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,599
the dynamic link exchange protocol and

1049
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,960
it has some efficient

1050
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,240
characteristics in that it's an

1051
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,800
event-driven uh protocol

1052
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,040
so uh less overhead that would

1053
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,839
monitor layer two link characteristics

1054
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,680
but also expose them and share them with

1055
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,720
layer three

1056
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,359
and this is really the beginnings of

1057
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:01,760
that

1058
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,480
um elusive fourth foundational document

1059
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,880
uh

1060
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,200
around uh how do we get to our gaps

1061
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,560
analysis so this is

1062
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,319
uh we've got some early discussions

1063
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,680
around d-lab at this

1064
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,200
ietf we now have

1065
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,640
uh the an oam draft that

1066
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,040
has been separated into its requisite

1067
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,720
parts that

1068
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,480
one in debt net and rom they're both

1069
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,800
nearing working group adoption

1070
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,040
and our ldac's draft

1071
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,480
which was adopted by the working group

1072
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,400
is likely going into working group last

1073
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,599
call

1074
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,200
and we have had some new

1075
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,040
topic areas introduced the

1076
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,440
as you can imagine the reliable and

1077
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,119
available wireless is really important

1078
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,079
in industrial

1079
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,599
systems and an industrial iot

1080
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,760
and there has been a terrific new

1081
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,800
document

1082
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,319
that has upped the bar on how much

1083
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,680
detail we need for requirements in that

1084
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,640
area and

1085
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,040
additionally some metrics that would

1086
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,480
help us

1087
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,119
understand uh operationally these the

1088
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,119
various kinds of scenarios faced in

1089
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,640
industrial systems

1090
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,359
there and and i know that this you know

1091
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,960
the explicit ask

1092
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,359
for these presentations was you know how

1093
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:20,079
are we

1094
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,440
um coordinating with other groups and

1095
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,040
the there are a series of mec drafts

1096
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,920
and mec is an etsy driven

1097
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,000
initiative around mobile edge computing

1098
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,280
and so we've

1099
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,200
begun that discussion there we'll see

1100
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,560
where that leads

1101
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,560
and additionally although it was not um

1102
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,280
presented in our working group at this

1103
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,680
ietf there was this segment routing

1104
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,640
inspired tsn draft that did get air time

1105
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,200
in

1106
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,000
in that net and and other working groups

1107
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,359
at this itf which we

1108
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,880
um anticipate uh will at least in some

1109
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,800
regards get uh folded into

1110
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,160
our um if not discussions then um our

1111
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,319
milestones or at least for consideration

1112
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,560
uh and i think that oh maybe next slide

1113
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,520
i'll this

1114
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,280
the next slide is a summary of

1115
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,200
everything i've said on oops

1116
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,160
on this slide which is really where our

1117
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,359
documents are

1118
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,119
um we finally have one working group

1119
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,119
last call couple nearing

1120
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,720
working group last call all of our you

1121
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,640
know the foundational docs

1122
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,599
um and so this is just the the pointers

1123
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,880
to those resources

1124
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,839
next slide

1125
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,480
and for further information

1126
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,400
great thank you any questions from

1127
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,839
anyone

1128
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,520
thank you

1129
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,400
right so this is stuart and i'm going to

1130
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,880
talk about

1131
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,760
some work that we're doing in pals or

1132
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,880
some

1133
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,599
an issue that arose from pals so next

1134
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,160
slide please

1135
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,760
so pounds is holding a meeting on friday

1136
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,839
at 12 o'clock utc

1137
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,119
with jointly with debt net mpls

1138
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,560
and spring to discuss a number of recent

1139
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,839
proposed changes to the mpls

1140
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,319
architecture

1141
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,400
there have been recently been a cluster

1142
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,520
of

1143
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,720
proposed mpls changes there have been a

1144
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,240
number of proposals to add

1145
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,440
metadata under this after the stack

1146
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,800
there's been a proposal to add metadata

1147
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,839
in the stack there have been a number of

1148
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,440
proposals to create

1149
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,880
new extended special purpose labels or

1150
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,240
even

1151
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,280
i'm not sure in some cases to use a real

1152
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,839
reserved label real special purpose

1153
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,119
label

1154
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,480
and there's also been a a rather

1155
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,640
interesting proposal to repurpose

1156
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,240
some of the special purpose label bits

1157
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,839
next slide please

1158
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,040
so why pals why did power of the cluster

1159
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,720
why did pals pick this up

1160
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,280
um well we were the first working group

1161
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,359
to deploy metadata below the bottom of

1162
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,119
stack the

1163
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,559
pseudowire control word so kind of we

1164
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,319
noticed it

1165
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,400
um net copied the approach that

1166
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,720
we used and this commonality

1167
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,760
in the two designs in both cases there's

1168
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,839
only a single control word below the

1169
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,280
stack

1170
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,520
um new there are there are some new

1171
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,319
proposals

1172
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,480
that would require more than one set of

1173
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,960
metadata below the bottom of stack

1174
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,440
and this leads to potential

1175
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,680
complications

1176
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,520
so what we feel we need to do is

1177
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,680
uh to make sure that the addition of

1178
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,760
other metadata does not break

1179
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,440
or change any of the existing protocols

1180
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,319
or if it does we want we need to know

1181
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,160
how the behavior changes

1182
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,079
what the constant consequences are what

1183
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,839
the costs are and what the mitigations

1184
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:16,400
are

1185
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:21,839
so next slide please

1186
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,079
so why um do we raise this right

1187
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,240
none of the proposed changes themselves

1188
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,520
are are large

1189
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,000
or um or significant however

1190
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,880
in combination there is the result is

1191
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,480
complexity

1192
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,680
the result is a change in the mpls

1193
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,200
uh forwarding model a very simple

1194
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,399
model so far that

1195
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,240
we would reluctantly see increasings

1196
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,040
increase significantly in complexity and

1197
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,920
of course

1198
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,599
if these changes which are simple in

1199
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,040
themselves

1200
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,079
in themselves or in combinations

1201
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,720
um if we get it wrong then they may

1202
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,079
fundamentally limit

1203
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,079
mpls development in the future so this

1204
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,839
is all about going into this

1205
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,880
um with an open mind

1206
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,040
but nonetheless understanding what the

1207
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,440
consequences are what we do are

1208
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,119
so the plan is to get the interested

1209
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,119
parties together on friday

1210
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,200
uh to to do three things one to

1211
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,760
understand the needs to understand

1212
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,920
that underpin the various proposals that

1213
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,200
have have come together in this cluster

1214
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,680
to understand the proposals themselves

1215
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,040
understand some of the proposals

1216
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,319
themselves i'm not sure we've unearthed

1217
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,160
all of them yet

1218
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,079
and to develop a way forward that

1219
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,920
deliberately changes the mpls

1220
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,920
architecture to a model that meets the

1221
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,720
new needs

1222
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,240
we don't want the protocol to to stall

1223
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,440
or become ossified so it needs to meet

1224
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,760
future needs

1225
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,160
but we don't want to discover that in

1226
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,000
meeting the short-term needs

1227
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,040
we have boxed ourselves uh into a corner

1228
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,200
as a result of a set of uncoordinated

1229
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,160
changes

1230
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,920
so it's about bringing all the

1231
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,000
interested parties together

1232
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,960
understanding what the new needs are

1233
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,280
understanding the various proposals

1234
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,079
and then formulating a way forward we

1235
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:18,960
won't do

1236
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,680
all of that by any means in the two

1237
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,800
hours we've got on

1238
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,440
friday but we can start this process and

1239
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,440
then discuss with the ads and other

1240
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,160
chairs

1241
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,559
how we would go forward afterwards i

1242
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,599
think that's my last slide

1243
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,040
thank you stuart any questions

1244
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,480
if not this is tomorrow at noon noon

1245
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,520
time utc thank you so much on spring

1246
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,240
hello bruno speaking next slide please

1247
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,598
so i'm going to talk about spring

1248
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,040
do you hear me yes we do

1249
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,640
okay so what is spring

1250
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,760
spring stands for source packet routing

1251
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,520
networking and is better known for being

1252
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:13,839
the

1253
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,119
the home of segment routing

1254
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,440
the three main piece of work we have

1255
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,880
done so far

1256
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,760
is a segment rooting architecture that

1257
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,359
we published in july 2018

1258
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,480
then we have two data plans first

1259
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,760
is the segment in nprs data panel

1260
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,920
publishing published in december 2019

1261
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,319
and then the segment rooting for ipv6

1262
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,559
data plane

1263
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,000
consists in two documents first

1264
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,599
the ipv6 and packet extension

1265
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,599
segmenting header extension published in

1266
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,160
march 2020 so the work has been done in

1267
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,240
six man

1268
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,119
and then the srv6 network programming uh

1269
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,240
published in

1270
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,439
february 2020 so a few weeks ago

1271
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,400
next slide is so that that being

1272
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,400
done um the current hot topic

1273
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,520
is uh to try to work

1274
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,800
on reducing the size of the ip packet

1275
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,240
header

1276
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,359
for sr over ipv6

1277
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,720
so what we have today is a srv6 user

1278
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,079
segment i don't if you have using a

1279
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,920
128 bits addresses

1280
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,640
for many use cases we only need a few

1281
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,559
segments

1282
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,280
but as the number of segments increase

1283
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,760
the size of the other increase

1284
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,079
which involves the hardware challenges

1285
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,119
and traffic override

1286
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,079
so so far we have multiple individual

1287
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,000
solutions being proposed

1288
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,599
to so-called compress header

1289
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,960
what we really mean is to use a smaller

1290
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,079
segment identifiers

1291
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,520
and each solution

1292
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,480
is proposing to define extension in

1293
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,680
different working groups

1294
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,879
such as six-man lsr idr spring and pc

1295
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,839
so far we could not have natural

1296
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,400
convergence

1297
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,880
so we have a very different starting

1298
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,839
positions

1299
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,160
so some people believing that we should

1300
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,160
start with srv6

1301
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,760
and try to minimize the evolutions

1302
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,440
and some people believe we should try to

1303
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,079
start with the srmps over ipv6 and

1304
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,559
minimize the evolution

1305
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,800
and some people believe we should start

1306
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,240
with a new a new design

1307
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,119
with a newer ip6 header or headers

1308
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,720
and we have a strong positions

1309
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,319
next slide please

1310
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,280
so we've created a design team in june

1311
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,680
2020

1312
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,960
it does this task to create or

1313
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,319
probably produce two documents one is a

1314
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,559
list of requirements

1315
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,000
for the solution or solutions

1316
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,280
and second a document

1317
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,280
comparing the different solutions and in

1318
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,400
particular against

1319
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,119
the requirements

1320
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,680
so we have a very good involvement from

1321
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,359
the design team a lot of work

1322
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,760
yet the planning accurately exceeds

1323
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,440
the original plan time frame

1324
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,720
latest status in this ietf the design

1325
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,799
team reported to a six-man

1326
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,000
and spring workouts

1327
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,480
they publish an update of the

1328
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,599
requirement document

1329
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,880
version of five so publish presented and

1330
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,160
they have just asked for

1331
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,759
uh adoption work adoption

1332
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,119
and they also present

1333
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,079
the first version of the of the analysis

1334
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,520
document

1335
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,880
so it has been published presented

1336
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,200
so far it is a very preliminary

1337
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,799
so no i would say no detailed analysis

1338
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,640
and the rough plan for the design team

1339
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,720
is to complete the analysis by late

1340
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:32,799
may by complete analysis i guess it's a

1341
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,200
complete first first session of the

1342
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,680
analysis as a feedback for the working

1343
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,919
group

1344
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,720
next one please

1345
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,599
another significant topic is the sr

1346
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,359
policy architecture

1347
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,079
it's a big part of the segment

1348
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,240
architecture

1349
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,599
it is being referenced by 96 documents

1350
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,799
out of them 9 37 being normative

1351
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,599
so must not have most of them most

1352
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,119
notably theory

1353
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,960
it is being referenced by 10 idea

1354
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,480
working documents

1355
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,599
four pc work documents two

1356
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,920
mps working documents and two teas

1357
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,400
working with documents

1358
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,400
and it will be last called soon

1359
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,000
it should be uh in a couple of weeks

1360
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,240
april next one i believe is the

1361
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,640
last one next slides

1362
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,720
and finally a recent subject

1363
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,760
regarding the intercollection of domains

1364
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,839
with multiple planes

1365
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,799
so in this subject each domain

1366
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,119
may have multiple planes i mean igp

1367
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,160
planes or

1368
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,880
planes within the domain to enforce

1369
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,040
multiple objectives

1370
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,920
typical goals uh would be to have a one

1371
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,440
pen for shortest path

1372
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,480
another one for lowest delay another

1373
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,079
could be a

1374
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,200
only high i bound with links

1375
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,240
another could be uh not rooted over via

1376
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,079
whatever you you want or don't want

1377
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,760
each domain uh may use any any

1378
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,119
choice for its uh local enforcement of

1379
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,760
the planer so typically it would be a it

1380
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,000
could be sr policies

1381
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,720
or srfxlgo or rdpte

1382
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,200
so the question is the export service

1383
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,760
spanning multiple

1384
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,079
there is a need to build the coherent

1385
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,280
inter-domain

1386
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,559
routes sticking to each plane

1387
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,480
within each domain so in itf

1388
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,680
110 so this one we have seen

1389
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,880
presentation in

1390
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,359
its presentations in spring idr and base

1391
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,920
working groups

1392
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:03,040
we have a set of documents about use

1393
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,480
cases requirements

1394
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,319
architecture and extension

1395
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,119
we have two uh sets of uh two solutions

1396
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,400
with two set of

1397
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,720
documents so so for example in spring

1398
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,839
today we had those two documents

1399
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,599
presented

1400
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,000
so that's all uh sets up for spring

1401
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:36,960
thank you bruno are there any questions

1402
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,200
okay so i guess we're on to the last

1403
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,439
part

1404
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,480
i'm uh this is stark i'm going to give

1405
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,359
you the update

1406
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,480
on the mpls uh working group

1407
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,839
status can i go ahead

1408
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,880
yes please go okay thank you

1409
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,160
just a quick note before i start talking

1410
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,440
uh the update is on the behalf of my

1411
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,119
co-chairs as well and

1412
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,160
we have uh a secretary matt chen

1413
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,000
as well in our working group um

1414
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,400
let me just mention that stewart has

1415
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,359
done a great

1416
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:22,480
job setting the stage describing the

1417
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,839
problems of mutual interest between mpls

1418
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,319
and pals

1419
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,400
i will go through a couple of them as

1420
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,359
well it might

1421
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,839
sound uh repetitive

1422
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,480
nevertheless some of the topics that

1423
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,599
working group

1424
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,720
is paying special interest in uh

1425
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:47,839
uh are starting with the special

1426
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,799
requests for

1427
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,920
uh allocations of uh

1428
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,400
this scarce resource we have it's called

1429
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,760
the special purpose

1430
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,640
label space and new applications are

1431
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,440
popping up

1432
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,839
uh and asking for uh new allocations uh

1433
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,480
um we're trying to manage these requests

1434
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,920
uh and then

1435
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,720
choosing uh should it be in the extended

1436
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,520
special

1437
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,240
purpose label space or does it

1438
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,240
necessitate the

1439
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,520
very scarce label a label space of the

1440
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,640
special purpose label

1441
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,599
there are also multiple proposals to

1442
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:28,720
embed identifiers within the packet uh

1443
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,920
to to distinguish for specific purposes

1444
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,319
this

1445
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,680
network slicing or for uh path

1446
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,240
identification uh for example in segment

1447
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,200
routing

1448
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,319
uh there is a need for identifying

1449
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,960
packets belonging to a specific path

1450
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,359
um there are other instances as well

1451
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:48,240
that

1452
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,760
uh you know identifiers are needed

1453
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,000
and at least we have three proposals uh

1454
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,280
three drafts were presented early on

1455
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,920
monday and we're going to have to

1456
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,520
agree on a proposal to move forward with

1457
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,400
so some of them are proposing that the

1458
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,720
identifiers be in the label stack

1459
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,359
within the mpls label stack some of them

1460
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,000
are

1461
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,119
proposing that identifiers sit after the

1462
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,480
end of stack or

1463
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,319
the bottom of the stack um

1464
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:27,440
there are proposals also uh in mpls

1465
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,400
working group to

1466
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,760
uh uh repurpose uh

1467
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,400
uh actually the uh jumped one one bullet

1468
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,680
here is um

1469
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,720
uh to use a special purpose label to

1470
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,599
alert

1471
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,040
um the transit lsrs of the presence of

1472
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,000
metadata

1473
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,280
after the bottom stack um

1474
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,079
so again we we are trying to see if

1475
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,040
there is a

1476
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,520
chance for generalizing this kind of

1477
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,200
alert mechanism

1478
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,240
rather than giving for every

1479
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,000
request a new special purpose label

1480
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,520
lastly there is a request that we extend

1481
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,839
or

1482
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,599
enhance the uh the purpose of existing

1483
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,200
special purpose labels

1484
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,000
that are already allocated and there's

1485
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,640
hardware support for them

1486
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,319
possibly to reuse them for new

1487
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,079
applications

1488
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,520
i do mention two of them the uh

1489
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:28,240
the generic associated channel label the

1490
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,039
gal

1491
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,680
and entropy label indicator uh these are

1492
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,079
already allocated reserved labels

1493
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,480
there are proposals to you know

1494
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,799
piggyback on those or enhance

1495
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:41,359
the capability they can provide by

1496
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:45,038
carrying additional information

1497
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,839
next slide please

1498
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,400
so it was mentioned earlier that there

1499
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,640
are there is a joint meeting happening

1500
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,440
on friday session one um

1501
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,119
the the focus of this meeting is to

1502
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,039
ensure that any extensions in mpls

1503
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,480
uh working group do not conflict

1504
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,960
uh with the existing features supported

1505
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,839
by

1506
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:18,000
pals as was mentioned by steward

1507
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,839
we need to understand the new

1508
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,280
requirements so the new requirements

1509
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,880
popping up from network slicing and

1510
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,559
other things i mentioned

1511
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,079
uh will be uh will be discussed

1512
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,640
and then we will try to agree on a way

1513
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,920
to move forward

1514
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,839
uh in such a way that we don't limit

1515
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,119
ourself as

1516
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,680
steve mentioned as well and be backward

1517
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,960
compatible

1518
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,359
um i apologize i don't have too many

1519
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,160
colorful

1520
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,440
slides and i i did compose two slides

1521
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,240
only and this is my last slide

1522
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,920
but there will be an interesting uh

1523
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,680
discussion tomorrow i promise you

1524
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,480
in the morning session so i do encourage

1525
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,599
everybody to join if they can

1526
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:01,440
thank you thank you tarek

1527
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,079
so um unless there are any questions uh

1528
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:04,480
we're

1529
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,599
on to our last slide

1530
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,640
uh but we're already over time

1531
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,240
um so i guess what i want to do is

1532
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,480
uh finish the running area part of the

1533
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,520
meeting and

1534
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,240
hand over a presentation to

1535
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,480
rtwg

1536
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,839
uh okay thank you i will try to uh

1537
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:41,839
share the slides for the rgtwg meeting

1538
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,960
something is coming up

1539
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,000
okay good good

1540
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,359
let's see how this works

1541
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,559
so before we start we will do chairs

1542
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:10,240
bashing and everything else

1543
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,079
during tomorrow's meeting today we go

1544
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,599
directly into presentation

1545
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,799
uh correct i have the agenda for today

1546
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:19,680
here

1547
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,520
and we're yeah we're going to do the

1548
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,880
status

1549
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,400
update in tomorrow's meeting

1550
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,440
so for today we have uh first

1551
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,559
presentation is from

1552
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,680
adrian farrell about um

1553
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,440
sort of a request for for help working

1554
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,720
on

1555
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,280
some work on address semantics in the

1556
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:42,559
irtf

1557
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,240
and then shuping talking about

1558
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,920
presenting and trying to

1559
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,680
have some discussion about uh

1560
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,200
application and their aware

1561
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,359
networking so we'll uh we'll start with

1562
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:58,720
adrian's presentation

1563
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,400
and hopefully i can go to full screen

1564
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,839
mode here

1565
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,720
yellow's good

1566
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,559
oh not anymore we'll see

1567
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:19,839
until it settles down

1568
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,160
okay finally settled down in a good

1569
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,598
state i think good job

1570
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,280
okay thanks thanks for time on this

1571
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,319
agenda

1572
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,520
uh i don't want to take up too much time

1573
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,880
but just a

1574
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,280
a quick couple of minutes to flag up

1575
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:37,920
some work

1576
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,039
we're doing to investigate research

1577
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,799
related to the idea

1578
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,799
of changing or adding to the semantics

1579
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:49,119
of an ip address

1580
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,319
we wrote a draft in a bit of a rush

1581
01:06:52,319 --> 01:06:53,599
and we actually managed to get two

1582
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:55,680
versions out before the cutoff date but

1583
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,000
it was

1584
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,640
more words than we uh really could fit

1585
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,839
in the time

1586
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:04,000
so it's a bit rough um we're working on

1587
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,240
an update and restructuring it to make

1588
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:06,640
it

1589
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,760
readable and uh and meaningful and

1590
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,480
although we

1591
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,680
targeted this at the irtf because it's

1592
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,640
uh

1593
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,079
um really a research

1594
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,920
uh project uh it's obviously central to

1595
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,039
the uh the routing area um

1596
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:27,760
thanks to those who've already commented

1597
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,000
on the routine discussion list

1598
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,440
who's those who sent private notes um

1599
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,240
and a few of you that we've discussed uh

1600
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,920
in a bit more depth with over the last

1601
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,720
couple of weeks

1602
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,760
so uh what i want to do is quickly paint

1603
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,839
a picture of what we're looking at

1604
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,160
and tell you what we'd like from you and

1605
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,640
hopefully attract your attention

1606
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,839
to discuss this a bit further uh slide

1607
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:57,839
please

1608
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,119
so this is all evolving rather rapidly

1609
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,359
as we discuss but what we're trying to

1610
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:06,400
do basically is understand

1611
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,280
the implications for the routing system

1612
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,720
of this thing we're calling

1613
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,079
semantic routing and we're doing this by

1614
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,560
trying to catalogue

1615
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,960
the existing proposals and existing

1616
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,238
research

1617
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:23,679
and then formulate a list of questions

1618
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,920
that maybe researchers should be looking

1619
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:26,880
at

1620
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,880
what we're not trying to do is

1621
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,399
claim any support for

1622
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,479
any of these proposals and we're

1623
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,640
certainly not trying to come up with uh

1624
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,880
routine protocol solutions at this point

1625
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,080
in time

1626
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,479
so what do we mean by semantic routing

1627
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:48,959
slide

1628
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:55,040
um largely speaking

1629
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,719
we're talking about rooting on

1630
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,399
additional information

1631
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,158
so we've done this for uh forever

1632
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,679
um and really the pre-history of of

1633
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,839
routing purely on a destination ip

1634
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,279
address has uh

1635
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,120
has long passed us by um

1636
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,640
we've been uh considering uh a number of

1637
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,120
things inside the network to help steer

1638
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,238
packets

1639
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,439
and whether we've called that

1640
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,439
preferential routing or policy-based

1641
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:26,880
routing or flow steering or whatever

1642
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,679
next slide

1643
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,479
um so there there's a number of

1644
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:35,359
proposals

1645
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,399
kicking around that talk about encoding

1646
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,719
additional information into an ip

1647
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:41,839
address

1648
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:44,479
that's to say giving enhanced meaning to

1649
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:45,679
some of the bits

1650
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,040
of an ip address

1651
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,520
quite often this these proposals limit

1652
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,520
the scope of applicability they talk

1653
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,640
about

1654
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,760
a domain of of use and

1655
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,120
outside that domain everything is just

1656
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,159
an ip address

1657
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,400
inside the domain some of the bits have

1658
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,880
special meaning

1659
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,800
and to some extent this is not new

1660
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,239
so if you look at the way that prefix

1661
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,440
prefixes have been partitioned so that

1662
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,480
certain addresses have special meanings

1663
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,000
that is um in a way

1664
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,880
a semantic addressing thing but question

1665
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,000
is that

1666
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,560
the all there is or is there more next

1667
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,960
slide

1668
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,920
um so more recent proposals have done

1669
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,360
other things um and uh

1670
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,239
a very good example is the recently

1671
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,480
published

1672
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:51,199
8986 for srv6 network programming

1673
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:56,880
we've seen proposals to address

1674
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,320
service functions directly with ipv6

1675
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,360
addresses in service function training

1676
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,760
and there's a discussion around

1677
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,920
a form of icn that

1678
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,880
gives meaning to the address to to

1679
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,280
address

1680
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,199
content there's also a lot of discussion

1681
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,280
going on at the moment about variable

1682
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,520
flexible address links

1683
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,000
which might be useful in constrained

1684
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,880
environments

1685
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,239
there's been for a long time i think

1686
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,440
discussion about

1687
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,199
could we scope addresses hierarchically

1688
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,920
and therefore make simpler multi-domain

1689
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,159
routing

1690
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:44,800
and i think the latest incarnation of

1691
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,159
this i saw was

1692
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:50,400
for satellite routing

1693
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,400
and then there's a discussion of

1694
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,520
encoding additional information into

1695
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,960
some bits of an address

1696
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,760
in a way which is a bit similar to srv6

1697
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:03,280
network programming

1698
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,679
but it's just applied to a flat address

1699
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,360
with no concept of sr going on

1700
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,000
next slide

1701
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,719
so this one that one uh

1702
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,760
semantic routing then is rooting on

1703
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,239
addresses that have got this additional

1704
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,120
semantic

1705
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,320
uh inside them um

1706
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,600
with probably the intention that legacy

1707
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,560
nodes

1708
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:35,520
will survive uh the fact that the the

1709
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,000
addresses are semantic addresses

1710
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,400
but that new or enhanced nodes may be

1711
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,040
able to get additional routing function

1712
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,239
by looking at these addresses so on the

1713
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,400
left here i think the bottom is being

1714
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,000
cut off but the the left is prior art

1715
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,320
and it's showing how a routine decision

1716
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,040
is basically made on an ip address

1717
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,880
uh a pile of other information perhaps

1718
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,960
and some policy and configuration that's

1719
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,000
been put into

1720
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,800
the router and then on the right hand

1721
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,520
side

1722
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:11,679
is routing with semantic addresses

1723
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,880
where the other information that middle

1724
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,760
box

1725
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,600
may still be feeding into the rooting

1726
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,840
decision but mainly

1727
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,040
it's being placed into the ip address

1728
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,080
so that the routing decision is is based

1729
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,719
on that address without having to trudge

1730
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:29,120
through

1731
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,760
the other fields in the header and maybe

1732
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,719
doing dpi

1733
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:38,080
and so on and so on so next slide

1734
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,920
um so this is this is definitely a work

1735
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,840
in progress we scratch together

1736
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,120
some questions we think that need to be

1737
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,560
looked at when considering uh

1738
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,600
semantic routing

1739
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,239
and they inc include you know will this

1740
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,960
break the existing system

1741
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,320
and um will we need new software and new

1742
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,440
hardware

1743
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,840
uh can we actually handle this type of

1744
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,480
um

1745
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,320
processing in hardware does it scale

1746
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,719
uh do the claims that it helps scaling

1747
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,000
actually hold up or

1748
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,800
does it make things worse will more

1749
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,040
addresses need to be

1750
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,880
pushed into the network does it break

1751
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,199
additional existing additional functions

1752
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,960
like multicast

1753
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,440
and and bottom of that list is is do we

1754
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,520
actually need to standardize anything

1755
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,800
or is this tucked away in private

1756
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,440
uh domains that can just do what they

1757
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:38,159
want

1758
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:44,559
beneath a rootable prefix next slide

1759
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,120
so um what do we want from

1760
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,239
from you we're at the moment at a stage

1761
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,320
which you might call a literature review

1762
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,199
so we would love to hear pointers to

1763
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,239
relevant work

1764
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,480
and a lot of you have been doing that

1765
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,320
already for us thank you

1766
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,719
but i'm sure that there's research work

1767
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,880
out there that you know about

1768
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,080
um uh

1769
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,560
suggestions for additional research

1770
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,239
questions because that that list

1771
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,520
uh which appears in the draft is uh

1772
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,040
is a little bit thin uh and and probably

1773
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,719
not very well focused

1774
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,199
um but we're really looking at what

1775
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,679
could go what wrong with routing

1776
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,600
what problems should be people be

1777
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,440
researching how should they be going

1778
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,800
about that

1779
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,960
um what type of network should they

1780
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,520
experiment with

1781
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,520
um and that we at the moment we're not

1782
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:43,920
sure

1783
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,679
but we think that there's not a lot of

1784
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,239
ip rooting research going on

1785
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:50,400
um there's there's quite a bit of work

1786
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,360
on overlays

1787
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,920
but but we're not finding much on on

1788
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,280
routine

1789
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:58,159
possibly it's really well hidden maybe

1790
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:58,800
this is

1791
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,400
uh because the rog was was shut

1792
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,760
so long ago or maybe rooting is complete

1793
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,000
and

1794
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,920
and everything's been done and we can go

1795
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,360
home

1796
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,400
um and of course possibly it's because

1797
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:12,719
of

1798
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,920
uh funding issues and so forth

1799
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,800
so um we'd love to discuss uh i don't

1800
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,719
know whether the chairs want to take

1801
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:23,120
questions and discussion now but

1802
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,520
obviously you can email us

1803
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,199
you can mail on irtf discuss

1804
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,520
and probably the ads won't mind if we

1805
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,280
continue a bit on

1806
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,360
routine discussion as has happened

1807
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,360
before

1808
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,000
so thank you

1809
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,080
okay i think we're fine with taking a

1810
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,679
few questions um

1811
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:49,840
i think linda has raised her hand

1812
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,440
presentation look i'm curious the

1813
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:54,159
semantic

1814
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,440
address is a still ipv4 v6 or something

1815
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,679
different now there's ipv

1816
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:03,040
what is that another 6j ip addresses

1817
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,640
so what it is

1818
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,080
so what we're seeing

1819
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:13,280
is suggestions to impose semantics on

1820
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:17,840
chiefly ipv6 addresses

1821
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,520
we would be interested to hear that

1822
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,400
no this really needs to be off in a

1823
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,960
whole new address space that might run

1824
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,400
ships in the night or in a

1825
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:34,159
in a brand new internet but um i i'm not

1826
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:37,280
sure that um

1827
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,360
my focus anyway is beyond

1828
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:44,880
what would happen to ip

1829
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,520
routing and that's basically ipv6

1830
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:48,560
routing

1831
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,239
if this semantic address even goes ahead

1832
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,760
and second question what kind of

1833
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,080
semantics do you plan to add to it

1834
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,960
is any example okay so that's back to

1835
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,159
the slide that says

1836
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,400
we we don't we don't support any

1837
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,679
particular

1838
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,800
um uh ideas for

1839
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,199
uh semantic addressing we are just

1840
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:11,360
collecting proposals so

1841
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,159
other people have lots of proposals

1842
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:16,719
that's great

1843
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:20,560
but we um we want to research

1844
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,280
around those rather than push any

1845
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,239
individual proposal

1846
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,879
okay

1847
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,240
thank you

1848
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,349
[Music]

1849
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,120
uh okay thank you adrian

1850
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:45,120
okay uh now we'll switch

1851
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:48,320
over to uh shupeng

1852
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,080
let's see if i can just switch over

1853
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,400
to this presentation there we go

1854
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:00,000
i think uh so you can go ahead and

1855
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,199
unmute yourself hopefully yeah

1856
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:07,600
hi thank you okay well you're welcome

1857
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,320
good hi this is shuping i'm going to

1858
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,600
present apn

1859
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,719
the application of wire networking next

1860
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,040
please

1861
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,480
first about the purpose of this

1862
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,560
presentation here

1863
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,920
and actually we believe apn is most

1864
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,360
relevant to rtg area and we have

1865
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,600
presented a few times here

1866
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,440
and we have involved rtg in most of the

1867
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,640
apn

1868
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,800
discussions in the mailing list apm

1869
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,000
meeting list

1870
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,480
we can see the progress has been made

1871
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,360
and here

1872
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,640
we would like to further introduce the

1873
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,920
concepts clarify the scope and

1874
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,960
attract people attention to further

1875
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,560
address

1876
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:59,440
the main concerns raised by the iesc and

1877
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,640
to make the work

1878
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,280
to progress further and i will keep this

1879
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,159
presentation

1880
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:05,920
short and leave more time for

1881
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,080
discussions here

1882
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,280
next slides please

1883
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:16,800
so i will follow what why and how

1884
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,840
this logic to give this presentation and

1885
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,600
thanks to our ad

1886
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,600
who gave this suggestion and uh

1887
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,960
first so what is apn

1888
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,000
and apn is on that network layer

1889
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,600
and we want to enable

1890
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:38,239
the fine grain the user group

1891
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:40,239
application group and service level

1892
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,840
requirements guaranteed

1893
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,880
at the network layer and in order to do

1894
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:45,440
that

1895
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,000
we will develop a framework and set of

1896
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,360
mechanisms

1897
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:52,560
to derive convey and use an

1898
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,440
attribute and this attribute information

1899
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:56,480
is the key

1900
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:59,440
and it will be encapsulated in the data

1901
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:00,320
packets

1902
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,480
it will be treated as object in the

1903
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,600
network and

1904
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,280
two days the network operator can apply

1905
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,679
policies in the various nodes and

1906
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:10,719
service function

1907
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:14,320
functions along the path and here

1908
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:17,840
which is very important to note that

1909
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,120
apn works within a limited trusted

1910
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,080
domain

1911
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,679
and this domain is generally defined

1912
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,560
as a service operator's limited domain

1913
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,159
and within this domain

1914
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,880
the operators could support and could

1915
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,199
use their technologies to provide the

1916
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:36,400
services

1917
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,880
and as shown in this diagram it's very

1918
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,760
simple

1919
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,280
and the apin attribute is attacked

1920
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,800
are removed and removed at the edge of

1921
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:48,239
this limited domain

1922
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,560
so that means once the packets leave

1923
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,520
this domain

1924
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,639
it will be removed that won't

1925
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,360
cause could cause any impact to the rest

1926
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,000
of the

1927
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,639
internet next slides piece

1928
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:08,159
so what is uh equally important is

1929
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,679
what ap is not so apn is not

1930
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,159
about identifying the particular

1931
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,280
application

1932
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,840
of the users to the network or within

1933
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,120
the network

1934
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,000
the network doesn't even need to know

1935
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,840
this

1936
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:26,560
information and to know this information

1937
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,199
it will it will also break privacy and

1938
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:30,960
we are aware of that

1939
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:33,920
so it's all about policy enforcement in

1940
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,760
the network

1941
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,239
and also apn is not a penalty

1942
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,440
which is um the panargy is

1943
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,280
make the application aware of the

1944
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,760
network but we are the other way around

1945
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,040
we want to make the

1946
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:52,400
network aware of the application user's

1947
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,679
requirement

1948
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:57,120
so apn is now the smart and plus

1949
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:01,760
which carries in for the um

1950
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,560
the application information in the

1951
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,520
transport layer

1952
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,800
but we use the network layer so abn is

1953
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,440
not

1954
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,440
network tokens which is a tag

1955
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,000
which is tagging the tokens at the host

1956
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,679
or applications

1957
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:21,199
but we tag the attribute as the network

1958
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,440
edge device

1959
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,679
so at the end this is also the

1960
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:26,719
conclusion

1961
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:30,239
we derived from the one of said meetings

1962
01:23:30,239 --> 01:23:33,760
at ietf 108. that is

1963
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,639
to convey information at the different

1964
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:37,199
layers

1965
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:40,080
of different technologies and apn uses

1966
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:40,480
the

1967
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,519
network layer nicely slice piece

1968
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,960
so here why apn we use a very concrete

1969
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,400
but simple use case that's about ic1

1970
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:57,679
so in case in the case of icd-1 network

1971
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:58,400
operation

1972
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,199
operators can provide sorry guaranteed

1973
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,560
one lines

1974
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:06,719
to enable the an enterprise to access

1975
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,760
the cloud so

1976
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,159
when we map the one line into the

1977
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:13,679
operator's network

1978
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,239
so usually you will find multiple

1979
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:16,880
network

1980
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,840
paths available but they are they are

1981
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,480
these

1982
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,520
different sra guarantees

1983
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,040
and currently in the mef70

1984
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:30,159
there have already been a list of match

1985
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:30,960
items

1986
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,080
which are published and use these

1987
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,679
match items the edge device

1988
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,719
so here is cpe node could steer the

1989
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:41,440
traffic

1990
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,880
into the corresponding file lines and

1991
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,440
for example the match items could be

1992
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,600
five tuples

1993
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,880
but still there is a need to communicate

1994
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,040
user applications requirements to the

1995
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,520
network to match to the capabilities of

1996
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,320
the one line because once the traffic

1997
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:01,600
goes into the

1998
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,719
network there is still a need to apply

1999
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,080
various policies

2000
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:08,000
in the different nodes or service

2001
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,840
functions along the path

2002
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:13,120
to this traffic traffic flow so for

2003
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,000
example

2004
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,880
at the head end we need to steer into

2005
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:18,560
the corresponding path

2006
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,719
and which can satisfy the sre

2007
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:21,920
requirements

2008
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,199
as the main point we need to collect

2009
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:27,760
the performance data measurement data

2010
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:28,719
and

2011
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,000
also do some visualization and as a

2012
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,280
service function

2013
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,560
we could use it to we we would need to

2014
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,440
exaggerate the particular policies

2015
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,960
next slides please

2016
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,880
so we will see that um currently there

2017
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,400
is still no

2018
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,600
way to no effective way to

2019
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,639
to do this so probably that

2020
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,679
would be possible to stack those various

2021
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:02,400
policies

2022
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,920
in a list of trvs in the header of the

2023
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:06,960
each packet

2024
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:09,520
but you can imagine the big challenges

2025
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,440
that is going to be imposed on the

2026
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,719
hardware processing

2027
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,159
and forwarding and also when we

2028
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:19,440
do the policy-based routing along the

2029
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:20,080
path

2030
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,199
so normally people will use acr their

2031
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:27,760
well the five tuples but in some cases

2032
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,120
it's very complicated to resolve these

2033
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,080
five tuples

2034
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,920
so for example with the tunnel

2035
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,199
encapsulation

2036
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,159
it's very hard to resolve it and because

2037
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,280
the transport layer

2038
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,960
information it just pushed very down and

2039
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,159
it's very hard to gather and with ipsec

2040
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,040
so it's not possible to obtain any

2041
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,040
transformatory information

2042
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,480
and in the ipv6 data plane with

2043
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,960
extension headers so we know there are a

2044
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,159
list of the

2045
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:01,920
extension headers are being added

2046
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,280
so the transport layer is pushed

2047
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,800
very long and very deep so

2048
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,920
it's it's um sometimes it's not possible

2049
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,920
to have these five tuples within the

2050
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,360
network

2051
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,839
so next please

2052
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,400
so how so how we can solve the issues

2053
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,679
and we did some gap analysis there are

2054
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,159
some possible solutions

2055
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:33,600
and uh oh and here is the possible

2056
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,719
solution

2057
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:38,560
what we propose and

2058
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,480
we um propose to construct

2059
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,600
an attribute at the network edge and

2060
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,840
encapsulating the data packet and

2061
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,360
treated as the object

2062
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,480
in the network and to this the network

2063
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,199
operators

2064
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:55,440
applies the policies and provides

2065
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,480
services

2066
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:00,080
in the various places along the path so

2067
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,560
and the policy choice is according to

2068
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,400
the user application group

2069
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,840
and service level requirements so

2070
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,280
in this way it could bring several

2071
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,000
benefits

2072
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,960
for example it will improve the

2073
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,560
forwarding performance

2074
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,440
since before you need to yes you need to

2075
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,159
resolve the five tuples in the

2076
01:28:22,159 --> 01:28:25,679
different layers in the

2077
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,120
packet header but now you only need to

2078
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,040
look at the one field in ip layer

2079
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,320
which will also improve the scalability

2080
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,960
and also it will enable the very

2081
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,719
flexible policy enforcement

2082
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:42,560
in the various nodes and service

2083
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,760
functions

2084
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,120
and also it could enable

2085
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:51,120
more new services for example

2086
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,320
with sfc and

2087
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,639
you don't need to resolve the five

2088
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,199
tuples to do the policy enforcements on

2089
01:28:59,199 --> 01:28:59,920
the bus

2090
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,360
but only one field and also it could

2091
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,480
enable the fine

2092
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,520
granularity perforce management

2093
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,840
performance management and visualize

2094
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:14,000
visualization and also it's not only

2095
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,199
about underlay

2096
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:19,040
it could also work for the overlay

2097
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,000
so we can see that can be easily done by

2098
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,239
using this

2099
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:27,760
information but it's impossible with any

2100
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,560
of the current existing mechanisms

2101
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,840
so next please i'm going to take a

2102
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,840
moment to switch to full screen mode

2103
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,320
since this takes a couple of seconds

2104
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:39,920
i didn't want to do it in the middle of

2105
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,320
your presentation so

2106
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:46,480
just uh hopefully this will okay

2107
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,360
will be better okay yeah sure thank you

2108
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,440
you're welcome so okay

2109
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:01,280
okay so we did some gap analysis

2110
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,719
and there are some working etf already

2111
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,560
first about dscp but we know it's not

2112
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,400
big enough and then for the ipv6 flow

2113
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,280
label

2114
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,320
or npr essential fee label and

2115
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,040
it has been standardized to be used for

2116
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,960
the ecmp

2117
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,880
and for the sfc service id

2118
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:27,679
and that is defined to be used in the

2119
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:28,719
nsh

2120
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,679
context header but apn attribute can be

2121
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:33,199
carried in the various

2122
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,400
data plane that is decoupled from data

2123
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,360
plane

2124
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:41,120
and for the iom flow id that is used to

2125
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:44,480
correlate the exported data of the same

2126
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,159
flow from the multiple

2127
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:49,520
nodes and for the binding seat that is

2128
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:52,560
bound to the isr policy but the apn is

2129
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,120
not bound to services only

2130
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:58,239
and the flows backed label that is bound

2131
01:30:58,239 --> 01:30:58,560
to

2132
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:02,400
amperes but aping is not

2133
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,599
next a slice piece

2134
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,719
and so we can see that the existing

2135
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:13,199
solutions are specific to a particular

2136
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:16,159
scenario or data a data plane they are

2137
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:18,080
not the same as apn

2138
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,400
and so they are unable to achieve the

2139
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,600
same impact

2140
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,880
effects and also driven by the new

2141
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,679
services

2142
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,600
the fine granularity service for

2143
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,040
reasoning becomes

2144
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,800
also urgent so

2145
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,080
apn aims to define a generalized

2146
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:36,880
attribute

2147
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:39,199
used for service for reasoning within

2148
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:40,159
the network

2149
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:42,840
and can be carried in the various data

2150
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,639
plane

2151
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:48,400
thank you next please

2152
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:57,040
yes so here so during this week

2153
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:00,400
we have presented in the art and also

2154
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,520
the security

2155
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,199
area and that was a very good thanks to

2156
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:08,800
all the ads and the chairs and we

2157
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,520
have collected a very valuable feedback

2158
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:15,440
and i have a lot of very good

2159
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,280
discussions with the

2160
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:21,280
experts there and interestingly

2161
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:25,520
we found people having frequently asking

2162
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,120
some similar questions

2163
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,560
so that's why here we summarize um

2164
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,400
a list of the ifaq and just to

2165
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:38,000
try to make the clarification

2166
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
on people's concern and

2167
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,360
first so people ask whether there are

2168
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:45,840
any

2169
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,760
applications that can benefit from apn

2170
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,280
and to me that is a very easy question

2171
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:57,920
and so if i may i would like to ask

2172
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,120
have you ever experienced

2173
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,520
any medical issues during this ietf

2174
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:09,120
and any virtual ones before i would say

2175
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,639
that is the one of the

2176
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:13,679
exact application that can benefit from

2177
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,280
apm

2178
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:19,280
and also in this ietf we had a hacksaw

2179
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,120
application of our gi services

2180
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,320
networking

2181
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:24,639
that shows the improvements that can be

2182
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:26,800
achieved with apn

2183
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,920
and we have also published

2184
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,040
two papers in infocom this year and last

2185
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:36,639
year and both in the demo session

2186
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,920
and we have demonstrated um the

2187
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:42,960
the improvements that apn could achieve

2188
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,719
so here are some links for your

2189
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:46,239
reference so

2190
01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:49,280
second how apn can help resolve the qoe

2191
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,880
issues

2192
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,600
so when you go into the details you

2193
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:54,800
could see

2194
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,080
and the from the demonstrations

2195
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,480
you could see the difference of

2196
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,199
improvements

2197
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:04,560
that apn can make within the network

2198
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:07,199
and regarding the qoe that is very

2199
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:08,320
complex

2200
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,520
and itself has many impacting

2201
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,520
factors including the terminals

2202
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,960
access and also the network so apn

2203
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,320
aims to provide ways to improve the qoe

2204
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:25,360
within the network and then

2205
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,400
who is going to set the apn attribute

2206
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,440
so that is the network edge device such

2207
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,199
such as the cpe and it's not the

2208
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:37,280
application itself

2209
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,239
and then how to set the apn attribute

2210
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:42,080
there are many possible ways

2211
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,880
that can be used to classify the traffic

2212
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,440
flows at the network edge

2213
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:49,840
and for example the end tuples defined

2214
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,880
in them is

2215
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,719
f70 and maybe ai technologies

2216
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,719
so the apn attribute can be derived

2217
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,880
by using those um already published

2218
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,639
match items in mdf-70

2219
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,600
as well as for example the access for

2220
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,320
port

2221
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:13,440
in the access in the edge device

2222
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:17,840
and to and then identify the user group

2223
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,960
and then why uh how how the apin

2224
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:21,600
attribute

2225
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,040
is used in the network and i already

2226
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:26,000
presented

2227
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,199
here very quickly so this attribute

2228
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:32,080
is carried in the data package header

2229
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:32,400
and

2230
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,960
it can be used in the various places

2231
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,920
along the path

2232
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,239
for example at the head end may point

2233
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:40,400
and service functions

2234
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,839
next please

2235
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,880
so still we have some questions and we

2236
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,679
already

2237
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:53,360
uh discussed with art and the secondary

2238
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,400
people and here

2239
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,840
we would like to um so

2240
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,800
discuss here and uh one is about

2241
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,000
security issues

2242
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,520
which has always been challenged

2243
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,800
and to apn and

2244
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,520
so what are the security issues when the

2245
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:16,320
apn attribute is used within the limited

2246
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,199
domain

2247
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:20,800
so whether there are still some

2248
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:24,080
security issues if there are how we can

2249
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,960
meditate

2250
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,520
mitigate them and then it's about

2251
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,400
privacy

2252
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:33,199
another um question which are always

2253
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:36,239
being challenged so we got some

2254
01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:38,560
suggestions from the

2255
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,760
some draft published in the

2256
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:45,440
interior and we could mitigate this

2257
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,480
issue by grouping the users applications

2258
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,719
that is using user group applications

2259
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:52,080
group actually

2260
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,360
it has been there and we just we

2261
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:59,360
wasn't it's explicitly indicate

2262
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,400
and so it's generalized

2263
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,840
this attribute ap attribute is

2264
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,000
generalized

2265
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
and also we can use opaque value

2266
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,280
and it's just a bit string the network

2267
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,880
doesn't need to know who you

2268
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,119
are and what you are doing when what

2269
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:18,719
application is

2270
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:21,440
sending traffic it's not helpful it's

2271
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:22,400
not helpful

2272
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,199
or it's not useful for the network to do

2273
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:26,080
the perform

2274
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:31,199
performance to do the policy enforcement

2275
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,800
so and we should focus on describing

2276
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,280
the classes of policy to be applied to

2277
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,320
the traffic

2278
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:42,400
so i will pause here and so we can

2279
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:49,839
start discussions thank you

2280
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,280
oh yes go ahead uh linda

2281
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:03,360
is a very good uh presentation result

2282
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,440
many of the uh questions um i had before

2283
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,840
um so just one add one more comment to

2284
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:10,960
the

2285
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,960
mdf sd1 project in there there's a

2286
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:15,520
section

2287
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:18,400
on the application segmentation

2288
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,880
application based segmentation

2289
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,639
they have a use case of like retail

2290
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,280
payment system like that payment system

2291
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,000
can only

2292
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:31,040
be mapped into certain topology virtual

2293
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,480
topology versus

2294
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:36,080
other application can be mapped to other

2295
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,639
topologies i think that would be very

2296
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:39,679
useful to use

2297
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:43,199
apn concept

2298
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:45,840
okay good so if you like you could post

2299
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,239
this

2300
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:49,440
information in the ap mailing list and

2301
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:51,520
uh okay

2302
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,840
thank you

2303
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,639
hi shipping at excellent presentation

2304
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,800
thank you so much for clearly explaining

2305
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,080
a lot of things actually we've been

2306
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,360
looking into it

2307
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,239
uh so the first thing i like things can

2308
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,400
you hear me okay

2309
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,679
yeah i can hear you okay okay so the

2310
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:13,840
first thing is uh you clearly separated

2311
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,360
uh it's not from

2312
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,440
end host it's not from application so

2313
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,800
that's very clear

2314
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,199
uh and that's a good progress actually

2315
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:23,119
so it's from the edge devices right so

2316
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:23,679
that's a

2317
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:27,119
that's the scope so my question is um

2318
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:30,719
uh so this is uh

2319
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,520
my understanding as far as i see this is

2320
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,520
for any data plane right it's not for

2321
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,360
ipv6 only

2322
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:40,080
which could have been done with gsr v6

2323
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,719
or srv6 extension header isn't it

2324
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:45,679
or yes is it only for ipv6 it's for any

2325
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:47,199
data plane

2326
01:39:47,199 --> 01:39:51,679
yeah yes finally sd card

2327
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:54,800
okay okay okay so uh the other comment

2328
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,199
is

2329
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,679
you talked about the qoa issues uh in

2330
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,600
the one of the slides use cases

2331
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,480
so the two use cases obviously the whole

2332
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:03,679
multiple working groups have been

2333
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:05,119
discussing is slicing

2334
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:07,040
for sure uh that's one of the holy

2335
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,719
grails like you know you want to

2336
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,480
have provide some determinism and you

2337
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,119
know kind of some slash into the

2338
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:16,400
uh a single domain network and also on

2339
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:17,040
the

2340
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,480
uh on the specifically for 5g in the

2341
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:23,840
single domain and also on the uh

2342
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,520
once it reaches the code you need to

2343
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,199
have the service chaining

2344
01:40:27,199 --> 01:40:29,840
uh requirements so uh so you are you

2345
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,679
targeting this specifically or

2346
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:33,520
you're not touching the slicing topic

2347
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:35,199
but generally in general

2348
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:39,199
overarching cure issues you are talking

2349
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:43,600
and actually we don't um

2350
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,679
we are not uh it's a general

2351
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:51,119
solution out mechanisms

2352
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,080
and a network slicing could be

2353
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,840
integrated with apn

2354
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,800
and using the ping attribute so the

2355
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,159
mission critical

2356
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:02,880
traffic could be steering to the

2357
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,080
dedicated network

2358
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,280
slice that could be one of the use cases

2359
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:11,040
of apn and and then for the sfc i

2360
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,920
mentioned

2361
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,159
what the benefits apn could achieve

2362
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,480
okay and the last question is if it is

2363
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,800
if it were to be done in ipv6 uh

2364
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,679
is it srv6 or the new hobbyhop extension

2365
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,080
header

2366
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:30,080
uh you mean srv6 and

2367
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,880
if the apn uh apn the extension header

2368
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:33,600
has to be

2369
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,800
uh done in with us ipv6 data plane uh

2370
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,320
so you said that it is generic it's

2371
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,000
applied to any data plane but you

2372
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,199
if it were to be done in ipv6

2373
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:47,679
um i saw the gsr v6 uh hackathon

2374
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,880
so the idea is with srv6 or uh you are

2375
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,480
you guys are thinking of proposing a new

2376
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:53,679
extension header

2377
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:57,360
like hobbyhop ah okay i see

2378
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,840
so the apn uh if the data plane is ipv6

2379
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,880
and uh we could use the harper hub

2380
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,119
options header destination options

2381
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:08,800
header and srh

2382
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,840
within srh we could use the the

2383
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:12,560
arguments

2384
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:16,159
of each state and also

2385
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:19,199
the srhtrv and

2386
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:22,560
those places could be used

2387
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,600
to encapsulate this information

2388
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,199
and um it doesn't

2389
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,600
have to be related with the new hubba

2390
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,440
hub options header this is what you

2391
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,719
mentioned right

2392
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,920
so no it's um that was uh

2393
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,840
uh not related with uh the work here

2394
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,800
okay okay thanks actually yeah again

2395
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,040
good presentation thank you

2396
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,960
thank you and maybe just one more uh

2397
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:53,600
clarification so

2398
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,320
the work we are doing on the harper hub

2399
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,199
and mainly

2400
01:42:57,199 --> 01:43:00,480
we the purpose of us is we want to

2401
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:04,320
make the hub hub really usable for the

2402
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,719
operators for the network because this

2403
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,400
really carries a lot of

2404
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,239
very key features and new services

2405
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:15,520
and as we can see so that is the our

2406
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,080
main

2407
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,600
purpose and after the

2408
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,679
presentation in the v6 ops we can see

2409
01:43:23,679 --> 01:43:27,040
it has been agreed by the community

2410
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:30,000
and chairs we could so it's like the

2411
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,639
problem statement has been agreed upon

2412
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:35,360
so thank you so that basically the idea

2413
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,440
is you're coming up with some structure

2414
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,040
which transcends the extension header

2415
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,719
type basically right that's what

2416
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:42,960
uh what it's come down to right so not

2417
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,719
only the extension at the type but also

2418
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:48,960
the data planes okay yeah

2419
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,840
thank you okay thank you

2420
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,840
uh go ahead uh should ben yeah

2421
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:06,800
okay uh hello this is the

2422
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:21,840
thing hello

2423
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:48,719
oh sorry i i muted sorry i i

2424
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:52,239
just uh okay yeah okay thanks so so for

2425
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,239
the last minute or so there was no audio

2426
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:55,040
so

2427
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,000
um okay yeah all right okay start over

2428
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,040
at that point

2429
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,400
okay thank you yeah i guess a brief

2430
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,600
the intro introduction about my uh this

2431
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,960
is the presentation uh

2432
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,840
in today's the psychology session

2433
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:10,719
regarding this

2434
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,880
the uh they are thinking on the social

2435
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,040
media and privacy issue

2436
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,440
i mean so that's the in general i think

2437
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,480
the the people

2438
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,520
in the secularity area and the app

2439
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:25,440
are real uh not understand the

2440
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,960
uh the the user cases uh that always

2441
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:33,119
used uh in the routine area

2442
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,679
the first one they they talked about if

2443
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:36,880
this is the packet

2444
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,920
from this the mobile phone to the uh to

2445
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:40,719
the

2446
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:44,239
uh transport network so

2447
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:47,440
how to uh derive this is the app group

2448
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,440
or the user group information at the

2449
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,800
network edge

2450
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,159
so i uh that's is a is the

2451
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:56,719
answer that's a user this is the simple

2452
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:59,600
way we can according to the five tubes

2453
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,320
to a map to application group and the

2454
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:03,280
user group

2455
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,159
information so that's user can be used

2456
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,760
along with the

2457
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,600
network path the second one they

2458
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,960
don't understand why this package

2459
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,520
uh five tube information can be directly

2460
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:18,480
used

2461
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:22,000
so i told them that the in the transport

2462
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,159
network in the world is a transporter

2463
01:46:24,159 --> 01:46:25,119
network

2464
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:28,880
so this original this is the ip packet

2465
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,520
will be tunneled with the gtp tunnel and

2466
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,239
go on

2467
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:35,280
to with this the srv6 tunnel and the mps

2468
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,159
tunnel

2469
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:38,480
yeah so that's the five tube information

2470
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:40,000
of the original package

2471
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,280
cannot be cannot be caught

2472
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:47,199
in the in the in the transporter network

2473
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,440
or is very hard to be

2474
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:52,639
caught in the transport network so the

2475
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,080
last the questions of the

2476
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,960
uh the question is that why not directly

2477
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,520
copy the original the fab tube

2478
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,239
uh information from this the original

2479
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,880
package to the tunnel encapsulation

2480
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,360
uh so i think that i my this is the

2481
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:08,320
question that

2482
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,159
we know that they use the 5-2

2483
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:12,480
information so they can call this

2484
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:15,440
the performance for uh called the uh

2485
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,719
forwarding performance

2486
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:19,360
issue and also that's the because you

2487
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,040
know that's the

2488
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,520
match this is the fab tube needs the

2489
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,239
complex

2490
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,880
the flexible complex the forwarding

2491
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,000
algorithm

2492
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,360
so that's the entry of this the

2493
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:35,280
entry of this the scalability

2494
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,000
is also so we will encounter the

2495
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:38,880
scalability

2496
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,520
issue so that means that we cannot

2497
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,000
achieve

2498
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,440
the uh many uh entries for this

2499
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:48,400
the severe traffic or some of these the

2500
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,320
other secularity process

2501
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,320
based on this the application group or

2502
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,760
the user group

2503
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,679
so that's that's the additional

2504
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:56,880
information

2505
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,320
so according to this introduction so we

2506
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,400
can say that

2507
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:06,159
some you know some of this scenario is

2508
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:08,239
easy to be understand in the routine

2509
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:09,280
area but

2510
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:13,360
this is harder to be understand in the

2511
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,560
in the application area and the circular

2512
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,360
area because they always assume that the

2513
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:20,159
package

2514
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:22,960
transverse the internet so that's the

2515
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:23,920
user

2516
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,719
my introduction so i i think that's okay

2517
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:27,360
because

2518
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:30,480
this the introduction will be helpful uh

2519
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,000
to the course area discussion and

2520
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,480
understanding each other okay that's all

2521
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,840
okay

2522
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,199
uh yeah so uh i guess count kasich if

2523
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:54,480
you have a question

2524
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,719
um and is it but is it a question for

2525
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,320
shuping

2526
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:02,239
it would be good if uh shuping could

2527
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:05,360
uh unmute again i think

2528
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:08,800
okay good uh so go ahead

2529
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,280
kassick

2530
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:16,159
you need to unmute yourself

2531
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:28,400
uh so i'm seeing kalsick in the queue

2532
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,880
however

2533
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,719
um up i guess khalsa

2534
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:38,639
says he is having uh trouble unmuting

2535
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:42,159
um okay well we'll

2536
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:44,638
we have

2537
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:51,280
okay um you want to type your question

2538
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,840
i think type it we will read it load

2539
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,840
yeah

2540
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:11,679
so shall i continue because i still have

2541
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:13,199
a few slides

2542
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:16,400
left over um

2543
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,239
okay so why why don't you continue and

2544
01:50:18,239 --> 01:50:19,840
then we'll pick up cal six

2545
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,560
kalsick is typing a question uh well

2546
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,199
actually so

2547
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:24,639
he's finished typing the question so he

2548
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:27,440
says i'm wondering how apn header would

2549
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,840
be integrated with mpls

2550
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,760
or ipv4 data plane

2551
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:38,159
that is related with the solution

2552
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:41,679
and we can do it

2553
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:47,519
i mean later this is the solution

2554
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:52,320
related

2555
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,599
so we can investigate it all together

2556
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:57,920
later

2557
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:01,920
okay okay but that's sort of within

2558
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:04,000
scope i guess that that's a possibility

2559
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,480
you're not excluding that possibility

2560
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,599
i guess yeah yeah chris

2561
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:13,199
i can add some the point

2562
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,800
i cannot hear you oh okay feel free feel

2563
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,480
free to

2564
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:24,080
to answer that a bit okay uh i i wanted

2565
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,280
to add uh

2566
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:28,560
uh the point is that the for the i'm

2567
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,280
sure

2568
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,560
domain because we have this the header

2569
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:32,960
maybe

2570
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:35,920
we can use some the uh in fact this i

2571
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:38,000
think this is a good question and also

2572
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,400
you know that's in the on the friday

2573
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:41,599
there's also the john

2574
01:51:41,599 --> 01:51:43,520
the meeting to discuss the i'm sure

2575
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:44,639
encapsulation

2576
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:46,719
i think this is also related with that

2577
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:47,760
one and

2578
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:50,000
now i think that this is the possibly we

2579
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,159
you can use some of the special purpose

2580
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:52,800
label

2581
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,199
to indicate some of this the extension

2582
01:51:55,199 --> 01:51:56,159
information

2583
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:59,840
uh below the uh i'm sure the label stack

2584
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,400
so that we can achieve this the

2585
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:03,199
application

2586
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:06,560
information uh uh from this the

2587
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:09,199
from this the extension header that's

2588
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:11,119
below the label stack

2589
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:14,719
and that's a possible way yeah

2590
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,480
okay uh thanks so so at this point

2591
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,920
shooping why don't you go ahead and

2592
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,239
finish your your slides because

2593
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:24,320

2594
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,920
