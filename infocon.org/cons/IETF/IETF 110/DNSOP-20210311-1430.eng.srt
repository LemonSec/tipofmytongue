110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,320
dropped off the face of the earth for a

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
little bit and he seems to hold the pen

112
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,800
and so we're trying to actually track

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
down what to do there

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,000

123
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,560
that seems to be um as i sort of stated

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
earlier this week service b is a new

125
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
text records for the 21st century

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,360
um they're they're we've been they've

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:07,759
been

128
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,120
doing lots of work and there's a couple

129
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,320
things they've done recently they've

130
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
sort of they want to change the

131
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
parameter registry to first come first

132
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,440
serve

133
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
ben had a good talk with diana about

134
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,720
that um

135
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
we've been awaiting we've been sort of

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,840
watching because the

137
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,440
the ech work going on in tls

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
it's kind of they're going to be

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,720
tracking each one

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,479
um each document so they'll probably end

141
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,000
up getting batched up as they go through

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
the editor queue

143
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
um there's been a small change on

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,320
changing echo to fig to ech

145
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,080
and there's some discussion on code

146
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
points and testing that we're going to

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
sort of settle out but we do think we're

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,680
ready for working group last call

149
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,240
um but if anybody wants to speak up and

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,199
say we're

151
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,280
you know we're wrong then please you

152
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,880

153

155
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,919
playing with the slides

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,199

there's um i did a short write-up from

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,000
the

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,000
go

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,160

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,759
label the empty non-terminal issue

165
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,080
resolved in the latest draft

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,639
there's a blue workaround described and

167
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,080
if there's a better solution they really

168
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,479
want to hear from folks

169
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,880
we do feel all the protocol technical

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,479
issues have been raised

171
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
if there's others we know this is a

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,560
controversial one

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
and i'm sure people are sort of going to

174
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000
push back on some of this so

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,520
we're i'm waiting to see

176
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,039
what gets sort of said along the way

177
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
here and you know is this ready to move

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:45,840
forward

179
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,039
are we going to move forward with it are

180
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,400
people just going to be like no this is

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,599
just you know

182
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,479
so we i know this is sort of this is one

183
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
of the more controversial ones so

184
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
but i think a lot of stuff's been

185
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,919
addressed

186
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,280
so we welcome to hear from folks

187
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,430
so jump to the next one um

188
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,319
[Music]

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,240
we do we've got a couple of things that

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
are really working for working group

191
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,680
last call tcp requirements

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,599
it's been sitting there and um it

193
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,039
it's more been sort of a timing thing

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,720
with vote with some of the chairs

195
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
um i do think dns revalidation that's

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,039
been

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,800
recently updated i think it's very close

198
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
if not it's ready already

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
um the 5933 biz is really working

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,120
sort of waiting on this sort of ionic

201
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
consideration discussion

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,599
um and that that paul's going to have

203
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,039
later because i think paul did show up

204
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,120
he said he may not so i appreciate

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,680
glad to see that he's made it and 84.99

206
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
biz there hasn't been much discussion

207
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,560
and i'd like to sort of figure that out

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,039
and

209
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,240
i'm going to have to spend a little bit

210
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,800
of time trying to work forward on that

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
we'd like to sort of see that sort of

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
you know are we really going to do this

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,720
or not so it's not a big bunch of

214
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,080
changes but i think we should just sort

215
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,639
of

216
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,800
do it and get it done and moving on so

217
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,840
next one mr benno

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,039
a couple of these documents have expired

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
and we've been trying to track the

220
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,400
authors down

221
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,440
um i i think um daniel's gonna update

222
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,879
validated requirements

223
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,319
we do you know we i think the working

224
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:20,800
group

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
needs to figure out are we gonna move

226
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,400
forward with these are there worth

227
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,440
discussions

228
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,879
you know are we just gonna let them

229
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
expire um

230
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
we should just not let them expire

231
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,000
quietly we should really sort of

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
make a decision you know even if no

233
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,440
decision is the right decision

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,799
we should at least state that so that's

235
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,679
kind of my feeling on that one so thanks

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,519
let's go on to the next one

237
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
there's not too many left oh yeah we i

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,160
have nothing to say on this right now

239
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
um i usually don't i try to be quiet

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
about this um

241
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,040
thanks panel and this one we were gonna

242
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
basically try to put out a call for

243
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
adoption for a few months ago and i

244
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,959
think it got

245
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,480
lost in the shuffle after the last

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
meeting around the holidays

247
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,240
all right so i think this will be

248
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,080
revisited and probably moved out

249
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,200
um we'll probably do that so

250
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
uh next one i think that's really our

251
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,680
main things are working on

252
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
on uh working days from the march 1st of

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,480
march

340
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,839
till the 5th of march

341
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,839
and but that turns out to be a

342
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
short hackathon but you will learn more

343
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,120
about it

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,959
in this presentation so

345
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,680
in the beginning of february our last in

346
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
the previous

347
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,079
hackathon at the itf 109

348
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
i we used the dns orgs metamouse

349
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,279
to talk between the participants of the

350
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,800
hackathon

351
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,160
and which is

352
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,040
by the way open for everybody i have a

353
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,880
link on the

354
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,279
hackathon wiki page where you can

355
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,720
subscribe to this

356
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,639
chat service but all the dns developers

357
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,360
are

358
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,000
already there so it's sort of convenient

359
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,279
place to

360
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,600
talk amongst each other and

361
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,920
i renamed the channel name from

362
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,839
hackathon 109 to

363
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
hector 110 and then some people began

364
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,079
sort of complaining uh it's a pity that

365
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,040
we cannot have

366
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,639
in-person hackathon and because like

367
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,519
hobby shedded or better from dyke you

368
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:53,839
know

369
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,079
hackathon week will see me doing three

370
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,760
small 15 minutes

371
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
things over that week with a hackathon

372
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
weekend in person hackathon

373
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,720
you either do a lot of stuff or

374
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
absolutely nothing because you're only

375
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
chatting

376
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,480
so i proposed to organize

377
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,519
a hackathon in-person hackathon

378
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
day week saturday at the enormous

379
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
lobster office there are quite a few

380
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
dutch dns developers and i invited them

381
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
all over

382
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,839
but none of them dared except for

383
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,480
matthijs no

384
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,240
i i said we will keep distance and i'll

385
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,800
do the winners open and everything that

386
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
yeah so matthias came

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,920
saturday the 6th of march which was

388
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,120
really nice

389
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,199
so here's my ties entering

390
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,639
on the 6th of march march

391
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,240
so before the hackathon started there

392
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
were quite some ideas

393
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
from dns developers that i wanted to

394
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,680
work on

395
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,320
like dns over quick and we wanted to

396
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,399
work on the new catalog zone stuff

397
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,760
which will be talked about later

398
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,120
but yeah dns like like i showed you

399
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,279
before dns developers really have to

400
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,079
work

401
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,279
during the week and they have

402
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
little spare time so most of that didn't

403
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,760
happen

404
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,959
uh though there was also a

405
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,760
plan to work on salt and that's not the

406
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,279
sentient species

407
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,480
that's on wikipedia the wikipedia in the

408
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,320
star wars universe but

409
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,240
zone transfers over tls

410
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,600
and yeah a part of

411
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
zone transfers are also the extended dns

412
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,240
errors so we worked on that too

413
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,320
and sarah dickinson she put together

414
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,800
this

415
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,240
excellent hackathon planning documents

416
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
on google docs and unfortunately

417
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,920
sarah herself she didn't feel so well

418
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,680
at the beginning of the hackathon week

419
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,639
so she hasn't actually participated

420
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,040
during the week but there was a

421
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,920
the people listed on the slide she found

422
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
pallavi and han

423
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,160
they had a small group working from the

424
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
united states and

425
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
we had a new developer at elnett laps

426
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,959
tom

427
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
carpe who worked on the extended dns

428
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,880
errors

429
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,000
vouter he reviewed all chiffon ballast

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,759
enhance

431
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,360
commits and pedophile diagrams making

432
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,839
worked

433
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,360
on results for paradigmas

434
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
and for bind oh

435
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,680
because we also wanted to do

436
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,240
interoperability testing and for this i

437
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,839
registered the domain name zotrox

438
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,959
and span up a few virtual machines

439
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,920
to do interoperability testing and play

440
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
with name servers and

441
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,880
salt basically so

442
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,959
what got done well tom coppay he

443
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,039
worked on extended dns errors in

444
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,559
nsd and he found for example

445
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,880
when going over all the air dns error or

446
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,079
error codes in nsd that some

447
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,960
could use a extra

448
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,480
code point for as a

449
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,919
extended dns error for example uh when

450
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,600
a dname expansion becomes too large

451
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,960
right so uh there's this it

452
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
returns for our code yx domain which

453
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,240
means

454
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,799
some name that ought not to access does

455
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,679
exist

456
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,919
that doesn't say that much now this

457
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,039
combination of d

458
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,000
name in yx domain might tell you that

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
it's

460
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,320
expansion became too large but we also

461
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,760
noticed that

462
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,840
other name servers return surf fill

463
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,120
so maybe a ede code for this would be

464
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,600
nice

465
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,679
so we did now with other

466
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
pallavi and han worked on access

467
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,880
controls to provide sounds results only

468
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
of course if you provide sounds over tls

469
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,840
you do not want them to leak over other

470
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,919
transports

471
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,120
so this is what the access control

472
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,320
list entry looks like in nsd

473
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,320
and also if you make access control to

474
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,240
provide sounds

475
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,799
for the whole internet without a t-sec

476
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
key as configured

477
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,280
in the above pane then nsd will

478
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,160
warn you or error actually that this is

479
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,600
not allowed because

480
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,160
if you're offering over tls you do not

481
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
want other ones to see your sound

482
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
content and if you're offering it to

483
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
everybody without authentication then

484
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:05,919
that's

485
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,960
probably not what you're meant to do so

486
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,280
i

487
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,400
tricked for testing purposes uh

488
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,320
nsd into surfing a zone to everyone

489
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,080
this old roxanne by splitting

490
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,200
the whole internet in two and

491
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,320
providing four access control list

492
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,919
entries and for ipv4 and ipv6 space

493
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,559
so in the below page you see that it

494
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,679
works

495
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,840
with k dig you can do queries over tls

496
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,039
and also

497
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,520
a transport over tls already

498
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,799
so i also worked for

499
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
access control for queries this is

500
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,400
obvious in many name servers but nsd

501
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,080
didn't have it yet

502
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,960
but it's also part of the draft that you

503
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
may not want to

504
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,600
allow queries on zones which are offered

505
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,360
a result

506
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,480
so i

507
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,919
reused the same access control mechanism

508
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,600
and but i'm showing this

509
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,720
this broke the name server i'm showing

510
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,520
you why

511
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
because you know to do a zone transfer

512
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,720
the secondary needs to do a shower query

513
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
first so with this access control i

514
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,640
prevented server queries

515
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,840
and um i'm sharing this because

516
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,960
i think it's um

517
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,679
interesting well maybe show you on the

518
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,159
next

519
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,280
slide bye because

520
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,880
maybe you also do not want to leak

521
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,760
what zones you are serving if you're

522
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,880
offering it over a result

523
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
by query so maybe you want to prevent

524
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,760
server queries so that the nameserver

525
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,360
cannot discover which sounds

526
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,159
are served so this is explicitly not

527
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
part of the vod draft

528
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,919
because there are many parts which

529
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
will leak which zones are served like

530
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,919
a notify for example or the shower query

531
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,080
preceding a transfer

532
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,640
but on the catalog zones we have an

533
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,360
option

534
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
with a talk will follow after this one

535
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:26,799
in which

536
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,440
the serial numbers can be distributed to

537
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,679
the secondaries

538
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,480
via the catalog zones potentially over a

539
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,520
tls

540
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,760
so in that case you do not need to

541
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
notify anymore

542
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,039
and also in the catalog zone

543
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,000
draft that says that you do not have to

544
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
do a shower query first but

545
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,880
can immediately transfer the zone and

546
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
abort if it is not what you expect it to

547
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,799
be

548
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,720
so i think that would be interesting

549
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,039
thing to explore in the future maybe

550
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,520
also interoperability testing between

551
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,320
powerdns

552
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,600
binding nsd this all went very well

553
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,919
here you have me and mathis on the

554
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,640
hackathon

555
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,960
saturday at the inner matlab's office

556
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
creating the the secondary primary

557
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,799
relationships between the different

558
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
pieces of software

559
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
and what did we learn

560
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,240
you know uh

561
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,840
maybe it would be nice to start thinking

562
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,320
about

563
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,679
updating extended dns errors with all

564
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,240
the

565
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
new stuff that we don't have nice codes

566
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:43,840
in

567
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,120
ede if people are implementing that

568
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,880
privacy this is an interesting thing to

569
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
explore where you're not

570
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
revealing what sent you served by

571
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,720
queries either

572
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,360
by combining sort of with catalog zones

573
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,000
or

574
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,120
serial distribution via catalog zones

575
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,559
and extended dns errors and

576
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,480
yeah the conclusion is more or less that

577
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,760
sort just

578
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,679
works so that's

579
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,080
the end of my presentation these were

580
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
other people that

581
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,840
participated in the hackathon

582
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,000
thank you thank you william

583
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,679
it's good to see that the hackathon is

584
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,080
not is not being forgotten

585
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,720
even under our current circumstances and

586
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,080
it'll be nice to have people in the same

587
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,880
room again

588
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,120
someday that would be nice

589
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,200
indeed thank you um

590
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,240
up next unless there are very urgent

591
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,919
questions here

592
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,880
let's check in the

593
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,640
okido not in the not in the chat room

594
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,760
either

595
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,279
um yeah then i like to invite

596
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,720
libra pelan and peter van dyke for the

597
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,840
next presentation

598
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,199
shall i run the slides

599
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,200
yes please yeah of course i'll share my

600
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,120
screen

601
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:32,159
and let's see

602
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,720
this one

603
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,440
yep there they are and full screens

604
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,799
okay so hello there we are yeah yeah

605
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,679
can you hear me well yeah excellent

606
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,159
thank you

607
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,159
there is there is quite much going on

608
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,840
around catalog zones

609
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
and there are things to be discussed so

610
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,200
i'm looking forward for the discussion

611
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,600
section of this presentation

612
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,919
and we prepared just a new version of

613
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:00,960
the draft just

614
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,240
before the iitf meeting deadline

615
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,919
so sorry for that but yeah let me start

616
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,520
with the with the request what catalog

617
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,760
zones are in their history

618
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,840
next slide please

619
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,000
so what catalogs are they are a way

620
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
of configuring an autoretentive dns

621
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
server remotely

622
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,919
so this mostly applies when you have a

623
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,679
primary secondary environment

624
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
and your set of zones is changing

625
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,200
frequently so you like need it for

626
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
synchronizing the set of zones that are

627
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
configured on the secondary with

628
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,559
the primary and it's

629
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,720
done with the use of fake crafted zone

630
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,279
and this is in order for implementation

631
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,080
simplicity because there are already

632
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,039
well-established

633
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,640
xfr xfr techniques for transferring zone

634
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,400
and also for the sake of

635
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,640
interoperability

636
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,520
next slide please

637
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,480
so it all started several years ago with

638
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,880
an

639
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,600
implementation in bind and later a

640
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,640
respective

641
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,240
draft that described the catalog zone

642
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,840
with quite many configuration options

643
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,240
embedded in it but

644
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,760
this was not entirely successful

645
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,400
next slide

646
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,600
so last year we came with a different

647
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
approach that is quite minimalistic

648
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,880
and it means that in the catalog zone

649
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
there is just a list

650
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,679
of the member zone just the list and

651
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,360
nothing more

652
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,559
and no configuration options in there

653
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,760
and we presented this in the last itf

654
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,440
meeting

655
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
and with the message that we are almost

656
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
done that we need only to solve some

657
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,159
nitpicks and we are waiting for further

658
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,919
implementations the first one being

659
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,279
no dns 3.0

660
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,720
next slide so this is how

661
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,559
the new approach looked like it was

662
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
just a zone with the list of member

663
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,520
zones to be configured

664
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,960
and their configuration was all taken

665
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,880
from a configuration template that was

666
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,360
assigned to the catalog

667
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,279
so this work that welded for the

668
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,039
operator that

669
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,159
needs several groups of member zones

670
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,720
with different configuration in each

671
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,320
group

672
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,760
he was expected

673
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
and we actually encouraged him to

674
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,720
operate several catalog zones

675
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,159
where each catalog zone contain the

676
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,320
members with the same configuration for

677
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,640
example the nsx signed and in the

678
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,960
second group unsigned in the strategy

679
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,840
group for example insect3 and so on

680
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
so this works pretty well and we were

681
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,520
happy with that

682
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,480
and also the users which already emerged

683
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,960
very good

684
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,320
but a problem appeared on this problem

685
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,200
was

686
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,559
that once the operator needs to

687
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,799
transfer the member zone from one

688
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,799
catalog to another

689
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,720
he just needs to like remove it from the

690
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
one catalog zone and add it to another

691
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,880
one

692
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
next slide please but uh this

693
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,399
process can be like synchronized when

694
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,320
you modify two different zones

695
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,720
there is no guarantee that the xfl to

696
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
the secondaries

697
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,600
will get synchronized or gets will get

698
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,559
just

699
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,559
at once so this was quite difficult but

700
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,919
william found a solution that was quite

701
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,840
viable it was solution to

702
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,760
transfer the member zone between two

703
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,960
catalogues

704
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,000
safely it was quite difficult

705
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,720
to be implemented but i managed to make

706
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,480
a working prototype

707
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,360
and for the operator it was quite easy

708
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,320
to operate but

709
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,200
not entirely and it took two steps

710
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,640
because it can be done at once so it was

711
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,919
a kind of roll over

712
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,600
and we were expecting to to use this

713
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,399
and to finally solve all the problems of

714
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,600
catalog zones

715
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,880
but please next slide another

716
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,799
requirement emerged

717
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,760
that somehow the catalog zones you are

718
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
removing the member from

719
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,640
shall have control over which in other

720
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
catalog zone is the member transferred

721
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,360
to

722
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,640
uh please wait for the

723
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,080
second half of the presentation for

724
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,720
peter who explains the details about it

725
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,039
but overall next slide please

726
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:52,320
so overall we

727
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,720
we like found that this is no longer

728
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,159
viable and

729
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,000
we resigned on the property of catholic

730
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,320
zone that the catalog zone is just a

731
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,399
list of members

732
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,600
and we defined the properties of

733
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,159
each member within the catalog zone that

734
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,200
the member can optionally have

735
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
so there are so far three properties i

736
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,640
hope

737
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
they will remain very little of them and

738
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,720
because

739
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,320
in order to maintain the simplicity of

740
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,159
catalog zones

741
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,120
and please next slide

742
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,760
so in the end it will look like this we

743
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,600
have a ptr record defining

744
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,720
a member zone within a catalog and

745
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,760
several additional records are

746
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,960
respective to the member which define

747
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,080
in which configuration group it is and

748
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,090
some other

749
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,799
[Music]

750
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,960
some other properties of the member next

751
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
slide please

752
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,640
so let me start with the configuration

753
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,919
group

754
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,080
it's a solution for the operators that

755
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,360
need several configuration group

756
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,519
like groups of differently configured

757
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,799
members

758
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,080
they are no longer encouraged to operate

759
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,880
several catalog zones although they

760
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,480
still can

761
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,600
but they are encouraged to define

762
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,240
several configuration groups within one

763
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,519
catalog zone

764
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,960
and this way they can very easily

765
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,559
switch a member zone between two

766
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,880
configuration groups because it all

767
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,080
happens within one

768
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,000
catalog zone and the resulting change

769
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,919
of the catalog zone will be easily

770
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,240
transferred at once to

771
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,360
all the secondaries

772
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,279
yeah so next slide and peter please

773
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,390
continue yes thank you

774
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,600
[Music]

775
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,000
so as liber mentioned we have three zone

776
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
properties defined right now besides

777
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,679
the member's own name of course and as

778
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,279
william also mentioned in the

779
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,880
exotic just now there is a desire for

780
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,559
several reasons

781
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,039
to signal serial changes more

782
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,960
efficiently

783
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,880
by putting the serial property in the

784
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,399
catalog zone which is an

785
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,039
optional thing to do and i imagine not

786
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,880
all implementations might do it not

787
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
operates might want it

788
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
however this allows operators that do

789
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,159
want this to avoid a lot of soa queries

790
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,399
to avoid having to worry about missed

791
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,559
notifies because of packet loss

792
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,559
or secondaries being down for a while

793
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,519
because network changes or whatever

794
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,559
this also allows a primary to decide

795
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,720
when to do a big bush because he might

796
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,760
have capacity

797
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,799
to serve all those zone transfers

798
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,760
in this example the serial is encoded in

799
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,960
a c-sync

800
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,679
resource record but this is open to

801
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,399
discussion right now

802
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,840
next slide please

803
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,559
as liber mentioned the previous

804
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,360
implement

805
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,960
their implementation c setting

806
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,200
implementation used multiple catalog

807
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,279
zones to map to multiple configuration

808
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,399
templates

809
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,200
which is not something that might be

810
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,559
appropriate for all

811
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,919
setups beyond that we found that some

812
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,399
operators might be running catalog zones

813
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,320
from multiple users multiple operators

814
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
which means that if you remove a zone

815
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,679
from one catalog

816
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,360
you do not want that zone to pop up

817
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
randomly in some other

818
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,600
users catalog that that list has listed

819
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,720
that zone

820
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,200
that would basically be hijacking as a

821
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,120
service

822
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,519
so instead of that uh a poweriness

823
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,840
contributor called case monsauer

824
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,559
proposed a change of ownership property

825
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,000
where the

826
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,880
catalog zone that is about to remove a

827
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,240
member zone

828
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,880
can tell the secondary i want this

829
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,679
member zone to go to this specific

830
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,760
other catalog then

831
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,799
when the other catalog has accepted the

832
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,840
member zone

833
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,519
the change of ownership property can be

834
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,279
removed from the first zone

835
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
and everything happens in a predictable

836
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,320
way

837
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,119
next slide please

838
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,079
this brings us to our last slide with a

839
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,480
few open questions

840
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,639
some people have requested that unique

841
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,679
id

842
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,040
for a zombie predictable

843
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,879
so that it is possible to do queries

844
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,040
into catalog zones so that given a

845
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,239
member zone name

846
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,000
you can find the properties without

847
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,480
listing the whole zone

848
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,159
the use cases for that have not been

849
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,239
described in our draft yet

850
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,040
the second question is as i mentioned

851
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,679
that the signaling of serial numbers

852
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,040
right now uses c sync in the example uh

853
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,760
which seems quite appropriate because it

854
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,359
has the serial number and a couple of

855
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,320
flag fields that we might put a good use

856
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,839
other people have suggested we should

857
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,599
just use txt

858
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,599
which might be okay because it does live

859
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,440
at the same separate

860
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,800
uh name label under the

861
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,920
unique id and also these zones

862
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
are not for querying if we ignore the

863
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,720
first question here

864
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,119
a previous version of the draft also

865
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,160
suggested

866
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
defining a new serial type holding just

867
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,480
32 bits of a number

868
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,640
and finally we would really like to hear

869
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,000
from operators

870
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,079
whether the draft in the current form

871
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,680
even though it's a bit messy

872
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,640
seems viable and covers their primary

873
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,359
needs

874
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,759
thank you

875
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,839
thank you liber and peter

876
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,720
yeah the floor is open uh alexander

877
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,959
please

878
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,800
hello everybody um peter lieber thanks

879
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,599
thanks for

880
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,800
uh creating that new version and uh

881
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,520
i i talked to our operators team before

882
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:01,839
and

883
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,280
and they said it's absolutely a

884
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,040
requirement that they can see

885
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,960
the the serial number of the zone the

886
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,800
catalogue zone because otherwise as you

887
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
as you very well know

888
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,720
um we need to bombard the primary name

889
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,800
servers we saw our queries all the time

890
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
and that's very frustrating so one of

891
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,800
the

892
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,599
main use cases for us would be to have

893
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,520
essentially a catalog of

894
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,119
serial numbers so that's much

895
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,640
appreciated

896
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,760
no matter what form it takes uh um we

897
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,839
don't really mind if it's messy or not i

898
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,760
mean from the operational perspective of

899
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,320
course

900
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,839
but as long as the serial number is

901
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,799
there it's good

902
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
right yeah the plan is for the draft of

903
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,560
course to be not messy in the end

904
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,800
as well and you do make a good point

905
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,119
some people do not need catalog zones

906
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,040
to tell their secondaries what domains

907
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,320
they have

908
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,920
but some people do have a serial

909
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,520
signaling problem and

910
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,320
i feel that the intention is that we can

911
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,000
solve that too

912
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,520
thanks okay thank you

913
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,640
uh ray ray bellas please go ahead

914
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,160
hi can you hear me yes yes so um yeah

915
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,839
i'm concerned about the serial signaling

916
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,320
actually

917
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,720
um i think there's far too little

918
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,160
discussion either on the list or in the

919
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,040
draft about

920
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,440
how these serial numbers will be kept up

921
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,400
to date

922
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,920
because it kind of either implies that

923
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,320
the catalog zone itself on the primary

924
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,119
server

925
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,160
has to either be synthetic and generate

926
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,720
those

927
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,240
values on the fly based on the other

928
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,400
zones that are present or to have

929
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,720
some other active band process

930
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,480
automatically update the catalog zone

931
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,359
using dns update

932
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,640
um i mean i mean if the feature is

933
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,000
optional that's one thing but if it's

934
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,800
going to be kind of mandatory then

935
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,160
yeah that has massive effects for how

936
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,599
people actually use catalog zones in

937
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,040
production would actually maintain that

938
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,839
zone

939
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,160
so i know the power dns implementation

940
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
is in fact completely synthetic

941
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,720
in which case this is very easy for us

942
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,920
but it

943
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,920
might make total sense for other people

944
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,400
to generate these zones via ns update or

945
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,320
just as text files

946
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,160
and for them it would indeed be harder

947
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,960
to keep the serials updated depending on

948
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,480
their total scale number of zones etc so

949
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,880
i do feel we need to keep this property

950
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,839
optional

951
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,680
so that implementations can decide if

952
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,040
it's easy for them

953
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,200
or easier hard for them depending on the

954
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,800
mode of operation

955
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,880
and of course operators can then make

956
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,400
their choices

957
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,240
in how they operate their surface what

958
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,560
software they choose

959
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,040
yeah definitely argument as far as i can

960
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,000
tell

961
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,520
yeah i mean that's good i mean we are

962
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,760
actually using catalogues in production

963
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,880
um at ifc for um our uh

964
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,359
lots of other domain names uh not our

965
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,640
core domain name

966
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,599
and um yeah it would it would require a

967
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,119
change in process if the

968
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,200
serial stuff became mandatory

969
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,040
then i don't think we should do that

970
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,240
thank you yeah okay

971
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,320
any other issues questions points

972
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,440
you want to share or to bring up to the

973
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,000
microphone

974
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,839
so um

975
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,720
what so um to the author so you did

976
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,880
talk oh sorry liber please go ahead

977
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,280
before i start summarizing

978
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,200
yeah i'm i'm quite disappointed that

979
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,240
this didn't lead to bigger discussion

980
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,680
because

981
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,040
this like new proposal is is quite

982
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,760
quite new it's baked just before this

983
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,520
idf deadline and

984
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,839
we were expecting uh much more like

985
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,520
uh discussion around uh either

986
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,400
approval of this new approach or or

987
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,440
denial or something like that

988
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,520
yeah besides my my personal

989
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,119
like if my personal feel fear

990
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,319
around the serial property is that uh

991
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,480
the catalog zone will be updated very

992
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,520
frequently and

993
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,400
in the operators which i guess is the

994
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,280
usual

995
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,920
usual use case for catholic zones which

996
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,720
have

997
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,800
very many member zones it might lead to

998
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,160
like the huge catalog zone

999
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,280
is updated frequently and this

1000
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,160
other properties that do not really work

1001
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,200
together if you have a big zone and

1002
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,359
you you operate it frequently but this

1003
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,599
is this is just my perspective i'm not

1004
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,440
an operator i'm just the software router

1005
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,160
so

1006
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,319
i would be i would be willing to hear

1007
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,599
more about this

1008
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,079
thank you

1009
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,560
alexander please go ahead

1010
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,040
you're muted

1011
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,040
i like that last remark

1012
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,079
hi we're here lit between the mostly

1013
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,079
static and mostly dynamic parts has come

1014
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,359
up in discussion

1015
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,200
but i don't think the draft currently

1016
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,400
mentions it

1017
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,119
i do think it would not be a big change

1018
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,000
to any part of the protocol

1019
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,760
i guess it would actually come down to

1020
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,119
implementation decisions

1021
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,280
okay yeah okay thank you

1022
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,400
uh ray please go ahead and i close the

1023
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,119
queue

1024
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,079
beta yes so on this question of the

1025
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,839
serial signaling whether that be text t

1026
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:52,240
or c

1027
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,960
sync or something else um i'd like to

1028
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,400
reiterate what i said on the list a few

1029
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,760
weeks ago that i don't think it should

1030
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,280
be c-sync

1031
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,119
as a previous pen holder on previous

1032
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,480
versions of this draft

1033
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,960
i did go to some length to avoid

1034
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,560
semantic abuse of existing rr types

1035
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,960
c-sync is defined for being child sorry

1036
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,800
to child sibling or vice versa

1037
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,040
sorry transparency this is not child's

1038
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,760
parent it's primary to secondary

1039
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,599
and yes it happens to have the right

1040
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:23,200
fields but it's a semantic abuse

1041
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,920
that said a new type is not necessarily

1042
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,520
the right answer because then we've got

1043
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,119
to define

1044
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,200
an rr type which is only essentially

1045
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,720
different interviews within catalog

1046
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,280
zones

1047
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,720
um which is not a problem in terms of

1048
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,319
the allocations and

1049
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,839
the number of rr types that are

1050
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,560
available but it might have implications

1051
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,920
here should it be recorded as a meta

1052
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,359
type for example or indeed

1053
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,400
there are new type of types so i don't

1054
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,359
know what the right answer is but i

1055
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,560
don't think the c-sync is it

1056
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,520
thank you uh peter go please go ahead

1057
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,520
or is there a reply by one of the

1058
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,000
authors

1059
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,119
hi the next speaker in the queue is the

1060
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,800
peter that proposed ceasing so i'll

1061
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,680
just let him talk okay excellent peter

1062
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,119
please go ahead

1063
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,960
yeah although um yeah so the comments i

1064
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,240
wanted to make are not specifically on

1065
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,760
how the cereal

1066
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,480
um on how to signal the cereals i um

1067
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,160
proposed the c-sync thing because it

1068
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,000
contained the field for

1069
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,599
cereal and i don't think it would be

1070
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,119
such a semantic abuse but i don't have

1071
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,119
any eggs in that

1072
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:28,240
so um i raised my hand here to comment

1073
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,079
on something else which was the

1074
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,079
catalog zone size and the frequent

1075
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,839
changes if you include properties like

1076
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,880
serial and um yeah it's true that

1077
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,119
the the catalog zones can become pretty

1078
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,240
large

1079
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,880
but i think there may be other ways

1080
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,119
around that

1081
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,280
that are different from just avoiding

1082
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,359
the large size for example you could

1083
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,000
um do an ix r instead of an ax fr which

1084
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,440
of course not all

1085
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,760
server software supports but um so that

1086
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,960
might be something to be considered

1087
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,720
because if you do an ixfr between two

1088
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,240
catalog zone versions then

1089
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,319
the diff you get essentially tells you

1090
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,280
the recipe

1091
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,440
what to change in the secondary which

1092
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,040
zones to add to remove and for which

1093
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
once the serial has changed so that's

1094
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,920
pretty much a minimal set of what you

1095
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,920
would want to know in such a case

1096
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
and also um so that is from the

1097
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,880
conceptual side not from the

1098
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,839
implementation side of course

1099
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,359
implementation for that

1100
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,160
is also significant work and all um and

1101
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,040
second

1102
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,400
one could do sharding um like

1103
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,280
for ip reverse zones which are usually

1104
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,359
not all in one zone but

1105
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,800
there are sub zones depending on the

1106
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,400
graphics one could do a similar thing

1107
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,280
for catalog zones so for example if the

1108
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,920
unique id

1109
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,160
that's listed here at the top bullet

1110
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,040
would be

1111
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,480
some sort of hash of the member

1112
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,280
zone name then you could for example um

1113
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,119
split up the catalog zone

1114
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:53,760
in 16 sub catalog zones for example by

1115
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,520
the last or first digit of that hash

1116
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,359
i'm not saying that should be done but

1117
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,880
i'm saying that

1118
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,359
if you do such sharding then the size

1119
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,599
sort of reduces exponentially and the

1120
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,200
the update frequency also may reduce

1121
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,280
significantly um

1122
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,560
or you might find some other sort of

1123
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,480
grouping for frequently and

1124
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,760
non-frequently changing stuff for

1125
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,119
example so i think there are solutions

1126
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,040
around that

1127
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,960
um yeah and somebody has said that

1128
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,560
catalog zones will not be publicly

1129
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,000
queried

1130
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,839
um that may be not the current intention

1131
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:25,520
but i can first see use cases where that

1132
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,520
may be useful so

1133
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,720
what we've discussed on the dns catalog

1134
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,680
metamouse zone sorry not zone channel

1135
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,560
was an idea that i had if you have a new

1136
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,839
domain and you communicate

1137
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,560
the ns record set to the registry for

1138
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,200
example to

1139
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,200
dot de then um one question in dns

1140
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,079
setups is

1141
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,520
how you get the ds records that

1142
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,359
provision for the first time

1143
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,400
and um one approach could be to

1144
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,480
take the host names in the ns record set

1145
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,720
for example ns1.whatevernameserver

1146
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,960
and use that as a catalog zone have

1147
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,880
sub-domains of the nameserver hostname

1148
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,079
itself

1149
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,240
where the registry can query properties

1150
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,319
of that name service member zones

1151
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,079
and get the cds records from there to

1152
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,560
provision ds for the first time

1153
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,400
and that of course works only if the

1154
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,240
name server zone itself is signed and

1155
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,680
there's other issues for that

1156
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,440
i'm not proposing to do this now there's

1157
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,520
of course a

1158
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,720
large amount of questions that it's

1159
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,880
unclear but to me it's not clear that

1160
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,800
catalog zones will not be queried

1161
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,680
by some external actor in the future so

1162
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,480
we should have

1163
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,400
something that is clean conceptually

1164
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,040
okay thank you um i close

1165
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,720
the session of this uh this agenda item

1166
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,480
um thank you all there has there is an

1167
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,760
uh metamouse instance

1168
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,640
channel to discuss the more

1169
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,240
implementation details

1170
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,559
so of course the protocol discussion

1171
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,359
needs to be

1172
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,680
take needs to take place on the the

1173
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,079
mailing list the dean is up mailing list

1174
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,319
but ask the authors if you're interested

1175
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:07,280
to be

1176
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,960
to be involved a little bit more into

1177
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,440
the details and the implementation

1178
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,680
ask them how to get on the metamouse

1179
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,880
oarch

1180
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,440
channel for the catalog zones it's open

1181
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,119
for everyone

1182
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,160
um okay

1183
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,520
any other maybe well let's go

1184
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,920
forward to the next session to the next

1185
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,030
item

1186
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,319
[Music]

1187
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,440
right paul yeah excellent

1188
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,680
i will run the slides for you paul yes

1189
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,000
please

1190
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,078
okay yes

1191
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,960
oh wait a minute well moments

1192
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:03,839
there we are uh

1193
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,760
i'm not seeing them if you are i'm

1194
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,160
that

1195
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,200
it's here yeah okay

1196
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,879
there we are great thank you

1197
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,079
okay so um greetings and

1198
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,319
as someone said we need we need a new

1199
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,359
term that is not

1200
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,319
good morning good evening good afternoon

1201
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:32,960
so

1202
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,640
it's good morning for me um so

1203
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,599
this draft basically you know we

1204
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,280
discussed it at the last meeting we're

1205
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,839
here now

1206
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,640
um and uh i'd like to give just a very

1207
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,839
brief overview

1208
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,680
and then if there's more discussion i

1209
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,200
think it's best on the list

1210
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,359
um we did a lot of mike line the last

1211
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,359
time um that didn't go to the list i

1212
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,359
would rather see stuff on the list

1213
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,839
next slide

1214
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,200
so this you know

1215
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
after the last meeting i had done this

1216
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,960
as personal document it was adopted as

1217
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,319
working group document

1218
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,880
um after the last meeting which was in

1219
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:15,680
november

1220
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,200
which i guess everything is still in

1221
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,800
march of 2020

1222
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,400
um i published the zero zero in january

1223
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,280
it's really short if you remove the

1224
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,119
normal front and back stuff it's like a

1225
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,880
page and a half of tech so

1226
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,119
um if you're wanting to read a short

1227
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,240
draft this is

1228
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,200
this is your draft um but there was no

1229
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,400
discussion on the list

1230
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,319
um modulo something that um just got

1231
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,920
posted this morning

1232
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,960
uh which is cool but um

1233
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,000
i you know clearly if people have you

1234
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,200
know concerns it

1235
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,880
they should be on the list so thank you

1236
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,880
for to vladimir for posting it

1237
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,440
an hour ago but really we've had no

1238
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:56,480
discussion so

1239
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,000
maybe it's ready for working group last

1240
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,559
call and that will bring out discussion

1241
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,240
um i don't know next slide

1242
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,720
so there are two motivations here one is

1243
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,400
the goss bist draft which again needs to

1244
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,079
be on standards track which means we

1245
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,599
have to prove it as a standard even

1246
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,079
though

1247
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,599
basically none of us understand it

1248
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,640
and and i'm not picking on gost at all

1249
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,839
it's a national standard um

1250
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:30,160
but other working groups other protocols

1251
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
don't require standards track they

1252
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,520
require rfc

1253
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,480
published and so for example just

1254
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,319
literally just yesterday

1255
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,359
uh for tls a new um chinese

1256
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,359
national standard whose name i'm

1257
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,680
actually forgetting but it's in

1258
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,960
rfc 8998 um

1259
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,760
was published um informational went

1260
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,240
through

1261
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,640
the independent submissions editor had

1262
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,040
plenty of comments from tls active

1263
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,319
people

1264
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,839
because the independent submission

1265
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,280
editor always does that anyways

1266
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,839
so one of the motivations is for us to

1267
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:06,720
start being

1268
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,599
like other ones you know for national

1269
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,400
standards

1270
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,440
um the other

1271
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,640
the other motivation is quite frankly

1272
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,520
we're facing you know with with new post

1273
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,480
quantum

1274
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,760
algorithms coming we're facing a deluge

1275
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,319
of signature algorithms um there are

1276
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,000
already a bunch of proposals

1277
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,119
and in the last few weeks nist

1278
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,720
proposed that it might in fact

1279
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,920
not pick one but it might say let's try

1280
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,839
a whole bunch of these for a while and

1281
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,119
then we'll pick one

1282
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,599
which would mean if and since we're not

1283
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,960
going to know ahead of time which ones

1284
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,000
we want

1285
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,760
it would mean putting a zillion of these

1286
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,280
on standards track which is much more

1287
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,000
heavy weight

1288
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,920
than just saying rfc required so these

1289
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,520
are the two motivations

1290
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,079
next slide

1291
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,440
um so before this draft

1292
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,200
was was even started we had rfc 6014

1293
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,720
which dnsx did in 2010

1294
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,440
um which made all of the the dns

1295
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,920
registries rfc required

1296
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,839
except they forgot dns uh ds and nsac

1297
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:20,640
records

1298
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,640
um and there was no justification for

1299
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,079
forgetting ds and nsac

1300
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,280
they probably just forgot them um but we

1301
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,040
also in this working group

1302
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,400
just recently did rfc 8624

1303
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,640
which is algorithm implementation

1304
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,880
requirements and usage guidelines

1305
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,240
so not what is and is not allowed

1306
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,680
but what the usage guidelines

1307
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,480
for these algorithms are and in that

1308
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,680
document it talks about

1309
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,920
gost as a may but it doesn't say

1310
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,079
anything about any other national

1311
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,280
algorithms simply because we don't have

1312
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,280
those yet

1313
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,720
so what i intended to do and i think

1314
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,520
i did okay was to combine the best of

1315
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,880
rfc 6014 and 8624

1316
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,160
with the idea that what we want to do is

1317
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,720
is to have all of our algorithms

1318
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,079
including ds and n

1319
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,520
second and sec 3 b have the same

1320
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,640
requirements

1321
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,920
and to make sure that 8624 which a lot

1322
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,160
of people are following

1323
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,759
to be correct next slide

1324
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,079
also i also had the motivation of trying

1325
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,760
to keep it under two pages i think i did

1326
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,559
that

1327
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,640
um so what this draft does

1328
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,420
is that it updates

1329
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,880
[Music]

1330
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,000
6014 to make it rfc required it updates

1331
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,240
8624

1332
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,480
to automate automatically make these

1333
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,599
non-standard track

1334
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,960
algorithms may implement

1335
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,240
um i of these two i think the 8624

1336
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,359
is the most important um that is

1337
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,920
that people who are follow you know

1338
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,680
implementers who are saying well what do

1339
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,280
i do with all of these

1340
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,280
that they will have a specific statement

1341
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,319
saying it's

1342
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,480
just a may you can do what you want

1343
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,680
other others can do

1344
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,280
what they want if there is a point later

1345
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:17,920
where

1346
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,160
a national standard is widely adopted

1347
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,040
or that the working group wants it to be

1348
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,799
widely adopted

1349
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,000
then you can upgrade in you you can

1350
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,160
update 8624 to say

1351
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,160
and i think we are going to update 8624

1352
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,359
in the future anyways

1353
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,079
to say this one now has gone from made

1354
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,599
should or whatever

1355
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,760
um my third bullet where i say that's

1356
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,880
all is actually incorrect as vladimir uh

1357
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,760
pointed out

1358
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,440
in the one comment that came in about

1359
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
this an hour and a half ago

1360
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,799
um which is that i also um

1361
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,960
in the iana considerations i also make

1362
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,839
the nsec

1363
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,760
3 and nsec3 parameters flags also be rfc

1364
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,599
required and vladimir asked

1365
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,520
isn't that dangerous we've only got a

1366
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,200
few of them there's like seven left or

1367
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,839
whatever

1368
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:08,880
um but no it's not dangerous in that if

1369
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,480
all of a sudden they start filling up we

1370
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,880
change that um

1371
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,000
basically i'm trying to bring into

1372
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,240
you know the dns world into align with

1373
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,160
the algorithm choices made

1374
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,319
by everyone else and they have these

1375
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,280
limited flags

1376
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,880
also with small amounts

1377
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
the assumption is we're going to be

1378
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,720
following what's going on

1379
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,319
none of this is going to happen behind

1380
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,319
our backs so for example let's say

1381
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,440
someone comes out

1382
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,559
and has a new insect 3 parameter that

1383
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,680
they want a new flag

1384
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,599
for dns op is going to be alerted of it

1385
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,520
certainly the isg is going to be alerted

1386
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,720
of it um

1387
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,160
even if they go through the independent

1388
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,839
stream editor there's going to be

1389
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:50,799
reviews

1390
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,720
and some of the reviews might say hey

1391
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,240
don't do this or whatever

1392
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,280
and so we're not going to get blindsided

1393
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,200
by by all of a sudden running out of

1394
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,040
flags or anything like that or

1395
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,880
we're not going to get blindsided by

1396
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,520
someone saying i didn't even know

1397
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,240
that there was such a new national

1398
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,040
algorithm

1399
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,880
there will be stuff sent to the list

1400
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,400
it's really a question of

1401
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,640
does the working group have to make a

1402
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,319
standard for each one

1403
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,960
next slide and i think that's it or

1404
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,680
maybe that's it

1405
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,720
i guess that was the last one that was

1406
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,599
it yeah

1407
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,480
thank you okay so that's all um modulo

1408
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,200
the one thing that

1409
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,359
that uh vladimir brought on the list so

1410
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,119
i'm open for questions but again

1411
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,440
my preference would be that we actually

1412
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,200
discussed this on the mailing list

1413
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,240
so good yeah

1414
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,520
jim please go ahead

1415
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,720
jim we can't hear your accent

1416
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,200
okay i will try speaking in the queen's

1417
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,960
english

1418
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
i think this is a lovely little draft

1419
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,960
and long overdue paul

1420
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,720
i think we should just go straight to

1421
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,880
last call i don't think we need to have

1422
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,559
further discussion about this

1423
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,599
to any great extent there might be some

1424
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,520
meta issues around things like

1425
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,000
the choice of algorithms having me or

1426
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,440
recommended those shoots

1427
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,079
associated with them but i don't think

1428
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:20,720
that

1429
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,799
affects this draft in any way i think

1430
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:24,319
that stuff probably needs to go into a

1431
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,599
separate document

1432
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,200
that explains to people that are doing

1433
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,880
dns sex stuff with

1434
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,680
new crypto what their choices are crypto

1435
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,359
algorithms might mean from the point of

1436
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,000
view of

1437
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,119
interoperability or security because the

1438
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,119
fact they may or may not be validated

1439
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,880
as they're not necessarily recommended

1440
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,040
algorithms that i think is inside

1441
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,960
an entirely separate issue and not

1442
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,400
something for this document

1443
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,680
i think we're just going ahead and get

1444
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,040
this thing out the door as quickly as

1445
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,839
possible

1446
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,240
thank you dmitry

1447
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,040

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,079
i support

1450
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,680
paul's suggestion because

1451
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:17,440
if this policy exists

1452
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,040
two years ago i've already

1453
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,599
finalized my job but

1454
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,160
i want to get clarification on the

1455
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,839
procedure

1456
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,880
of my draft in current circumstances

1457
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,880
thank you thank you uh jim

1458

necessary we do have some

1460
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,640
five minutes in the next session but

1461
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,480
please go ahead

1462
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,559
and sir i've just i forgot to put my

1463
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,920

thank you thank you for your feedback

1467
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,200
working group

1468
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,960
indeed as paul asked also send some

1469
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,680
comments or feedback on the mailing list

1470
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,559
and

1471
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,119
as i understand and also the question of

1472
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,440
the author but also from

1473
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,280
jim and maybe others up to a working

1474
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,640
group last call

1475
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,160
in well a couple of weeks we will

1476
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,520
coordinate it with the author and the

1477
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,799
dnos hope

1478
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:26,400
chairs is that fine with you paul

1479

absolutely absolutely and it sounds like

1480
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,760
especially since

1481
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,880
i'm blocking dimitri you know

1482
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,000
this could be a twofer

1483
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:39,359
okay great thank you susan you have some

1484
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:40,400
closing remarks

1485
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,839
for before the next session

1486
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,000
sure why not um that's that concludes

1487

the other one because um they are in

1491
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,040
separate this sessions are in separate

rooms

1493
