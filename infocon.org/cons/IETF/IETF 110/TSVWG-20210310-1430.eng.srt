has been added me materials okay

121
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,599
so the first thing we gotta do

122
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,319
is talk about what we're trying to get

123
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,319
done this is the chairs

124
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,000
uh view of what needs to be done

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
uh on the lforest drafts so i'm gonna

126
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,759
read this and with luck uh between

127
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,319
myself

128
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,400
other chairs and some discussion we'll

129
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
have some clarity what needs to happen

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
so there's two there's two items um that

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
coming to this meeting

132
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,400
need attention the first is transfer

133
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,160
protocol independent requirements to ucl

134
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,199
forest service

135
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,240
and the goal here is um

136
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
interoperability multiple transfer

137
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
protocols able to meet requirements

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,958
specs

139
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
and or implementations working group

140
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,039
gets to decide what is sufficient

141
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,560
um and that uh the dock that is crucial

142
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,120
to this

143
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,560
is the ecn l4s id draft

144
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
the second uh thing needs to be done is

145
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
safety of internet wide

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
authorized experiment we really do not

147
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,320
want to break the internet

148
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,360
uh in doing this uh goal is

149
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,399
that the uh experiment is unlikely cause

150
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,760
it can damage the internet

151
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,839
and any damage results is expected to be

152
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,880
tolerable

153
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
the draft for this is the l4s

154
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
ops draft and i'll reiterate something

155
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,920
you said before

156
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,680
working with last calling alphas office

157
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,440
draft is not required to meet the safety

158
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,160
goal

159
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,720
so that that's not required what is the

160
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,680
criteria for

161
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
both goals is working group rough

162
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
consensus that each goal

163
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,080
has been reached and the working group

164
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
chairs

165
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
we'll put on our kevlar we'll put in our

166
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,320
kevlar vests and figure out how to run

167
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,000
initial consensus calls before the next

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,040
ietf meeting week okay

169
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,199

dead silence i was not expecting that

172
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,560
this this this those slides can't be

173
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:04,480
that good

174
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,640
all right i will call people bob

175
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
greg kuhn is this reasonably clear

176
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,480
and within reason

177
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
can i say um go first um

178
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,680
yeah i i that it's relatively clear yeah

179
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,079
um i just wanted the answers to the

180
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,920
questions i put on the mailing list

181
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
which is which is more about the text in

182
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
earlier emails and and just just to get

183
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
a confirmation that

184
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
you didn't mean it rather it just

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,000
disappeared you know

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,120
um because this has become a bit of a

187
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,560
no i don't want that rocket go and get

188
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
another rock sort of um

189
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,160
type thing okay so okay to continue that

190
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,279
in to continue that

191
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,920
this this slide contains the

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
descriptions of the two

193
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,839
rocks get those two rocks and we'll and

194
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,279
and we'll be and and we'll be in good

195
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,560
shape um

196
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,519
i um the crucial question i think you

197
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,519
asked about whether i meant it was

198
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,040
do we need two interoperable

199
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,000
implementations of the transport

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,959
protocols

201
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
honorable for us the answer is no

202
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
working group gets to decide gets to

203
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
decide what suffices

204
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
the chairs will be satisfied the working

205
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,839
group believes that

206
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
um um that uh the requirements uh on the

207
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,320
transport protocols

208
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,079
are interoperable yeah i mean

209
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,560
so um we're talking about the

210
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,000
a specification with some requirements

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and our implementations but we're not

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,519
talking about interop here we're not

213
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,399
this isn't ps

214
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,360
status this is just existence status

215
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,320
right does that help

216
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,240
basically we we the group the goal is

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
the working group needs to be convinced

218
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,160
by rough consensus

219
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
that the requirements and transport

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,519
protocols are transfer protocol

221
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,360
independent

222
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
i'm not i'm not worried about the

223
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
interrupt thing i'm worried most of the

224
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
requirements about performance

225
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,240
and and that's not interrupt and so it's

226
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
you know or relative performance and

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
stuff like that so

228
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,079
um i'm you notice that word doesn't

229
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,519
appear on this slide

230
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,800
that was that's deliberate okay

231
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,920
um performance and safety are not the

232
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,959
same thing

233
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,240
however um complete absence of

234
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,920
performance i.e you can't

235
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,560
get traffic there from here starts to

236
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
look a whole lot like scenes yeah yeah

237
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,519
yeah i mean

238
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
okay and we're on the same page here

239
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
because

240
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,120
fundamentally yeah this is fundamentally

241
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
a a the working group is going to have

242
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,440
to make

243
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,560
make a to bar to borrow a badly used

244
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
phrase rick was going to have to make a

245
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,480
i know it when i see it decision on

246
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,560
safety

247
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,959
okay let's move on um unless one of the

248
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,839
other guys wants to say something

249
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
go ahead yeah can you hear me um yeah

250
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
maybe

251
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,720
the the the presentation that i will

252
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
give will give also some insight on

253
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,800
on what implementations or plant

254
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
implementations that we have so

255
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,800
um hopefully that will help uh to decide

256
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,839
whether it's the first point at least is

257
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,040
sufficient

258
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,800
sounds good that's good thank you

259
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
jake

260
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,399
uh yeah hi um one one question about the

261
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,240
uh last bullet point on number two

262
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,560
uh

263
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,800
is is this a like already determined

264
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
uh criteria or is that like

265
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
a sort of goal in number two or

266
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
the the working group last call on l4s

267
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,880
ops not required to meet safety goal

268
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
like i wasn't yeah the the the primary

269
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
reason for that point

270
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,600
being here is that if the working group

271
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,240
believes that the l4s ops draft

272
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,440
lays out a reasonable safety case

273
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,959
but there is still quite a bit of work

274
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,680
to be done on it that's not a reason to

275
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,480
hold up work group last call on the elf

276
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,160
restaurant on the alphas drafts

277
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,920
okay um and this is a point for

278
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
discussion

279
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
so important for discussion it's a point

280
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
jake we discussed last time

281
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,760
round where we talked about would the

282
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
experiment actually help to inform the

283
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
operational draft

284
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
to inform how operators did things so

285
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,240
did we want to close this before

286
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
we started the publication process or

287
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
did we want to make sure it was

288
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,639
reasonably good

289
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,399
shape and then allow that draft to

290
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,240
mature a little bit in the working group

291
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,040
and we didn't really decide on how much

292
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,399
maturing was actually useful needed

293
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,320
so this is the space in which the

294
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,360
adoption call is being held

295
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,880
uh okay sure i mean

296
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,199
i guess

297
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,639
so this is about reaching consensus on

298
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,760
these points right

299
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,720
my only point is like i i am i tend to

300
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,000
be of the opinion that

301
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
uh that i i would like to see

302
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,199
a normative normative language

303
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
somewhere in the experiment uh perhaps

304
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,360
referencing the draft

305
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
i'm not sure whether the uh whether the

306
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
core l4s drafts

307
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
uh go forward but in the in the uh

308
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,320
in the i guess we can get to that uh

309
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,880
later after the adoption call perhaps we

310
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,480
can certainly get to that

311
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,160
at working group last call on the

312
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
alpharestraf requesting a

313
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,480
normative reference from the alpharest

314
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,279
uh drafts to the l4s ops

315
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
so they have to go forward as rfcs

316
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
together is completely reasonable

317
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,040
uh as a last call topic if not

318
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,519
yeah thank you

319
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
jay can i can i ask a question about the

320
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,480
normative language what are you saying

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,079
there might be normative language around

322
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,399
the operations

323
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,399
aspects that we somehow have to capture

324
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,519
in the working group is that

325
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,959
the comment uh yeah i guess

326
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,000
um i mean you know i'm not sure exactly

327
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,519
what form it would take but um but

328
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,639
uh sort of the the to rephrase the

329
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,360
opinion i

330
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,759
put forth before i think that the sort

331
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:32,560
of current

332
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
um tcp prog implementation seems

333
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
incompatible with classic cues et cetera

334
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,959
uh in source sense and uh

335
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,120
therefore like the sort of guidance

336
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,720
around um

337
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,480
as a l4s sender ensuring that that

338
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,000
you're operating on paths that do not

339
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,480
contain uh

340
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,800
classic cues is

341
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,000
is part of the safety story in such a

342
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,440
way that that

343
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,119
i i would prefer to see some kind of

344
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,160
at least should uh to that effect and

345
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,079
and the details of how the drafts

346
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,439
precisely point to each other and

347
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,919
whether it has to be an rfc first

348
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,160
i'm i'm flexible on but uh okay

349
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,919
that flexibility was the primary point

350
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,679
of that bullet let's go

351
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,359
and let you that is an excuse to

352
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,280
transition to the office draft

353
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,120
oh thank you let's see am i supposed to

354
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,840
greg slides or greg do you input your

355
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,039
slides

356
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,720
you could do it that would be fantastic

357
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,960
but all right which means i gotta go get

358
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,799
not tried

359
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,039
um hang on a minute i gotta go get him

360
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
okay

361
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
and i guess the position of the chairs

362
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,320
on the normative languages if we need

363
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
normative language for the ops

364
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
work if that's what the working group

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
concedes then there will be a place to

366
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,840
put that normative language if that's if

367
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,440
that's what comes out we'll find a place

368
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
to do it

369
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,960
if the working group needs it so the

370
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
fact that this is put up for adoption

371
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,600
as informational doesn't constrain the

372
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
working group from making

373
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,120
um rst219 language if we need it

374
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,640
all right let's go blink the screen and

375
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,280
a little bit few more clicks

376
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,200
we ought to have slides

377
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,200
yeah those okay all right greg i

378
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,880
should be up and tell me when you want

379
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,720
what want me to advance slides

380
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
okay thanks um all right so this is the

381
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,160
second

382
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
or except the third iteration of the

383
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,760
alphas ops

384
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,440
draft and just to reiterate what

385
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
i said last time i presented i'm the

386
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
editor of this document

387
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,760
um the contributors include those listed

388
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,600
at the bottom as well as

389
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
probably others on the working group who

390
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,440
have done reviews and

391
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,400
um and made suggestions um hopefully i

392
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,360
didn't miss

393
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,959
uh folks but uh um

394
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,520
contributions of text to improve the

395
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,240
draft are

396
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,600
welcome and i assume if this gets

397
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,080
adopted

398
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,919
by the working group that we'll see more

399
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,919
of you and and more contributions so

400
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,960
um our next slide

401
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
uh the scope of the draft um so as the

402
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,480
the name

403
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,559
of it is operational guidance for

404
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,520
deployment of l4s and the internet

405
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,440
that may sound like it's covering more

406
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,880
ground than it actually

407
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,400
is the scope of the craft actually

408
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,960
is specific to the issue of uh

409
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,679
coexistence of l4s traffic and classic

410
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,640
traffic

411
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
in an rfc 3168 bottleneck

412
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,440
it has expanded uh since the last

413
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,160
iteration and to now discuss vpns in fq

414
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
bottlenecks as well as single cube

415
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,039
bottlenecks um although more

416
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,640
elaboration that could certainly be

417
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,559
added

418
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,160
the goal is to provide guidance for

419
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
operators of

420
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,440
l4s hosts as they deploy all for us

421
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,080
on the internet also guidance for

422
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
operators of networks in particular

423
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,400
networks that are currently running rfc

424
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,840
3168 links

425
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,760
and then finally recommendations for

426
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960
researchers

427
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,559
and the goal of this document is not

428
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,520
uh just to cover in-band detection and

429
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,080
fallback

430
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
and that's an aspect that's been

431
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,360
discussed um within the working group

432
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,039
paramount over the last

433
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,480
year or more um it does include that but

434
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
it also includes some other aspects

435
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:49,840
related to safe deployment of l4s

436
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,840
greg he's still there

437
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,840
we seem to have lost greg's audio

438
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
i lost great video as well so um he'll

439
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,760
be back in a moment i guess

440
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,400
okay

441
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
probably needs an l4s service to run

442
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,720
effectively

443
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,520
gee that was coming wasn't it

444
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,159
say to the standard qn would work

445
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,679
all right all right

446
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,500
i think that was the problem

447
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,800
[Laughter]

448
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
well we'll we'll wait a couple of

449
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,799
minutes to see if greg rejoices since

450
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,919
he's in the middle of a pitch for

451
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,400
adoption

452
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,000
miracle helpfully says in the chat that

453
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
greg lost connectivity and left

454
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,960
and left the room well that's very

455
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,280
helpful

456
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,840
we could check in the meantime if people

457
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,240
have read the document and uh

458
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
yes excellent why don't we start to pull

459
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,720
can we work out how to do that on the

460
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,120
tools i'll let you go

461
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,880
fight that i'm i'm just trying to make

462
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,480
sure this lights work

463
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,840
for many people

464
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,559
so i just started a poll if you go to

465
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,600
the little bar

466
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,760
chart at the top this one's an easy one

467
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,919
how many people have read

468
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,400
the oh you spelled people correctly i

469
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,120
didn't

470
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,679
i have read the ops draft in one of its

471
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,440
versions just so we're going to feel as

472
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,640
a working group

473
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,159
if you click on that please if you've

474
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,440
read one of these versions so we know

475
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,640
whether we're judging something that

476
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,840
people have actually seen

477
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,320
i see jake's looking for the pole in the

478
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,640
meat

479
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
echo uh icons the upper right is the

480
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:37,840
thing that looks like a bar chart

481
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,520
not the most intuitive icon i think that

482
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,279
was designed for the chairs the posts

483
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
and people who are who are supposed to

484
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,080
uh participate

485
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,640
okay so she i currently see

486
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,400
14 people have raised hands 25 have

487
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
not pressed the do not raise hand button

488
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,360
of 85 participants so we have

489
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
um a number of people who've raised

490
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,799
their hands saying that they've read

491
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,000
this

492
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,240
and i'm going to end the session just

493
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,279
now

494
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,039
and then we'll go back to greg's

495
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,480
presentation

496
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,039
i'll report for the notes how many

497
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,080
finally

498
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,480
finally we had 17 people said that

499
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,279
they'd read

500
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,159
this or a recent version of the ops

501
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:26,640
draft

502
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,360
so 17 had read it and we'll continue

503
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,240
this

504
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,360
after greg's talk if greg's able to join

505
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,559
us now

506
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,840
uh hopefully you can hear me yes welcome

507
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,559
back

508
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,279
great i'm not sure when uh when you lost

509
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:41,600
me

510
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
um uh did i get through the school play

511
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,320
probably about the probably about at uh

512
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,080
somewhere after uh provide

513
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
recommendations to researchers if you

514
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,520
quickly cover the last two thirds of the

515
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,799
slide let's see if we

516
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,000
move through the rest of the slides

517
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,039
quickly okay um well the middle bullet

518
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,559
is um

519
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,120
uh just a high level scope well it's a

520
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
little bit more detailed than the

521
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,640
top bullet um but in a couple slides

522
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,760
we'll go through

523
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,640
the a summary of the contents um so i

524
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,760
won't spend time on that one

525
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
um the last bullet is just to point out

526
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,679
that um

527
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,679
general requirements for the experiment

528
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,720
etc

529
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,039
are intended to be included in the core

530
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,120
l4s drafts

531
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,400
not in this one but this draft does rely

532
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
on requirements that

533
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
exist in the l4s id draft including the

534
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,640
ability for

535
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,520
a host to disable the l4s functionality

536
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,159
and

537
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
for a host to monitor uh or provide

538
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
statistics that can be used to monitor

539
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,159
for presence of rfc 3168

540
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
all right next slide um status

541
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,880
this is the third version of the draft

542
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,559
previous ones were discussed on previous

543
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,240
ietfs a new

544
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,880
material this time addressed some

545
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
comments around

546
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,039
uh mentioning mentioning vpns and fq

547
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,799
coddle that combination

548
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,279
as well as uh added discussion on

549
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:03,840
fairness

550
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,120
and purple awareness and um

551
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,200
and then some general text improvements

552
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,799
um which we can

553
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
just go on to the next slide do you

554
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
think greg do you think the draft is to

555
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,000
the point where review by

556
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
uh operations folks would be helpful

557
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,320
it's visually complete and operating

558
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
that having operator folks look and tell

559
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,760
us whether whether

560
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,679
whether it's reasonably useful would be

561
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,880
good or do you need another spin on this

562
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
i think it's at a state now where that

563
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
would be useful

564
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,640
cool we'll have to see if we can do that

565
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,799
okay

566
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,440
all right so this is a summary of the in

567
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,880
the contents of the draft

568
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
um and um

569
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
i think an interest of time how much

570
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,080
detail to go through here

571
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,279
um top piece the draft graph does

572
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,000
discuss

573
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,120
uh prevalence of the issue and severity

574
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,240
of the outcomes um that

575
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,000
that was a comment that was made

576
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
recently on the mailing list that

577
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,240
more material there could be helpful so

578
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,440
i don't disagree with that

579
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,320
um so certainly would welcome

580
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,679
contributions uh

581
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,880
in that section um but the general

582
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,240
uh uh statement of the draft is that l4s

583
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,399
coexist well with classic traffic

584
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,080
aside from this issue with shared 3168

585
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,640
cues

586
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,880
um and the two uh

587
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,640
uh scenarios where where that um

588
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,960
that comes into play um then that's and

589
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,640
then it's primarily an issue for long

590
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,080
running flows to high data rates with

591
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,520
long rtts

592
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,279
um and the result of it is lforce flows

593
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,880
out competing classic flows

594
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,440
to one degree or another depending on

595
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,679
the scenario

596
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,679
and then has a summary of some

597
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,200
historical issues around peripheral

598
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,720
awareness

599
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
uh the next bullet um there's a section

600
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,240
that

601
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,279
that is dedicated to talking about

602
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,159
detection of

603
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,360
3168 bottlenecks via experiments

604
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,039
and then that section is uh um

605
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,159
essentially a intended to be useful not

606
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,600
just for

607
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,679
researchers doing experiments but also

608
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,880
for

609
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,240
l4s host deployers to do experiments

610
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,320
prior to turning on l4s or as part of

611
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,760
their a b testing

612
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,520
as they enable a new congestion control

613
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,200
right now that section is essentially a

614
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
pointer to the fallback report

615
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
um the link on the lower right hand side

616
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,159
um but the intention is that

617
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,200
we will summarize some of the most

618
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
important

619
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,520
um uh methods that are in that

620
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,240
that report in the draft itself um but

621
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,120
now it's just

622
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,559
just a pointer um one thing to note and

623
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,159
there was some discussion on the list

624
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,440
about this idea of having l4s nodes

625
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,960
disable 3168 ecn so disable

626
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,559
ce marking of ect 0 traffic in order to

627
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,520
facilitate

628
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,799
detection of l4s versus classic

629
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,240
3168 and

630
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,919
uh bob did a fairly in-depth

631
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,159
um analysis of that and then thinking

632
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
through it and put together some slides

633
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,720
um which come to the conclusion that

634
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,120
that may not be um as useful as

635
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,520
we maybe thought it might have been a

636
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,799
few months back so

637
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,279
um so currently the draft does not

638
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,720
recommend or

639
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
assume that l4s nodes are are doing

640
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,120
um that disabling of 3160 adcn

641
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,919
and then the last two bullets guidance

642
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:48,880
for operators of

643
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,000
of hosts and guidance for operators of

644
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,320
networks that have bottlenecks or the

645
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,830
specific

646
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,520
[Music]

647
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,880
guidance and uh and recommendations for

648
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,399
those two constituents and particularly

649
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,600
on the host side we've

650
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,840
broken it out into general purpose

651
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,799
servers

652
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,440
eg web server servers versus more

653
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
specialized servers for example cloud

654
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
gaming cloud vr

655
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,159
type applications your non-tcp

656
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,360
applications and then also a partition

657
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
between edge servers which serve a small

658
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,760
population of networks or hosts

659
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,640
versus more general hosts that may be

660
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,520
serving

661
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,080
content across longer paths or a broader

662
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,120
set of

663
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,559
hosts all right next slide

664
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,840
um there were some comments on the

665
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,679
mailing list since the posting of draft

666
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,320
02.

667
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,960
um as this summarizes those um

668
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,799
and how are we doing on time do we have

669
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,399
time to discuss these or should i just

670
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,360
mention them

671
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
we should probably just simply i think

672
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
what you want to do is say that you've

673
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,799
uh taken a look at these some of them

674
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,240
dealt with some haven't been and let's

675
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,480
get on to some open discussion here

676
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,000
so that sounds good yeah so this is just

677
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,919
a summary of those issues

678
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,120
um we'll work on um

679
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,640
well we'll be the mailing list as well

680
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
as um you know people have contributions

681
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,360
with text

682
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,720
that will improve the draft certainly

683
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,640
those would be um useful

684
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,760
all right okay last slide then is um

685
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,279
some site says adoption call in progress

686
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,360
um and i think it's productive to leave

687
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,399
this slide up

688
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,120
and uh open for discussion and comments

689
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,080
jonathan you're first go ahead

690
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,600
okay now i could say a lot here but

691
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,039
i will restrict myself to uh talking

692
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:43,679
about the

693
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,000
long flows thing from the previous slide

694
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
um and i'll just say that i disagree

695
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,600
with that statement

696
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,360
and we should um open a discussion about

697
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,399
it on the list

698
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,080
in the interests of meeting time

699
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:14,640
okay thank you okay

700
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,799
are there any more questions or

701
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,240
clarifications for people

702
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,679
on what greg has presented

703
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,240
all right i think we probably got to run

704
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,760
a sense the room poll

705
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,440
on draft adoption you want to do the

706
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,279
honors corey and maybe people can find

707
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,080
the uh

708
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,080
uh and find the tool this time

709
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,720
i have done it so we're asking here

710
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,360
how many people think this id this

711
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,240
internet draft

712
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,880
forms a basis for a work item in tsvwg

713
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
i.e they support adoption and

714
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
progression in the working group

715
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,039
this is a basis for preparing a

716
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,679
milestone for work on this

717
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,679
please raise your hand if you support it

718
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,159
please do press the do not raise hand

719
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,799
if you think this is not a basis for

720
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
work

721
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,440
and don't and don't press either option

722
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,480
if uh

723
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
you prefer not to express expression

724
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,240
opinion either way

725
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,519
or if you haven't read it yet so

726
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,960
we won't hold that again we won't hold

727
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,840
that against you

728
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,039
okay so the numbers are settling down

729
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,320
um please go to the um

730
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,880
graph icon and press it if you wish to

731
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,840
raise your hand

732
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,559
to help us judge that this is ready for

733
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,240
support

734
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,519
and please note that this is an

735
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,640
informative poll

736
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,559
we do this usually in the working group

737
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,159
to see how many people have read

738
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,039
the document we do monitor the list and

739
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,039
we also take this as input but we do the

740
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,440
actual call on the working group list

741
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,360
where the adoption call is in progress

742
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
so that will conclude

743
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
after the ietf meeting so we won't be

744
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,799
making an announcement

745
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,879
at this meeting okay we have a stable

746
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,520
entry we have i'm going to close it and

747
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,560
report the numbers

748
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,159
so 25 people think this id forms a basis

749
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,440
for work

750
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,320
in tsvwg to support adoption and

751
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,560
progression in the working group

752
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,719
thank you greg for presenting that

753
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,239
please make sure

754
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,399
you record any comments you might have

755
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,079
on this in the working group

756
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,320
email so we know if there are any more

757
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,399
concerns or comments on the adoption

758
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,679
process itself

759
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,199
i will make a determination at the end

760
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,560
of the period david very good and as

761
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,280
as noted in the minutes we have one uh

762
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,839
one

763
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,119
one do not raise hand uh

764
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,520
uh i think that that i think that that

765
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,560
that qualifies

766
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,040
as sense of the room uh or since the

767
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,960
virtual room is to adopt is to adopt the

768
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
draft

769
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,200
thank you for the sign yeah i've noted

770
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,920
that one against

771
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:17,839
25 for man

772
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,680
okay it's customary at this stage if you

773
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,640
wish

774
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,079
to allow you to come to the mic and

775
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,680
say why you think that the

776
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,920
position against is one that we should

777
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,280
consider

778
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:45,839
but we don't need to

779
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,000
it might be best to to consider any

780
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,079
discussion on the list focused

781
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,680
on focus on the meristed draft

782
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,079
excellent good car do you want to say

783
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,400

all right and

792
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,560
okay um and there it is

793
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,160
how about that okay thanks um

794
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,240
so this presentation is about the prague

795
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,680
requirements survey that

796
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,760
we did on the list you might have seen

797
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,200
it hopefully

798
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,880
um so it's uh an overview

799
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,560
a quick going through it in

800
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,920
matters of time so maybe next slide

801
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,000
so these are the the results

802
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,599
that we we got so the goal of this

803
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,720
survey was to

804
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,160
uh to get uh a view on

805
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,040
how feasible realizable the the prague

806
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,880
requirements are at the moment and

807
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,560
whether they were supported by broad

808
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,040
community mainly of course people who

809
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,800
would implement congestion controls

810
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,400
so we provided a template which

811
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
listed all the normative requirements

812
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
and the three performance requirements

813
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,079
which were also part of the initial

814
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,800
tcp prague requirements set but are not

815
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,160
really requirements

816
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,760
but anyway sometimes considered as

817
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,560
important

818
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,200
uh performance requirements

819
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,599
and we asked two questions uh whether

820
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,200
you agree with this

821
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
uh whether you want to meet this

822
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,320
requirement

823
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,119
or not um and to what level and and then

824
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,079
also another column

825
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,760
to to get more explanation um

826
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,160
any issues experiences or even

827
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,320
objections you have to the requirements

828
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,200
maybe next slide

829
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,119
so we got multiple responses of which

830
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,320
three were publicly shared so that was

831
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,400
our own template because we also gave as

832
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,839
an example

833
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,560
a fielding template of the tcp prague

834
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,200
plus

835
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,800
then the scream congestion control by

836
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,800
ingimar ericsson and then we also

837
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,280
received geforce now congestion control

838
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,800
by nvidia

839
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,599
um so they are listed the the detailed

840
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,560
responses

841
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,200
they were collected on the link uh you

842
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,640
can have a look at them

843
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,680
uh for for detailed responses

844
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,000
we also got other responses shared

845
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,920
privately and at this stage we didn't

846
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
get any confirmation whether we could

847
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,560
make them public so we kept it we

848
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,000
respected that

849
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,200
but we made a consolidated summary

850
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,400
which is also available on the the same

851
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,680
well on the same page but directly in

852
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,280
the document that you can find there on

853
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,240
the link

854
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,320
next slide

855
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,440
so to give a a a quickly a big overview

856
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,119
um so these are requirements

857
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,320
which everybody was agreeing with let's

858
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,800
say

859
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,440
they would be compliant and support it

860
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,680
or plan to support that

861
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,040
um it are obviously the obvious ones

862
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,920
which you need to make it work you could

863
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,560
say

864
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,920
um maybe zooming in uh

865
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,040
so alpha sender must set ecte

866
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,400
field to ect1 ecn field to ect1

867
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,599
there was a concern or or a remark

868
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,400
mentioned that operating system apis and

869
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,040
kernels

870
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,359
did not support it yet so it would be

871
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,480
interesting to know

872
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,640
what stops these operating systems and

873
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,920
kernels to put

874
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,440
these functionalities into their

875
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,359
mainstream uh

876
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,960
is it really the the the release of rfcs

877
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,160
of these documents or

878
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,200
or something else so if

879
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,560
if there is some insight in in that um

880
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,319
that would be useful because it is it

881
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,920
would be useful to have these

882
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,400
apis today already and that the kind of

883
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,240
rollout could begin to

884
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,520
to be less uh hurdled by experiments

885
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,440
and then another thing maybe i zoom in

886
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,319
um provide feedback to the extent of ce

887
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:34,880
marking

888
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,720
everybody wants that of obviously but

889
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,640
for the accurate ecn for the tcp

890
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,880
protocol for other protocols there were

891
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,640
not really

892
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,800
there were not any problems mentioned

893
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,880
but for

894
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
tcp itself the accurate ecn there were

895
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,800
still some remaining concerns

896
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,560
i think they need to be handled in the

897
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,240
tcpm working group

898
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,760
as soon as possible let's say

899
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,319
also the most reduced rtt bias was

900
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:09,520
broadly accepted

901
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,160
and also not part of the requirements

902
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,560
also for the long-run trip times

903
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
they would implement or already

904
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,839
implement this

905
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,359
um and also another one the rack

906
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,200
requirement let's say you should should

907
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,079
take loss by in in time based units

908
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,119
uh all of them did already or are

909
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:31,839
planning to

910
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,040
to do this the also the non-normative

911
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,920
performance

912
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,680
suggestions were all accepted and

913
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,200
seen feasible and and the results on the

914
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,599
draft were only minor clarifications

915
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,960
let's say that were asked

916
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,839
next slide

917
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,280
the the only strong objection that we

918
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,680
got on the draft was

919
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,000
related to the documentation only

920
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,760
requirements i call them here

921
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,680
so must specify in in detail

922
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,240
how the congestion control works or how

923
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,560
you define quantify and justify burst

924
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,920
limit approach

925
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,040
um so the objections where are these

926
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,280
documentation requirements really needed

927
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
how can we be enforced

928
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,560
uh may not be possible for proprietary

929
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,760
protocols that don't want to share this

930
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,480
so and it would also create kind of

931
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,280
precedence i think in itf drafts to to

932
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,079
have

933
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,240
uh requirements a mandatory requirement

934
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,359
to describe the

935
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,000
implementation in detail so we we remove

936
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,400
these

937
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,119
i think that's fair enough um if you

938
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:39,920
have could you

939
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,359
uh yeah could you put in some language

940
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,920
encouraging people to publish this

941
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,800
information

942
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,240
for you for for um uh

943
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,480
use for the knowledge of the community

944
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,520
um

945
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,400
um uh i have no problem with removing

946
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,680
the must requirements i think

947
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,960
encouraging people to publish what

948
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,079
they've done is always a good thing

949
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,319
yeah i well i don't know whether it's

950
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,359
still in there but

951
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,400
it's indeed we can do

952
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,920
that i guess um then there are a set of

953
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,119
requirements

954
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,800
which needed experimental data um

955
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,440
two too high level ones at least the

956
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,599
first one is to scale down to fractional

957
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,880
congestion window

958
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,640
so not all everybody is convinced that

959
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,079
it really will be a problem on the

960
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,680
internet

961
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,040
and they are not planning to implement

962
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,200
it even

963
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,720
multiple other ones already supported

964
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,640
or have research code available

965
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,480
or plan to implement it so um

966
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,280
i think the shoot here is in the right

967
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,240
place

968
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,880
um and it is also not really a safety

969
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,280
issue per se because it's

970
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,640
already handled by the by the aqm

971
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,200
uh when when the the signal starts to

972
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,319
saturate it should

973
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,640
use drop anyway so it would only be a

974
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,800
kind of performance improvement to

975
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,359
prevent latency if there is only alpha s

976
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,400
or or drop on

977
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,000
on coupled equipments so it's

978
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,520
it's fair i think to to look at further

979
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,200
real experimental experience on on that

980
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,400
during the experiments there was some

981
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,760
updates on the draft based on

982
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,119
discussions

983
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,560
i have no idea where the shoot is

984
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,800
appropriate please make sure the draft

985
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,680
uh reflects the develop further during

986
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,280
further during experiment that this is

987
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,839
one of the things the experiment is

988
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,839
investigating

989
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,319
it does already good

990
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,119
okay gauri has a question or

991
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,839
i think you're muted curry

992
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,720
um anyway okay

993
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,078
um next

994
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,960
requirement that needed experimental

995
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,920
data

996
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,680
uh we all know is the um

997
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,040
the classic ecn detection um

998
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,960
so there are a set of uh normative

999
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,800
mustang shoots defined currently in the

1000
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,119
draft

1001
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,160
there there was some let's say uh

1002
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,440
confusion about what it exactly means

1003
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,800
meant is the detection itself required

1004
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,240
is it is it uh well the

1005
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,560
obviously the robust detection scheme

1006
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,440
needs real deployment experience

1007
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,760
and and others say but the combination

1008
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,359
with delay based control

1009
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,680
would minimize potential issues so it

1010
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,280
could also be a reason

1011
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,240
not to to have this detection per se

1012
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,680
there because it's already

1013
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,359
kind of circumvened by the latency

1014
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:59,599
aspect of it which is currently not in

1015
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,440
tcp product but several

1016
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,119
implementations have this um so

1017
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,480
um so so first of all yeah it should be

1018
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,160
clear whether it's only the monitoring

1019
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,800
which is

1020
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,520
required or also the detection is

1021
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,160
required

1022
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,560
and i think the detection

1023
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,680
needs to be developed um well it's it's

1024
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,200
part of the discussion and it's also

1025
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,640
what greg already mentioned in the

1026
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,440
operational guidelines draft

1027
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,280
also clarifications on this

1028
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,400
automatically fall back

1029
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,000
so the next requirement says must be

1030
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,280
replaceable

1031
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,760
while it could also be that the alpha s

1032
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,400
part is disabled so it becomes in the

1033
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,079
same congestion control so it becomes a

1034
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:44,720
normal

1035
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,800
uh classic response only congestion

1036
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,560
control so there are multiple

1037
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,240
implementations possible and also

1038
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,160
whether it it is required on active

1039
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,000
flows or only on new flows

1040
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,880
especially if it it is being replaced i

1041
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,720
think because of that hard statement it

1042
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,520
could be

1043
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,640
uh so so anyway uh also some

1044
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,960
um clarifications and and disambiguation

1045
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,079
uh is required there um

1046
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,359
and i think the requirements need to be

1047
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,800
aligned when the operational guidelines

1048
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,200
draft is adopted

1049
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,040
so that needs probably some further

1050
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,280
clarifications um i see jonathan and bob

1051
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,319
ask a question or

1052
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,559
jonathan you're there first let's see if

1053
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,440
we can do this

1054
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,280
briefly here as i'm sure we could have a

1055
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,040
multi-hour discussion on this if we

1056
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,839
wanted to

1057
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,000
uh yes um well mostly i

1058
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,480
noticed that the references currently

1059
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,359
are to

1060
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,720
bob viscose paper on the subject

1061
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,000
we have seen one of the algorithms uh

1062
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,760
from that paper implemented so far and

1063
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,359
uh last year and the results from that

1064
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:01,920
were not

1065
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,599
encouraging shall we say uh there is a

1066
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:06,079
second

1067
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,440
algorithm with a more active profile

1068
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,599
which seems to have a better theoretical

1069
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,119
basis

1070
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,839
but i would question how practical it is

1071
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,000
due to the volume of probe that are

1072
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,960
needed

1073
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,040
to establish a uh statistical

1074
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,280
relationship

1075
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,079
so um of course we will need to discuss

1076
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:28,480
this

1077
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,440
in more detail

1078
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
yes

1079
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,200
i just i just um wanted to come in i

1080
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,119
will also respond to jonathan

1081
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,800
what originally came to the cue just to

1082
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,480
say that we haven't changed any of the

1083
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,920
text in the draft

1084
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,359
based on all this feedback from the

1085
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,599
survey until the adoption call is

1086
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,559
finished because it

1087
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:52,480
you know that that makes a difference as

1088
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,240
to what the text is likely to be you

1089
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,200
know so

1090
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,760
um but to to respond to johnson's point

1091
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,480
yes that

1092
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,119
you've picked up the new idea we've put

1093
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,559
into that paper

1094
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,960
on using the spacing between marks to

1095
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,160
distinguish between

1096
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,760
um classic and um and

1097
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,800
um alpha s and um actually

1098
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,480
had another idea since then which isn't

1099
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,720
in there to um

1100
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,079
use a pulse or a chirp um to

1101
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,119
find whether the aqm is smoothing

1102
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,319
its response or whether it's an

1103
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,319
immediate response which i think is even

1104
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,720
possibly even even more um uh

1105
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,839
specific way of of um finding the two

1106
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,440
after it's finished it's slow start and

1107
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,359
it's found some capacity and it's

1108
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,480
got some ce marking to um

1109
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,319
to do a pulse okay so i think

1110
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,359
let's see if we can get back to those

1111
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,520
slides i think occlusion slides sounds

1112
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,040
about right which is more work

1113
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,079
more more more work needed

1114
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,800
in this more work needed in this area on

1115
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
the draft

1116
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,079
and potentially also the the deployment

1117
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:00,880
experience

1118
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,599
because um well the effectivity of all

1119
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,480
these schemes

1120
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,400
can only be evaluated during the

1121
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,520
experiment itself

1122
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,160
i think um then there was uh another

1123
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,160
compliant or at least to the intent of

1124
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,800
how i think most people will interpret

1125
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,839
the requirement

1126
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:23,440
but it could also be interpreted very

1127
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,160
strict

1128
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,880
specifically coexist safely with tcp

1129
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,480
renault congestion control

1130
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,200
a lot of concerns are what does it mean

1131
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,119
i don't want to be as degraded as reno

1132
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,480
for long rtts

1133
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,160
so so there there is already a

1134
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,400
discussion on the working group list

1135
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,960
to find the correct wordings for this

1136
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,000
requirement because

1137
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,240
indeed we don't want that the congestion

1138
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,119
controls behave

1139
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,760
exactly like reno and especially not in

1140
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:49,280
the

1141
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,280
pathological cases then the last topic

1142
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,200
maybe in general over all the

1143
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,079
requirements is uh the balance between

1144
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,240
openness to innovation and to allow

1145
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,240
multiple congestion controls

1146
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,960
and guidance and recommendations uh we

1147
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,160
saw

1148
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,520
quite some requests for how should it

1149
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,559
work how should

1150
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,599
this be done so so the

1151
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,599
the goal of the draft at the moment i

1152
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,800
think is to keep it

1153
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
open for for multiple congestion

1154
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,920
controls

1155
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,319
even that certain people might or

1156
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,240
interpret certain requirements very

1157
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,040
strict but

1158
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,359
that's definitely not our goal so if you

1159
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,079
see like

1160
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,800
specific mechanisms being defined that

1161
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,440
could be done

1162
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,960
otherwise i think the result is

1163
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,880
important and not the mechanism

1164
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,520
shouldn't be

1165
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,960
defined which doesn't mean that maybe

1166
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,319
certain numbers or

1167
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:44,400
interoperability requirements

1168
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,319
are needed um for for practical examples

1169
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,960
uh we have now also the tcp product

1170
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,079
congestion

1171
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,880
control drafts in iccrg release the

1172
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,160
first version

1173
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,839
um so there it's described what

1174
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,040
tcp prac is doing currently um but there

1175
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,000
are other

1176
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,160
open source implementations already

1177
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,680
which you can

1178
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,440
use for let's say mechanisms

1179
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,640
that could be interesting in in solving

1180
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,760
many issues or or

1181
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,400
mechanisms that can be used to to for

1182
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,480
for better performance

1183
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,880
on the red text i'd suggest a two-prong

1184
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,119
approach one is i see a list discussion

1185
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,599
on picking the precise words

1186
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,119
and the other thing i would would

1187
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:32,880
suggest is pick

1188
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,920
one or two well-known examples that do

1189
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,559
co-exist safe in tcp reno but don't have

1190
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,839
reno's long rtt

1191
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:42,640
behavior and include those and that that

1192
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,200
should get the point across

1193
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,839
okay

1194
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,559
okay thanks um as a conclusion um

1195
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,200
well it's uh i think it was a very

1196
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,680
useful exercise to get a better view on

1197
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,640
on the different positions

1198
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,559
the strong objections were removed

1199
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,079
okay there is still the suggestion we

1200
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,839
have to add

1201
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,200
but it also made clear that live

1202
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,040
data is is needed for for those two then

1203
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,920
at least um and and for the rest that

1204
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,119
there are quite already some

1205
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,160
implementations

1206
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,200
uh and and all the requirements are seen

1207
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,400
feasible and our plans to be implemented

1208
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,559
um by most of the congestion controls

1209
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,800
so other inputs are still welcome

1210
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,000
preferably public

1211
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,280
but if private we can also

1212
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,559
take those for the next iteration

1213
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,960
if needed okay that's it

1214
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,359
okay comments questions

1215
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,799
i go get bob's slides

1216
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,040
so my comment was was rather

1217
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,599
um quick it was that um there are other

1218
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,520
congestion controllers out there apart

1219
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,880
from reno

1220
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,800
and this isn't the place where we should

1221
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,760
in tsvwgb describing

1222
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,680
the complexities of sharing with

1223
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,599
different congestion controllers so

1224
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,680
we need to use language which is wide

1225
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,319
enough i think

1226
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,520
not get bogged down in the details of

1227
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,960
reno versus bbr

1228
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,000
this is cubic business yeah

1229
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,599
yeah and for that matter if the examples

1230
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,200
exist the examples

1231
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,119
will both example out of the examples

1232
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,040
would have two two benefits one is they

1233
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,680
would

1234
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,240
um clearly show people that you don't

1235
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,680
have to have reno's

1236
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:42,720
uh long rtt behavior requirement and the

1237
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,920
other is they provide additional

1238
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,920
examples congestion controls with which

1239
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,400
alpha

1240
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,160
traffic ought to coexist

1241
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,520
uh vidi i see your next in line

1242
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:58,319
the question in similar lines like i

1243
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:00,000
wanted to ask if it's

1244
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,079
during the experiment if we have seen

1245
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,000
whether uh l4s

1246
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,559
conduction controller is fair or does it

1247
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,319
coexist with cubic

1248
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,640
with cubic you know like just doing the

1249
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,680
classic ecn

1250
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,839
um well yes the current implementation

1251
00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,200
is actually reno

1252
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,920
tcp prague falls back to to reno

1253
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,440
behavior

1254
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,799
on drop so it is

1255
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,319
definitely even even with reno

1256
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,920
let's say almost compatible but um

1257
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,359
um well these are these are things that

1258
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,599
most of the implementers for real

1259
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,599
deployments want to improve obviously

1260
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,880
and um well it's

1261
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,760
it's at that level that we probably need

1262
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,640
the correct warning

1263
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,359
okay richard um just a clarification

1264
00:55:59,359 --> 00:55:59,920
question

1265
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,280
did you ask for the response um after a

1266
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,559
loss

1267
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,920
or after uh the l4s has

1268
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,119
given you a proportional metric

1269
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:13,520
by which the congestion control should

1270
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,119
react

1271
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:18,000
and then and then scale that scale that

1272
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,400
um

1273
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,240
depending on your arena or cubic

1274
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,520
i think for both

1275
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,760
loss is definitely i think one thing i

1276
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,960
think it's same i guess

1277
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,440
that's what uh coin was saying that it's

1278
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,160
same

1279
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,880
for loss it reacts in the same way for

1280
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,839
feedback

1281
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,040
what's the what's the difference or the

1282
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,599
accurate feedback maybe as a clarify

1283
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,160
clarification i didn't say that the tsp

1284
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,520
prac requirements expect that it has the

1285
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,079
same

1286
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,880
response as uh reno

1287
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,040
we want to in the tcp prague

1288
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,559
requirements or in the prague

1289
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:58,000
requirements better we

1290
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,119
want to leave that open um not describe

1291
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,040
the mechanism necessarily i think

1292
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:06,400
is is the question here when i say tcp

1293
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:06,880
prague

1294
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,359
implementation in linux this is now the

1295
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,040
current implementation but

1296
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,280
it's not like every congestion control

1297
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,119
should do this

1298
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,040
so we we have to be also tcp prague is

1299
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,079
not

1300
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,599
the uh congestion control for l4s

1301
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,000
or or rock requirements maybe we should

1302
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,280
never have called it

1303
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,799
tcp prague because it's uh

1304
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,680
the confusion is like these requirements

1305
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,559
mean

1306
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,240
that the performance is not optimal in

1307
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,079
long round trip times or whatever

1308
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,920
claims i think there are other

1309
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,280
implementations

1310
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,520
uh we are kind of building a reference

1311
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,400
implementation

1312
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,839
for for research uh we are even not

1313
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,720
service providers and or not plants to

1314
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,000
to develop

1315
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,079
robust and and very performant

1316
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,040
congestion control

1317
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,040
so it's it's up to other people who have

1318
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,839
the right

1319
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,280
uh um

1320
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,680
how do you call that the right need for

1321
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,839
it to to develop it i think um

1322
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,640
and and it shouldn't be like relying on

1323
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,119
us to

1324
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,839
to do that job for them um i think

1325
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:24,079
expectations we've got a few minutes

1326
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:26,880
left let's go quick switch to bob's

1327
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,640
slides and bob if you can be

1328
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,280
really really brief we might be able to

1329
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,799
let ingomar squeeze a word inside

1330
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,559
in a way i'd rather you yield to engine

1331
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,839
markers i've had a look at these slides

1332
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:38,319
but

1333
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,000
i'll i'll just tell people what's in

1334
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,280
these slides and they can then they can

1335
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,200
go and look at them if you can jump

1336
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,240
next slide this summarizes it all really

1337
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,520
that we're focusing on the

1338
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,359
congestion control implementation

1339
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,960
particularly faster getting up to speed

1340
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,520
which

1341
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,480
the abbreviation is guts and so faster

1342
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,280
guts

1343
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,799
and um the the other activities that

1344
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:00,000
just been talked about are going on in

1345
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,799
parallel obviously

1346
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,119
next um

1347
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,680
so there's a new draft um documenting

1348
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,240
the

1349
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,240
the prior congestion control published

1350
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,440
yesterday

1351
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,240
um some summaries there about it being

1352
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:14,960
protocol

1353
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,400
and os agnostic and you know this point

1354
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,680
about it not being the one true prague

1355
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,720
that just said next

1356
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,839
this one i think yeah just what's inside

1357
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:31,359
here's where you are that's a summary of

1358
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,799
who's helped on all the drafts and

1359
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,319
what's changed and

1360
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:37,359
um and um where we are

1361
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:39,839
and that's it

1362
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,839
and uh ingamar go for it

1363
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:49,599
uh yeah can you hear me or uh

1364
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,280
did you hear me yes yeah great

1365
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,720
i know how may i know roughly minus one

1366
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,599
minute left or

1367
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,079
no how many times minutes do you have

1368
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,839
before you cut the line

1369
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:05,200
um give yourself at least the five

1370
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,400
you're planning to take and those who

1371
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,599
are interested will stick around

1372
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,040
okay okay this is our

1373
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,359
ultimate about the master thesis is just

1374
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,960
also done by

1375
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,520
brunello roughly one year ago actually

1376
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,160
and uh

1377
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,160
it was a published and you have the link

1378
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,359
there if you want to read

1379
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:24,640
all the stuff and it's about uh

1380
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:27,680
get on or online and cloud gaming

1381
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,920
in 5g more or less and it's based on l4s

1382
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,160
and an implementation you find your own

1383
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,359
for the alpha

1384
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,520
we can skip this glossary and read it

1385
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,400
after after presentation if you like

1386
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,480
but the outline is that we use a

1387
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,760
simulation

1388
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,079
a system simulator a proprietary one

1389
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,160
that models a

1390
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,040
typical 3dpp deployment or a 3dpp

1391
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,880
standard deployment

1392
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,200
with 21 cells base stations and

1393
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,680
you have a rather narrow bandwidth and

1394
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,480
uh

1395
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,960
use a screen congestion control as a

1396
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,000
baseline for

1397
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,160
for a typical uh congested control

1398
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,440
algorithm that can run

1399
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,640
with or without and

1400
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,760
you have a variable load that's a sort

1401
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,799
of increasing

1402
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,599
intensity of users and also a number of

1403
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,720
background

1404
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,280
traffic loads that hammers the links to

1405
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,640
get more

1406
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,079
credible scenario and we run with

1407
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,000
various scheduling algorithms which

1408
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,520
means that they're settling you're sadly

1409
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,359
one user at a time in a

1410
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:35,359
in a in a five-year system well

1411
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,440
first we have a round-robin settling

1412
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,599
that is typically used for a

1413
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,680
normal mobile-back

1414
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,760
mobile broadband traffic and then you

1415
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,359
have something called called quality of

1416
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:48,799
source they give

1417
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:52,559
enhanced priority for the gaming users

1418
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,599
and you can skip the next slide

1419
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:59,680
and we use here a cube based uh

1420
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,400
look it's okay it is a how we can

1421
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,960
realize it in the 3dpp network is that

1422
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,079
we use a quality of service

1423
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,480
framework where you sort of put set up

1424
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,559
as an extra barrier actually for the

1425
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,160
alphas flows

1426
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,000
that means that you can keep the latency

1427
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,920
low or that flow and

1428
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,000
it of course it assumes that it's on the

1429
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,480
l4s traffic then you can help first mark

1430
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,200
that and for that we can use the traffic

1431
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,599
filters that are available and

1432
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,119
remap the flows that have this uh l4s uh

1433
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:35,760
other thor also is capable to that flow

1434
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,839
and you can call possibly combine it

1435
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:42,319
with the ip5 tuple if you like also

1436
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,520
and next slide

1437
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,079
okay i'm probably perhaps you need to go

1438
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,160
back to the slides

1439
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,240
here okay

1440
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,720
then we have uh what we're using is this

1441
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,640
cube based l4s marker which means that

1442
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,440
you actually

1443
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,920
you measure the queue buildup up and rsv

1444
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:02,960
layer

1445
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,280
but you mark on the pdp layer and the

1446
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,119
reason why you do that is that the

1447
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,599
ip packets on the rlc layer there are

1448
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,440
hidden by encryption so you need to

1449
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,319
actually feed

1450
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:15,760
up the marking to the pcp layer rather

1451
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,119
ip header is uh visible and essentially

1452
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,400
that is a

1453
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,280
call you can call it tail marking or

1454
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,640
feedback and

1455
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,640
forward or whatever or you call it in

1456
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,839
the ihf

1457
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:30,880
nomenclature and you have something

1458
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:32,720
typical thresholds and you go to a

1459
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,640
probability marking and the threshold

1460
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,280
the

1461
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,440
in the stimuli in the simulation studies

1462
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,599
that you have with a higher and lower

1463
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,359
threshold that are five and ten

1464
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,039
milliseconds

1465
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,599
that can depend on the what kind of

1466
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,079
numerology that you are using on is it a

1467
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,240
time division duplex or is it frequency

1468
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,480
division duplex

1469
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,720
so we can uh you probably need to tune

1470
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,319
those depending what kind of

1471
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,599
raw nectar that you're running you can

1472
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,480
skip two slides i can believe you can

1473
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,079
jump

1474
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,520
and this sort of uh shows a time trace

1475
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,559
comparison

1476
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,760
when you are using uh not for us in a

1477
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:13,680
congested network in a contestant

1478
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,880
situation where you

1479
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,960
though the bit rate needs to go down to

1480
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,119
like 30 megabits per second or even

1481
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,920
lower to avoid you build up

1482
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,839
first you have a note 10 for s and use a

1483
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,000
round robin scheduler and you see it you

1484
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,359
have a

1485
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,480
the network k2 delay spikes up to like

1486
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,359
um almost 150 milliseconds and that can

1487
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,760
and that can sort of uh seriously harm

1488
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,799
the performance

1489
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,079
for for online gaming or cloud gaming

1490
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,200
and then you have a you enable l4s you

1491
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,880
keep the same uh

1492
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,599
scheduler that is use a normal mobile

1493
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,880
broadband

1494
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,200
you can see that you reduce the bitrate

1495
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,760
a bit but on the other hand you get a

1496
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,960
much slower q delay

1497
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,920
and then you have if you have used q

1498
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,359
quality of service you can actually

1499
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,200
increase the bit rate a bit because you

1500
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,400
push back

1501
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,839
normal mobile broadband users

1502
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,880
and you still keep the same low delay

1503
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,799
that's what the what the keyos gives

1504
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,759
next slide

1505
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,599
here we look at the video frame delay

1506
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,280
and here i must say that

1507
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,680
this video friendly also accommodates

1508
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,520
that you have some

1509
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,319
capturing and uh and coding delay also

1510
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:31,599
in the soup

1511
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:33,599
that's why the minimum is 40

1512
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,039
milliseconds here

1513
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,240
what is important here is to see that

1514
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,400
without fresh marking you manage to keep

1515
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,440
the

1516
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,480
video frame delay low up to

1517
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,520
a relatively high high load in the

1518
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,960
system

1519
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,799
guess compared to those when you know

1520
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,440
not using l4s

1521
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,799
and you can probably skip

1522
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,000
the next one here

1523
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,359
and also one important okay perhaps won

1524
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,760
back

1525
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,480
yeah okay you're really really in a

1526
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,119
hurry here

1527
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,319
but okay now what the important is

1528
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,400
that what the alphas manage is to keep

1529
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,119
the the network q delay low and that is

1530
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,240
shown here

1531
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,640
that you managed to keep the network q

1532
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:21,839
build up very low

1533
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,440
and that is the main purpose

1534
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,440
the purpose of the of the l4s here

1535
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,920
and also if you you add use additional

1536
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,359
quality of storage of course you

1537
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:35,200
improve improve the performance because

1538
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:37,119
that means essentially that you can push

1539
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:37,839
back

1540
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:39,760
other users in order to keep your q

1541
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:42,480
delay budget

1542
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,240
next slide that's the shoulder

1543
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,920
transmitted rate and here it does

1544
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,520
is something that is up to discussion

1545
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,640
here is uh maybe online or offline on

1546
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,280
is that you actually trade off a bit of

1547
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,359
a throughput in order to get

1548
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,319
a lower delay and part of the reason is

1549
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:01,359
that the video

1550
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,799
encoders typically have a very varying

1551
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,079
frame sizes which have shown up in our

1552
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,359
upper right grapher and

1553
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:14,559
another one is that you have in the

1554
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,839
cellular access you have

1555
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,440
fast fading that means that the

1556
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,520
throughput tips occur on a

1557
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,319
millisecond basis so you need to have

1558
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,480
some extra headroom in order to get the

1559
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,359
q delay

1560
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,599
build up so that means that you actually

1561
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,119
push down the bitrate to be

1562
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,920
a bit but that is a trade-off that you

1563
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,720
need to do and

1564
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:36,319
there are also shortcuts here

1565
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,079
one shortcut is of course if you have a

1566
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:40,720
very

1567
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,799
strict priority scheduling you can push

1568
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,559
out all other users then you can get

1569
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:44,960
your

1570
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,200
throughput but get other problems

1571
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,200
instead

1572
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:52,400
and i believe us probably stops there

1573
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,480
unless they're all questions and we're

1574
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,839
running out of time and

1575
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,160
think about where do you where do we get

1576
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,319
the full details of this

1577
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:06,000
we've uploaded the sides in the slide

1578
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,359
deck is the thesis available

1579
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,599
yes can you repeat that i didn't take

1580
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:12,720
quite

1581
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,960
where do we get more details of what

1582
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,158
you've just presented

1583
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,000
where can we find well yeah you will

1584
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,319
find it in the multi-thesis presentation

1585
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:20,799
if you

1586
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:22,880
in the on the link on the first page

1587
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,479
here

1588
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,198
yeah thank you

1589
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:34,640
it's 116 pages let me go

1590
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,158
carefully copy that link into

1591
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:40,319
the minute since i can do the cut and

1592
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,920
paste

1593
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,719
okay great

1594
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,759
and thanks everyone who presented thanks

1595
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:50,479
for keeping

1596
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:53,040
time we we had quite a lot of stuff

1597
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,839
going on in tsvwg this time round

1598
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:57,279
and it was good to have lots of

1599
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,198
participants

1600
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,439
we have a number of adoption and last

1601
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,198
calls coming up on the list please

1602
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,000
look out for them and we do look forward

1603
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,920
to seeing you in other ietf meetings on

1604
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,000
the next tsvwg meeting

1605
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,560
and we've clearly demonstrated that we

1606
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,640
need to go back to asking for at least

1607
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,439
four hours

1608
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,839
in the future three hours is not enough

1609
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:23,198
this time sorry about that

1610
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:35,839
was of you anything finally to say

1611
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,080
excellent okay um if you're going to uh

1612
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,679
prepare presentations for the next

1613
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:50,399
meetings

1614
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,238
please do stick by the deadlines and

1615
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:53,759
send them in advance

1616
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:55,920
uh last minute presentations are really

1617
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,920
challenging in agenda planning

1618
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,760
but apart from that we just wish you the

1619
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,679
best and um

1620
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:04,719
keep talking on the list

1621
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:12,719
thank you very much everybody
