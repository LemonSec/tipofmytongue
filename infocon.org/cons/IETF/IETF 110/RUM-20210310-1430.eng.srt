notes they don't have to be

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
extra thorough they don't have to be

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,960
blow by blow

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
they mostly needed to capture decisions

32
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,159

yes if you if well uh

111
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,400
you can just speak up given the small

112
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,680
number of people in the

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,960
room i'm not really worried okay

114
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,639
um the only thing that i just wanted to

115
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
ask about the agenda

116
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,720
um i believe we would like to

117
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,280
you know talk about maybe some of the

118
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
open issues that we had talked about

119
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
on the email that maybe haven't been

120
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,400
resolved

121
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,960
and and perhaps bring up another couple

122
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
i guess your agenda is allowing for that

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
right

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
correct other we i have a number of

125
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,120
items that i think have not been

126
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,919
resolved

127
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,400
that i'm gonna gonna talk about and

128
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,440
anyone

um there has been an ongoing discussion

172
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
if oauth has a role here

173
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,479
and we still have that open

174
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,120
there are a bunch of other small issues

175
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,639
that paul raised in an email that i

176
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
haven't yet responded to but i think

177
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
i can satisfy him with uh

178
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,319
minor text changes don't think there's

179
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,720
any substantive issues

180
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
um i think we have

181
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,839
dealt with the other issues that have

182
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,440
been raised on the list but

183
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
i may have missed something and i'm

184
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
again this will go

185
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,760
fairly quickly and so i think we'll have

186
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
lots of time to bring up other issues

187
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,040
and and so i'm i'm anticipating that

188
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,800
i've probably forgotten something or

189
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,959
not realized someone doesn't think that

190
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,800
something i think is closed

191
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
or settled is is settled and so we'll

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,200
we'll definitely have

193
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
plenty of time after this to

194
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,080
talk about things that aren't on that

195
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,399
list

196
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
um okay so

197
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,839
um outbound has

198
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,040
is is basically the issues that are

199
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,440
still around have to do with

200
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,600
handling multiple proxies both on

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
inbound and outbound

202
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,240
um and uh the the the the current

203
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,399
question on the table i believe is

204
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,160
what does multiple outbound proxies in

205
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,399
the configuration mean

206
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,800
and then there's a there's a follow-on

207
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
for that which is

208
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,000
there's text in there that says um

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,959
devices should only accept uh incoming

210
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,399
calls from

211
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,279
uh entities they they're provisioned

212
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,640
with

213
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,959
and then how does that interact with

214
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,399
outbound

215
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,920
um and uh

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
so that that whole issue is still kind

217
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,360
of uh

218
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,720
running around the the direction i

219
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
think we're going is what paul hinted at

220
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,279
which was outbound proxies if there are

221
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,920
multiple outbound proxies

222
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,720
inbounds are only allowed from those and

223
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
any of them can be

224
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,600
you know calls can go to any of the

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,519
outbounds any any

226
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,720
any of those can be used for inbounds

227
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
um but i need to first of all does that

228
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,720
right is that what people want to do

229
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,800
um and and then i'll need to

230
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,079
modify the text to say that um

231
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,160
so that if you have multiple outbound

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
proxies

233
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,480
in inbounds are allowed from any of them

234
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
outbounds must go to any of them

235
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,800
um and presumably well let me stop there

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,279
and

237
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,560
and ask if there's comments on on

238
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,079
that notion of basically going which

239
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,200
where um uh

240
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,360
paul hinted which is multiple outbound

241
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
proxies means calls can go to any of

242
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,760
them

243
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
but also any inbounds can go to any of

244
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,479
them which is what the outbound rfc says

245
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,279
it was my issue so let me try to clarify

246
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,240
a little bit

247
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,360
sure um we have the we have the

248
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,839
configuration of

249
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
quote outbound proxies yeah specified

250
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
uh we also have listed

251
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,760
that support of the outbound

252
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
functionality i forget the

253
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
the rfc number right now but yes

254
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,480
it it's the specific functionality um

255
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
is optional for the provider correct

256
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,680
not optional for the for the room um

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,760
so i think if

258
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,120
if if the provider is using outbound

259
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,200
then it's all clear because

260
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,839
the rfc for outbound specifies what

261
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,279
multiple proxies are

262
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,320
what they do and it's also clear you

263
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,440
know where you're in

264
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,600
incoming messages come from because it's

265
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,040
all about connection reuse

266
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,240
and and so everything is fine

267
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
in that case the question arises

268
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,959
if the provider is not supporting and

269
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,519
using outbound

270
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,720
functionality we've still got

271
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,440
proxies that can be configured i think

272
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,839
they're

273
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,760
optional in total aren't they correct

274
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,720
the specification of proxies is optional

275
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,160
in the config file

276
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,880
yeah so

277
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,360
so there's there's a couple questions

278
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
one if there are no proxies configured

279
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,360
yeah how do you handle it right yeah

280
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,320
well then

281
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,200
how to connect is is is still well

282
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,320
well-defined

283
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
you know as far as sip is concerned

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,839
that's not that's not an issue

285
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,600
um but how

286
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
or if you would restrict incoming calls

287
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,720
isn't well defined at all right

288
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
and you know

289
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,560
i i don't think there's anything we can

290
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
do in that case

291
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,360
well let's let's why don't we why don't

292
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
we just sort of stop and see whether

293
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
this is really what we want to do that

294
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,959
is

295
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,079
it your art you're suggesting

296
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,760
i think that if you specify

297
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,360
multiple proxies in the config you must

298
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,000
support

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
outbound as a provider because we don't

300
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,079
know

301
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,399
what multiple outbound proxies would

302
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,199
mean in any other circumstance

303
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,880
is that that what you're proposing yeah

304
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,639
that's one okay so let's let's try let's

305
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,120
just

306
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,959
try that do do other participants think

307
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,240
that that's reasonable i mean that

308
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,720
doesn't

309
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
it doesn't say you have to support

310
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
outbound unless it says you only have to

311
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,800
support outbound

312
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
as a provider if you specify more than

313
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,880
one proxy on the outbound configuration

314
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,240
and you know it it is

315
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
it's more common to have only one right

316
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,399
that that's the more common

317
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,720
uh circumstance but multiple for

318
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
redundant renunciate purposes and other

319
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,600
purposes

320
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,920
is often helpful but let's just say

321
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,680
let's just ask a question if if we

322
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,160
proposed it that way if we said

323
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
if you specify more than one proc

324
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,600
outbound proxy

325
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,880
in the configuration that means you must

326
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
support

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,959
the outbound rfc and then we know what

328
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,320
multiple outbound proxies

329
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,199
mean is that a reasonable is that a

330
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,800
reasonable restriction

331
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,720
anyone anyone think that's a bad idea

332
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
gonna speak up if you think it's a bad

333
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,839
idea especially

334
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,880
you right you were actually confusing

335
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,639
outbound and outbound here

336
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,920
right the alpine rc is

337
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,800
a different thing than outbound proxies

338
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
i'm trying to trying to differentiate

339
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,320
i'm trying to say

340
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
yes i'm trying to say all right so the

341
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,920
configuration

342
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,959
lets you specify one or more outbound

343
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,279
proxies

344
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,480
it and and and it says if you've got an

345
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,199
outbound proxy configured then all

346
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,160
outbound calls

347
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
go to that proxy what does it mean

348
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,440
if you have more than one outbound proxy

349
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,040
configured and normally

350
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
you configure a dns name and that dns

351
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,360
navigates there's a re-records that can

352
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
have multiple

353
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,680
yes you can do this yeah is a completely

354
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,959
different package

355
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,320
that means that you have two open tcp

356
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,759
flows to two different

357
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,040
ingress proxies so alpha or c

358
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
is a whole different thing than outbound

359
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,800
proxies

360
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,240
so if you're aware of that i'm fine yes

361
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,759
okay uh gene eugene

362
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,839
so just just a um question about

363
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,199
the outbound proxy i mean i i haven't

364
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,639
read the outbound

365
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,600
rfc so i'm not real familiar or i'm not

366
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,440
familiar at all with that but

367
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,199
when you're talking about outbound proxy

368
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,720
are we just talking about where are the

369
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,480
endpoints registering

370
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
and not registering no no it's it's

371
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
where calls are get sent

372
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,839
if you place a call where does the call

373
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
go

374
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,160
yeah i apologize yes you're correct it

375
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,399
is registration too

376
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,399
it's just a way of overriding if you

377
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,880
have an

378
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,680
address of record in example.com but you

379
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,320
want to

380
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,839
all seek messages to go to

381
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,039
inbound.example.com dns

382
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,160
you configure an outbound uri to do that

383
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
to override and not

384
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,799
use the address of record domain

385
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
this is a simple configuration thing and

386
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,880
you one shouldn't mix that with the

387
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,799
outbound error of c because the alpha of

388
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,679
c is also

389
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,160
different set of problems in different

390
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
ways

391
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,039
i i think what paul

392
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,320
proposes is reasonable though

393
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,919
you there is a use for multiple outbound

394
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,120
proxy

395
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,159
uris in the outbound rfc

396
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
and you can configure that

397
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,880
but that implies that you support the

398
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,799
outbound rfc

399
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,960
if you only put one uri

400
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,799
you if you only configure one outbound

401
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,080
proxy then

402
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
you don't have to support outbound the

403
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
outbound rfc

404
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,360
and we know what that means i mean you

405
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,600
surely can have multiple outbound

406
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,400
proxies configured without bothering at

407
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,320
all without bond rfcs

408
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
and what does that mean what what what

409
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,480
does that imply

410
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
on either dns survey failover or you

411
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
select one

412
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,919
i mean it's an implementation specific

413
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,440
thing

414
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
right well well we're trying to make

415
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,480
sure that we

416
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,039
have interoperable implementation so we

417
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,880
have to specify

418
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
what the roo device assumes if the

419
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,000
provider configures more than one

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,280
um outbound proxy and

421
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,960
doesn't support out the outbound rfc

422
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
well you you need to start looking at

423
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
dns srv and say if you don't use

424
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,080
srv and you configure multiple ones you

425
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,520
need a priority setting or

426
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,000
just allowing your own device to use a

427
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,880
random

428
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,400
setup and pick any one right i mean we

429
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,640
could define it that way

430
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,760
but i don't see any value in doing that

431
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,600
i mean if that's what you want you can

432
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,880
just configure one

433
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
and then use dns to have multiple

434
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
servers for it

435
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
and you've got all the mechanisms for

436
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
priority and

437
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
all that stuff there yeah

438
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,720
so you're saying that the outbound the

439
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
configured outbound

440
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,400
has to be treated as any other cpri

441
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
so we go to dns resolution first and

442
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
unless we have dns resolution it's a

443
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,000
host name

444
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,080
and then you have a single outbound

445
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,400
server but if you have dns you you'll

446
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,840
get the benefits of failover and load

447
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
balancing

448
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,640
well i i think we're tying ourselves in

449
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,280
not

450
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,720
by terminology by because we're using

451
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,640
outbound in two ways

452
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,320
maybe we should at least just start

453
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,520
talking about rfc 5626

454
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,039
when we want to talk about that

455
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,760
functionality

456
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,880
uh to distinguish it from the word

457
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,240
outbound used for other purposes

458
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
yeah i mean you either talk about up on

459
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,600
proxy

460
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,840
right or the the failover mechanism

461
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,679
that we have in the sip outbound

462
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,919
standard which means that you actually

463
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,720
have two

464
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
concurrent registrations for the same

465
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,799
contact

466
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,799
and the service provider then have to do

467
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,159
failover

468
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,440
between those different reg ids for the

469
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,880
same contact

470
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,919
which very few carriers have and we have

471
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,720
never been able to test that cpit that

472
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,159
it works properly

473
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,880
the only practical use of the zip up on

474
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
our crc today

475
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,280
is in c power web sockets that is

476
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
actually used but only with one

477
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
registration

478
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,520
but since the contact is useless the reg

479
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,080
id

480
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,919
is the only thing we have to be able to

481
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,480
call back

482
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,240
well does that suggest that we just get

483
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
rid of the outbound rfc

484
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,159
i mean if nobody implements it nobody

485
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,840
implements it i'm not interested but if

486
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,159
if

487
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,720
if it's useful i think it's useful

488
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
i i i'm not sure i i thought it w

489
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,960
it had more value than you're implying

490
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,640
it does

491
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,200
i think we do use it another cool way to

492
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,080
handle

493
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
that than that solution but the

494
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
implementation rate is

495
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,600
almost zero in

496
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,280
my part of the world i don't know about

497
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,000
you paul if you've seen it

498
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,240
i i i don't have any visibility to uh

499
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
no the real world we implemented a

500
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,760
server-side

501
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,159
part of it in camarillo and that took a

502
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,520
lot of work

503
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,600
but we've never been able to test it at

504
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,199
any secret or any other place

505
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
i think maybe we should just drop it

506
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,520
then

507
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,200
and then just allow one outbound

508
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,799
configuration

509
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,000
you know only have one proxy you can use

510
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,799
dns

511
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,200
to handle more than one physical server

512
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
for redundancy purposes

513
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,720
before we do before we get that far

514
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,159
there's really two two functionalities

515
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,240
in rfc 5626 one is the redundant

516
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,200
registration

517
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,880
failover mechanism yeah but

518
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,240
the other is connection reuse right yeah

519
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,280
that's pretty cool

520
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,320
yeah you're right um

521
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,440
and it's really

522
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,200
as far as i know the only well

523
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,480
specified mechanism for connection reuse

524
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,919
precip for devices

525
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,600
that don't don't have their own

526
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,200
you know domain name right

527
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,840
which of these wouldn't

528
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
and now especially if you want to sip

529
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,320
over tcp

530
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,679
uh over nat or firewalls uh sip outbound

531
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,840
is the only way to get

532
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,640
back in an rc compliant

533
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,760
way right in camellia we

534
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,039
actually found find the out the incoming

535
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,480
tcp connection

536
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,080
and don't give a damn and we send it out

537
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,039
it also solves a lot of rfc issues with

538
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,679
tls

539
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,679
right so you don't have to have client

540
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,919
certificates

541
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,400
or service certificates on client phones

542
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,159
well i i g that sounds good um

543
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,679
i i my my own experiences in weird

544
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,480
circumstances the 911 environment where

545
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,600
things like connection

546
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,200
redundancy and things like that are much

547
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,720
more important so

548
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,200
but they're unusual so my experience is

549
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,000
probably not

550
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,240
relevant to what for this application

551
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,480
but it the connection reuse and

552
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
fostering good tcp connections and not

553
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,760
having to

554
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,720
hack around with nat traversal and you

555
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,520
know

556
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,760
that all that's really good stuff and if

557
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,200
we can keep that i

558
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,440
i think that would be worthwhile then we

559
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,840
can copy a lot of the text from the

560
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,240
rc or simple web sockets which

561
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,000
implements kind of

562
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,840
that part of outbound as paul mentioned

563
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,960
yeah i usually call it half outbound

564
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,600
because

565
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,679
it doesn't require anything special in

566
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,720
the proxy just

567
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,640
finding the incoming connection and use

568
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,240
that route bomb

569
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,120
seek messages

570
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
i mean first let's take a crack if i

571
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,720
recall correctly

572
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,039
i mean the connection reuse is what

573
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,840
drove

574
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,600
the development of rfc 5620 correct

575
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,279
correct it did it did um and that by the

576
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:05,600
way

577
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,200
is very tightly tied to this

578
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,360
requirement we have in the document to

579
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,799
only receive

580
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,120
requests from from the thing you want

581
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,159
yeah and of course it's you know that's

582
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,000
how you identify it i i

583
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,520
i don't know any any reliable way

584
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,200
to require the you know to restrict who

585
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,520
you

586
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,880
who who you receive calls from

587
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,400
um in the absence of outbound

588
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,840
here 56-26 uh

589
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,720
yeah and i i don't want to have devices

590
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,120
have to accept calls from anybody that

591
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,000
that to me

592
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,320
that's a really bad security situation

593
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,960
well like i say i i i'm willing to hear

594
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
but i don't know of

595
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,880
of any way

596
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,480
any way that that that a root could do

597
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,200
that reliably other than with 5626

598
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,000
all right so can we take this as a as a

599
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,120
working proposal

600
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,960
subject to how the words come out and

601
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,120
what i will try

602
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,320
to work with you all and craft words

603
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,720
that

604
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,000
only require the connection to reuse

605
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,240
part of outbound rc

606
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,520
and not the registration

607
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,880
pieces yeah and please

608
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,159
go back to the zip over web sockets rfc

609
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,720
to find very good examples on how to do

610
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,480
that in the standard how to do that

611
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,760
okay i'll do that i think ali might have

612
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,520
something to offer here because

613
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,960
my recollection is that one of the big

614
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,640
issues with rfc 5626

615
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,000
is for mobile devices it's a power

616
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
sucker yeah yeah

617
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,640
keeping two two tls connections

618
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,960
absolutely i mean even keeping one isn't

619
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,679
it yeah

620
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,039
yeah because carrier closest

621
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,480
long-running tcp sections

622
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,279
mobile devices is a whole different

623
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,080
problem area

624
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,279
we fully expected that this ruth back to

625
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,159
be implemented

626
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,200
on mobile devices and so

627
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,520
we better not have we might not better

628
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,440
not have a requirement for something

629
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
that's infeasible to use on mobile

630
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,039
devices

631
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,399
hey this is this is isaac on that point

632
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,679
that that's definitely one of the

633
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:50,880
concerns we had

634
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120
is that mobile devices

635
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,120
they all they all require some type of

636
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
push notification now

637
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,880
to do an inbound call and we don't

638
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,200
we don't have anything for that so i

639
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,320
don't know if we

640
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,360
assume we want inbound calls right

641
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,120
yeah i would expect that

642
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,799
so it's hard to understand how this

643
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,039
would even be usable by anybody without

644
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,000
some mechanism for mobile

645
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,760
yeah but when you get the push

646
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,840
notification you open at least a piece

647
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,440
of it inwards

648
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,240
and you get the invite over that so

649
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,399
we're still using outbound but we don't

650
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,120
have yeah

651
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,080
well no but if you're not already if

652
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,159
you're not already registered you need

653
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:36,799
some

654
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,159
you need some kind of a redirect or

655
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:40,640
something

656
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,600
so that once the client wakes up and and

657
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,880
also how does it get the push

658
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,799
notification in the first place right

659
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,760
you need

660
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
you need something like a device token

661
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,240
to identify the device

662
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
there is a step bar there is an rfc on

663
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,000
push notification just yep maybe it

664
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,840
needs to be

665
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,399
yes somewhere uh yeah i i

666
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,039
there there is um i'll put a reference

667
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:03,440
on the

668
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,840
on the list unless somebody want to look

669
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,440
it up put it on the thing but

670
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,679
uh that particular issue uh

671
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,039
has been uh has been dealt with

672
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,080
for exactly the reason you raised

673
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,559
that multiple people have had exactly

674
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,320
that problem and there is an rfc that

675
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,840
deals with it

676
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,120
okay i know my experience different

677
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,200
providers have solved that in different

678
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,559
ways

679
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,600
if there's a good rfc or standard that

680
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
that we should follow then yeah we need

681
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,240
to reference that

682
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,600
that's the way that we're all going to

683
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,360
do it that that's

684
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,279
that's a very good point i'm surprised

685
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,120
we didn't think of it before

686
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,159
um but we we probably need to

687
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,440
to to bring that in yeah

688
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,279
i haven't followed that closely but like

689
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,320
i mean i i i've seen the 3gpp people

690
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,240
talking about it a lot so i suspect

691
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,120
maybe they've got it

692
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
well i mean basically any mobile device

693
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,840
for any any asynchronous any incoming

694
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,760
anything the only way to wake the app up

695
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,080
is with a push notification

696
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,399
um so if you're going to send it a call

697
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,760
the only way you're going to get the app

698
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,559
to get it

699
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,039
if it's asynchronous is is with push

700
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,200
but you still need zip outbound to be

701
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
able to place

702
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,840
the outbound invite

703
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
on the same connection that the phone

704
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,080
sets up inbound for registering

705
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,520
when it wakes up so it does it doesn't

706
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,720
conflict with that

707
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,360
another problem with the outbound rc

708
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,279
that we need to mention is that it

709
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,679
implements a pre-forking for that was

710
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,120
complicated for many simple

711
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,799
implementations

712
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,919
that you have a fork

713
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,159
between the different regis for the same

714
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,159
contact and then you handle

715
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,840
the next contact in parallel or in syria

716
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,720
uh we had to fight quite a lot today get

717
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
that working properly in camellia and i

718
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,519
wish that

719
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,039
before i retired that i actually

720
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,360
succeeded in testing this but that's the

721
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,080
registration

722
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,760
piece right that's the part we said we

723
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
weren't going to try to get

724
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,720
redundancy

725
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,519
having multiple links with multiple reg

726
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,640
ids for the same registration

727
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,360
that was kind of complex yeah history

728
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,120
sorry

729
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,600
okay so ali let me let me ask a

730
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,039
clarifying question

731
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,600
are you saying that that people are

732
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,640
using

733
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,240
the push features so so they're not

734
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,080
they're not registered all the time

735
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,159
they're waiting until they get the push

736
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,399
and then they then they register using

737
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,158
rfc 5626

738
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,760
or or that's one things

739
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,559
but we implemented in many places push

740
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,519
notifications

741
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,640
and camilo what we best basically have

742
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,080
to do is a way to

743
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,320
freeze the sip transaction while the

744
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,840
push is taking place

745
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,440
and we're waiting for an incoming

746
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,039
registration when we have an income

747
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,320
administration

748
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,880
we're forwarding white quickly as quick

749
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,440
as possible

750
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
there does not need to be a connection

751
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,360
between registration

752
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,240
and and that push notification you you

753
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:28,640
can

754
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,240
you can do regular registration uh

755
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,399
without it but but you have to make sure

756
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,880
that the client is doing refreshing and

757
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
all that stuff yes

758
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,399
an authentication authenticated

759
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,919
connection to the phone

760
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,000
and that's usually a registration that

761
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,519
comes in right

762
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,000
i think mobile mobile the app doesn't

763
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,960
get woken up

764
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,080
unless there's a call or user activates

765
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,600
the app right so there's

766
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,399
yeah there's no refresh and this is all

767
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,399
fairly recent in the last few years i

768
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:00,799
mean

769
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,679
yes that's right apple used to allow you

770
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,440
to run the app in the background and

771
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,679
stay registered

772
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,000
and then they did they allowed the voip

773
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,720
connection

774
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,880
which allowed you to wake the up gap up

775
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,679
with the tcp connection

776
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,360
but more recently they've completely

777
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
shut that down the app cannot run at all

778
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,840
unless it gets a push yeah and

779
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,279
yeah yeah yeah neither the carrier or

780
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:27,760
the

781
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,320
phone manufacturer carriers also close

782
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,760
connections in

783
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,720
various ways with middle boxes all right

784
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,159
let's let's

785
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,000
unless somebody has some new aspect of

786
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,440
this they want to discuss

787
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,679
i think i know how to go forward

788
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,519
i may call on folks for help in

789
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,279
reviewing texts to make sure that i'm

790
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,440
doing something but i think i know what

791
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,880
we're going to do

792
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,640
um uh and

793
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,360
so i'd like to move on so we have time

794
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,720
for other issues

795
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,880
at the end if that's if that's okay

796
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,880
all right oauth um we've had this has

797
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,639
been discussed several times we haven't

798
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,399
got any text

799
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,760
um we need to decide if we're supporting

800
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
oauth and if so for what

801
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,918
um we could support oauth for

802
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,679
authentication for the configuration

803
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,639
info

804
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,000
we could support oauth for

805
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,679
authentication for sip or we could do

806
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,040
both

807
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,679
and if we do have a role for oauth is

808
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,079
that

809
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,918
instead of or in addition to username

810
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,639
password for any of those possibilities

811
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,079
so i'd like to settle this um it's been

812
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,599
discussed on and off and i you know i

813
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,960
i don't care i like it but i also know

814
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,839
it hasn't been implemented very widely

815
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,040
um

816
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,520
now that's less true of any http based

817
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,199
thing than in the sit-based thing but

818
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,399
still

819
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,440
what do people want to do

820
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,440
hey this is always maybe if you could

821
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,680
help me understand at least what we were

822
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,720
thinking with oauth would it be

823
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,560
you know the way oauth normally works

824
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
right is i sign up for an account and it

825
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,839
says oh you can use

826
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,560
you can choose something else to log in

827
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,079
facebook google

828
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,599
apple whatever would it be like that

829
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,000
where then every provider would have to

830
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,760
provide their own oauth service slash

831
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,280
server

832
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,720
that's the only way i think it could

833
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,520
work because yeah yeah

834
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,280
that there would somehow be a single

835
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,200
oauth

836
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,880
that would somehow know how to go to

837
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,560
passwords and username

838
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,440
and it seems like it's not no no no it

839
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,920
would be

840
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,599
it would be every provider provides

841
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,960
their own

842
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,000
um it would be an alternative to

843
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
having configured username passwords

844
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
that are used in you know directly with

845
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,079
register and

846
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,760
with um any any of the authentication

847
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,720
mechanisms

848
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,599
that you use with with with sip or with

849
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,839
the configuration service

850
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,280
um yeah the the username password is

851
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,240
there

852
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,400
i do remind you that oauth ultimately

853
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
uses a username password it's just that

854
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,320
there's been tokens and

855
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,280
tokens can that be shared and used and

856
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,400
can be

857
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
minted and then used subsequently and

858
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,359
things like that so

859
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,560
what do you want to do in addition in

860
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,040
addition oauth can use

861
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,599
i mean multi-factor login you can have

862
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,960
tokens you can have

863
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
we don't we don't limit what author it

864
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,359
doesn't have to be username password

865
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,640
could be this client so i guess that's a

866
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,880
that's a good point it lets you do other

867
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,000
ways

868
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,720
tokens yeah especially and certainly and

869
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
if we say oh

870
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,640
we we let someone else decide that part

871
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,880
what we get out what is what you said

872
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,800
the tokens right

873
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,680
yeah we get an old token an identity

874
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,760
token if it's open id connect

875
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,400
and uh uh what's the name of the third

876
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,359
one

877
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,720
uh a refresh token but the thing is

878
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,880
uh sip has been around for a very long

879
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,640
time when zip was created

880
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,040
uh the best authentication we had was

881
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,160
http

882
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,320
basic digest auth with md5 hash method

883
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,040
we're now in 2021 and we're setting new

884
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,160
standards

885
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,800
md5 is considered broken since a long

886
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,000
time

887
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,680
in the sip standards uh we have

888
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,720
two different options at least we have

889
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,000
one rc that have replaced md5

890
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,119
with stronger hash algorithms right that

891
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:39,760
will

892
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,079
possibly die in ten years or five years

893
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,280
or whatever depending on cpu and

894
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,640
other things uh we also have

895
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,040
uh first document that i think is

896
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,040
not not fully done but that's

897
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,320
probably just me that explains how to

898
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,599
take

899
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,160
these kind of tokens in a sip world and

900
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,598
use them for authentication

901
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and i think leaving md5

902
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,200
is important for a new standard with

903
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,560
the importance we have these calls are

904
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,400
important and need all kind of

905
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,560
protection they need

906
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,880
can have oauth adds complexity

907
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,040
it's easier for people with web

908
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,960
experience to handle

909
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,119
it's harder for people with zip

910
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,800
experience to handle because it's a

911
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,880
crazy monster that doesn't look like

912
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,520
md5

913
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,800
but it it gives us a lot more

914
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,040
possibilities

915
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,520
so you authenticate somewhere else in a

916
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,880
ui

917
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
uh there are ways to do that this

918
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,240
without uis with your

919
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,320
tokens of some kind or other things but

920
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,520
the result is we

921
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,040
get tokens that the sip server verifies

922
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,960
with an identity server that they're

923
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,560
valid

924
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,480
and if we have trust between the auth

925
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,520
idp and the sip server we're all ready

926
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,920
to go

927
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,480
s is isaac so i think

928
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,320
my understanding though is that so for

929
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,079
olaf to really work you need a web

930
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,400
browser right

931
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,640
now there are standards for iot

932
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,920
without any user interfaces at all

933
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,839
and uh there are many different setups

934
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,040
but the most common one is uh like you

935
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,359
said facebook login or google login but

936
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,400
that that's just one way of using it

937
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
but how do i how do i know i'm really

938
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,079
connected to google

939
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,839
i i thought that i thought the way it

940
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,680
worked is i can see the certificate in

941
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,880
my browser

942
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,599
i can see i've got a green lock i can

943
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,240
see i'm connected to google.com and i

944
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,400
know i'm not sending my

945
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,640
password to brian rosen's man in the

946
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,440
middle server

947
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,319
well now you're opening up a whole long

948
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,400
discussion about the web of trust and we

949
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
can discuss that for hours

950
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,680
it won't help this working group

951
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,720
but uh skip facebook and google again

952
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,280
and say

953
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,040
like brian said earlier and each

954
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,359
each

955
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,280
all right that's how it works i trust

956
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,520
google i trust that google is

957
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,359
not going to compromise my password

958
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,520
so i that i mean that's kind of big the

959
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
whole basis right i know i'm talking to

960
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,319
google

961
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,760
i trust google i give them my password

962
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,680
all right so so

963
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,119
i trust i trust sorensen as a brs

964
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,000
provider

965
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,079
i can see and verify that i'm really

966
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,040
talking

967
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,560
to their server um

968
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,800
so we can go on this forever

969
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,280
but i think so i think olaf is a nice

970
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,079
option

971
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,480
but if you were going to say something

972
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,720
like well all the providers

973
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,800
now have to implement an oauth server

974
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,480
that's going to open a whole can of

975
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,319
worms like we're like we're just

976
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,200
starting to touch the surface of

977
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,119
of things that would have to be solved

978
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,359
as far as how that would be done

979
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,040
from the roo in a way that would ensure

980
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,359
that the pat user's password is not

981
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,440
compromised

982
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,880
so i i hear in that that you might be

983
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,599
okay

984
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,800
with in addition to but you're not uh

985
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,720
in uh in favor of instead of

986
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,440
existing authentication that that

987
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,560
yeah i think yeah it would put too much

988
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,359
of a burden

989
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,280
and there would there there are just a

990
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,200
bunch of things we'd have to solve

991
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,359
if we were going to make it the only

992
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,760
option or the required option

993
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,359
yes so it's optional okay

994
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,920
but not as the only required method

995
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,160
right

996
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,280
okay i think the first decision is

997
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,480
whether or not we

998
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,640
recommend md5 and i would say not

999
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
and then we have the option of using the

1000
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,240
stronger authentication

1001
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,040
in uh i don't remember darcy maybe paul

1002
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,520
yeah yeah

1003
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,599
yeah uh with ssh 256 or 512 right

1004
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,640
okay so that's a separate issue i'll i'm

1005
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,040
gonna

1006
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,560
i just want to push that off just for a

1007
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,280
second and just stay on oauth just just

1008
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,720
for now ollie

1009
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,040
okay

1010
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,760
what uh in addition to

1011
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,400
is that well let me let me ask this

1012
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,839
you've been very vocal that you think

1013
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:51,119
it's the right thing to do is there's

1014
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,480
someone else

1015
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,000
on the call and i will we will bring

1016
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
this to the list so this is not the

1017
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,599
definitive word but if there's someone

1018
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,000
else in the meeting who believes

1019
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
that it is appropriate to require every

1020
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,160
implementation

1021
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,720
of the rue device to support oauth as an

1022
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,760
alternative

1023
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
authentication mechanism instead of the

1024
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,800
existing

1025
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,920
sip mechanisms and presumably for the

1026
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,560
config info the http mechanisms

1027
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,560
is that is there is there someone else

1028
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,839
besides ollie

1029
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,920
who thinks we ought to have that as at

1030
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,640
least an option

1031
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,560
brian there's a little muddle here i

1032
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,160
think maybe is whether we're requiring

1033
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,599
this on the roof or we're

1034
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,119
requiring it on the provider i think the

1035
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,440
way would it would have to be is

1036
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,800
a mandatory at the device and optional

1037
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,880
at the provider

1038
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,520
yes thank you for that clarification

1039
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,920
well so i'm now looking is there someone

1040
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,640
else who thinks that that's a reasonable

1041
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,319
that that's what they want to do they

1042
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,560
want to have oauth

1043
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,880
implemented on all devices and optional

1044
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,720
at the provider to use

1045
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,560
with the existing sip and http

1046
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
mechanisms

1047
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,040
mandatory you know basically both ways

1048
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,160
right you know you can

1049
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,920
you can choose to use only oauth you can

1050
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,760
choose to use only

1051
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,200
username password is there a

1052
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,960
implement at this point i'm sorry

1053
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,640
the definition for oath for sip at this

1054
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,560
point i was googling it and i found

1055
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,920
now it's an individual never went

1056
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,640
yeah there's a draft there isn't uh

1057
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,920
there's an rc

1058
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,720
there's definitely an rc uh

1059
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,880
yeah i was surprised when you reached

1060
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,720
overseas status that's why i know it

1061
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:45,920
are you aware of it being implemented

1062
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,240
anywhere

1063
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,000
uh i haven't seen any implementations

1064
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,839
uh like i said earlier uh because

1065
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,480
no customers require it but uh don't

1066
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,920
find it too hard to make

1067
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,960
implementations of it

1068
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,680
so it just seems to me that there's no

1069
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,400
one else

1070
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,400
on the call and again we will bring this

1071
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,920
to the list

1072
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,359
um that supports it and although i

1073
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,400
i like it i think it's a great idea

1074
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,119
i don't see anyone saying they want to

1075
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,160
you know they want to be forced to

1076
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,560
implement it on the ruse side

1077
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,599
um and unless there's more than you who

1078
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,599
wants it

1079
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,680
you know i think we're in the rough

1080
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,880
consensus

1081
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,480
saying we don't but i again i'm

1082
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,440
i'm inclined to allow it but i don't

1083
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,119
want to do that unless there's

1084
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,720
somebody who thinks it's worth doing

1085
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,640
besides you and

1086
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,520
because it's it's work right the the at

1087
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,160
least the

1088
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,400
device implementer has to go and do all

1089
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,280
the work

1090
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,280
and um comments please

1091
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,160
if you don't do a wall please don't

1092
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,800
accept

1093
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,960
all right okay so so now that's that's

1094
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,400
i i think we've settled the oauth issue

1095
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,319
i want to again i'm going to go to the

1096
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,680
list on this

1097
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,880
um but the other issue you raised

1098
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,000
is an important one and and i i

1099
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,280
hope um that the folks on the call will

1100
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,560
will speak up but um as

1101
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,839
if you know anything about crypto md5

1102
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,880
is the is an algorithm that has been

1103
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,599
broken it's

1104
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,640
it's just too easy to crack

1105
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,240
um and up to i

1106
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,680
can't remember the number but there's a

1107
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,920
relatively recent rc

1108
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,680
that substitutes sha 256 for

1109
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,839
md5 in basic in in

1110
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,079
in authentication for sip yeah and

1111
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,440
digest

1112
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,079
um i would like to require that

1113
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,560
i don't think we should support md5

1114
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,759
what do other people think

1115
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,520
silence isaac thank you for speaking up

1116
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,720
gene think about this one

1117
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,280
i'm checking with the team but i think

1118
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,720
we actually we currently use

1119
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,559
md5 you probably do

1120
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,880
and you're insecure by a lot

1121
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,640
well would you would you research that

1122
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,040
it's really not good to be supporting

1123
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,440
md5 in anything these days

1124
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,559
it's not quite as bad in

1125
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,920
in a phone than it is in other things

1126
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,319
but it is crackable it's pretty easy to

1127
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,680
break in

1128
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,720
and i would rather not

1129
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,520
support it it really is in a long time

1130
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,280
since md5 was insecure

1131
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,839
and as i understand it 8760 is basically

1132
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,599
just drop in the new algorithm and

1133
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,280
you're done correct it's just dropping

1134
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,599
shot to 56. there's no difference

1135
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,119
other than that you can literally

1136
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,599
substitute so we want to be more

1137
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,800
successful

1138
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,760
i'm sorry i'm open to making things more

1139
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,440
secure i just need to understand what

1140
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,119
that transition would look like

1141
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,960
okay um we'll get a

1142
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,720
is that it also implements a negotiation

1143
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,079
method

1144
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
that can lead to uh interesting

1145
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,599
downgrading attacks

1146
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,680
uh it opens up not for a single hash

1147
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,520
algorithm but for multiple

1148
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,640
and a negotiation that is rather complex

1149
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,960
we've been testing this uh something

1150
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,720
called opencipit

1151
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,040
last year and we're gonna continue

1152
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,240
testing it

1153
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,599
to get implementation experience

1154
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,680
so you have to be careful uh it's not

1155
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,680
just a replacement but a single hash

1156
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,559
algorithm it's multiple hash algorithm

1157
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,880
and a negotiation so we have to be

1158
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,720
pretty clear with the implementation

1159
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,079
guidelines

1160
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,200
for this to work so if we say in the

1161
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,400
ram rc that you only allow a single

1162
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,760
hash algorithm you're avoiding

1163
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,760
from that rfc you're avoiding the

1164
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,319
negotiation and downgrade attack problem

1165
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:22,160
problems we recommend something better

1166
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,040
as like desired

1167
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,240
but md5 is so loud maybe something like

1168
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,599
that where we can

1169
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,760
create a path to well there's there's a

1170
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,119
you need a transition issue path so so i

1171
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,119
i think that that's probably right but

1172
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:41,520
you want to drop dead date you want to

1173
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,760
you you and i i don't think that we

1174
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,119
could put a date in the

1175
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,960
rc so i'm not talking about that but um

1176
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,400
you want to yes you need transition

1177
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,040
because you can't you you can't upgrade

1178
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,559
everything instantly

1179
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,920
but um you really do want to get rid of

1180
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:00,880
md5 it's

1181
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,280
really insecure at this point really

1182
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,640
seriously

1183
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,240
does that mean that the language should

1184
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,160
just be more of the

1185
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,119
an implementation should i mean isn't

1186
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:12,800
that what it should implies

1187
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,440
the the the way i think you end up

1188
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,640
having to say it

1189
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,800
and i and ollie doesn't like this

1190
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,559
because it you can get the downgrade

1191
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,559
attack which is the part that you really

1192
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,839
don't want to do but in order to make a

1193
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,040
reasonable transition

1194
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,720
i think you'll have to use the

1195
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,480
negotiation mechanism

1196
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,640
and you'll have to allow md5 for at

1197
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,720
least some period of time

1198
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,960
and then after that you you you probably

1199
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,440
want to reject it

1200
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,160
you you add a lot of complexity that way

1201
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,200
uh

1202
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,920
i i think it would be the easier

1203
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,640
solution

1204
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,000
but uh i mean yes i mean at what extent

1205
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,280
are

1206
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,800
to what extent are rues going to be

1207
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,480
greenfield as opposed to existing

1208
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,000
deployed base if they're greenfield you

1209
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,880
can just say

1210
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,160
only ever do try 256 done right

1211
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,640
on the drew side yes on the provider

1212
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,880
side no

1213
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,359
yeah the thing is the provider's got it

1214
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,359
got a shitload of devices out in the

1215
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,000
field

1216
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,119
you know they aren't root compatible but

1217
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,160
but you know that yeah when they start

1218
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,520
supporting the roof they're still going

1219
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,839
to have to support their old devices for

1220
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,280
some period of time and if those devices

1221
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,119
you know authenticate using md5

1222
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,520
um their accounts at least have to

1223
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,800
support that

1224
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,000
you know i mean we could we

1225
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,119
can say that the roo device shall only

1226
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,240
support

1227
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,280
256 but then you've got an

1228
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,079
instantaneous you know you couldn't

1229
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:47,520
support it on the provider

1230
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,680
side until they they allowed it in the

1231
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,440
option they would have to have it

1232
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,720
optional

1233
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,520
for their old devices period i mean that

1234
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,160
would just

1235
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,079
period be true but um

1236
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,200
uh for roo devices as long as they can

1237
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,880
support it

1238
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,319
the root could be 256 only we can talk

1239
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,839
about that i think that's a

1240
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,520
somewhat separate issue what does the

1241
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,040
rue device do versus what does the

1242
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,839
provider do

1243
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,480
the provider must the providers have to

1244
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,160
be able to accept md5

1245
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,079
the question of does the rue have to

1246
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,200
generate it

1247
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,119
but does the provider have to have all

1248
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,880
of them in the same sig domain

1249
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,319
you can have different policies for

1250
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,240
different set of domains so

1251
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,240
legacy md5 compatible in one sip domain

1252
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,640
and one zip domain that requires short

1253
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,240
256

1254
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,960
for the root devices so there are

1255
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,200
migration strategies that actually work

1256
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,960
properly okay yeah what one has to help

1257
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,520
people with proposing different ways of

1258
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,960
doing this

1259
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,599
from the server side all right again

1260
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,559
i'll take a cry if

1261
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,160
we're okay with it i'll take a crack at

1262
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,319
wording and then we'll see where we are

1263
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,599
thank you isaac did you have something

1264
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:03,359
else

1265
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,640
no no well i was just wondering if we

1266
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,079
needed to add something to the

1267
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,160
configuration service

1268
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,280
to indicate and i just saw that's an

1269
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,960
interesting thought

1270
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,400
that's a real interesting thought

1271
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:20,880
otherwise how would the client know oh

1272
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,119
this this provider doesn't

1273
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,880
well the rfc the rfc has a negotiation

1274
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,960
mechanism it may maybe only

1275
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,280
okay i wasn't sure about that so that

1276
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,480
yeah that that's

1277
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:33,680
and ollie doesn't want to have to

1278
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,640
implement it because it's more

1279
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,640
complicated

1280
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,359
you get challenges and in the challenge

1281
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,040
the server says

1282
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,640
which hash mechanism right

1283
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,280
you can use and if the server supports

1284
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,640
multiple hash mechanisms

1285
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,920
you get multiple challenges

1286
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,040
okay let's again i'll take a crack at

1287
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,720
some words and we'll and

1288
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,720
we'll raise it on the list and see where

1289
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,160
we are but i think that's the way we're

1290
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,520
heading is

1291
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,520
uh support 256 must support 256 on the

1292
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,800
root device

1293
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:09,760
uh with the with a transition mechanism

1294
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,079
for

1295
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,680
providers to ease over

1296
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,480
um all right now what have i forgotten

1297
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,599
what have we not

1298
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,119
talked about that people believe are

1299
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,160
still open items

1300
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,960
hey this is isaac um

1301
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,200
so a big one is a big one in my mind is

1302
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,960
ipv6

1303
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,040
it seemed that just got added fairly in

1304
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,119
the one of the most recent updates

1305
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,040
but then there was a comment that was

1306
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,280
something to the extent of well it's no

1307
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,040
big deal you just put the client behind

1308
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,599
the gateway

1309
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,599
so we don't you know it's no big deal we

1310
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:48,880
could just say the rue is going to

1311
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,520
support ipv6

1312
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,520
and i'm i'm not sure it's quite that

1313
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,119
simple

1314
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,520
and and i also wonder if this document

1315
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,599
really only covers the inter

1316
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,240
so the comment was basically hey you put

1317
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,839
it behind a gateway

1318
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:09,040
and i'll turn my camera on for a bit

1319
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,520
um you put it behind a gateway like a

1320
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,119
nas 64 gateway i

1321
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,720
assume well i mean

1322
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,760
at least the way i know people do this

1323
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,760
is the spc does it because it's a b2b ua

1324
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,880
and it doesn't really matter what

1325
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,240
happens on the inside of the network and

1326
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,359
it only matters what happens on the

1327
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,559
outside of the network and as long as

1328
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:29,920
the sbc can

1329
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,400
be to be ua on an ipv6 address with

1330
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,040
media

1331
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,040
you're sad the the problem isn't

1332
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,480
ipv6 or ipv4 the problem arises when you

1333
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,680
have dual stacks

1334
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,079
and we've written a set of rcs we

1335
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,440
updated zip connect

1336
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,359
and we've written a lot of documents

1337
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,480
around that

1338
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,720
so dual stack is to read killer but we

1339
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,960
get sip signaling ipv4 and

1340
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,799
media offer with ipv6 and you're screwed

1341
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:59,280
right so i'm not sure that's correct

1342
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,599
because uh like so ios today we're

1343
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,520
already

1344
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,760
already ipv6 right apple requires

1345
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,040
providers only do ipv6 now

1346
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,640
yeah um so they they provide the nas 64

1347
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,319
gateway it's not the provider that's

1348
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:16,720
doing

1349
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,920
that 64 gateway they do it

1350
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,760
but there are there are some things that

1351
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,280
we had to solve

1352
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,240
like um you know for example in the stp

1353
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,079
you use ip literals

1354
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,119
right but you can't really start

1355
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,520
shoving ipv6 addresses in your sdp

1356
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,880
without well you can you can

1357
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,920
but if the other providers aren't doing

1358
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,599
it then your sdp doesn't work

1359
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,839
right well let's say you're doing let's

1360
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,839
say you're doing a call with an ipv4

1361
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,799
client

1362
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,280
on desktop well what the heck is it

1363
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,119
going to do with the ipv6 address in

1364
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,480
your sdp

1365
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,079
or you just have like 300 candidates and

1366
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,850
your sdp is like one megabyte

1367
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:06,140
[Laughter]

1368
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,000
i don't mean to try to i don't mean to

1369
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,359
try to get into solving all those issues

1370
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:12,960
but i think that the very least we need

1371
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,880
to clarify that the interface to the

1372
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,400
provider

1373
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,160
is ipv4 or i just really wonder if you

1374
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,400
i mean ipv6 is important it's another

1375
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,640
thing you just have to do it on mobile

1376
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,640
right you just have it right it's

1377
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,000
getting it

1378
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,880
right and it's getting that way in other

1379
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,040
networks although they're not

1380
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,079
hitting consumers yet but they're gonna

1381
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,839
pretty soon um

1382
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:46,799
so there are some ladies so there are

1383
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:47,760
some things

1384
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,839
um out there like that you know like

1385
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,920
there's a well-known prefix you can use

1386
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,760
to know oh okay this is really an

1387
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:56,640
ipv4 address that's been converted to

1388
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,160
ibv6

1389
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,160
and then the client knows okay i just

1390
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:03,359
need to convert this back to ibb4

1391
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:06,000
and that's what he uses in the sdp and

1392
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,400
then the other side knows okay

1393
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,520
and there's issues with dns 64

1394
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,960
right and what dns 64 does is the

1395
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,640
ipv6 client gets an ipv6 address

1396
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,799
even though there really isn't one on

1397
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,680
the server

1398
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,079
right and that's what's used for the nat

1399
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:24,880
64

1400
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,839
gateway so i can go on and on right

1401
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,440
about there's just all these things that

1402
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,799
you at least need to think through and

1403
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,480
solve

1404
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,960
i'll tell you what i think can you can

1405
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,520
you can

1406
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,200
it sounds like you've got a lot to

1407
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,640
contribute here

1408
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,880
can you indeed go on and on on the

1409
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,520
mailing list

1410
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,240
yeah well i have a limited number of

1411
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,520
hours in the day

1412
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,839
but yeah

1413
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,240
like there's a whole bunch of things we

1414
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,559
got to solve if

1415
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,119
or at the very least we say look the the

1416
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,480
providers are still ipv4

1417
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,240
and you know you're going to have this

1418
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,680
gateway but there's

1419
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,440
you know a big one is like the public ip

1420
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,760
address we need a public ip address for

1421
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,880
the

1422
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,160
uh for our cdrs for the fcc

1423
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,599
billing and so we can't

1424
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,520
i don't i don't know that we can submit

1425
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,680
an ipv6 address

1426
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,280
that would be something we might need to

1427
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,599
clarify with the fcc

1428
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,000
and that that i can get fixed for you if

1429
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,920
it's not

1430
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,920
if it's not acceptable now i can make it

1431
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,760
be acceptable in a very short period of

1432
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,920
time

1433
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,440
yeah um yeah so i think we either

1434
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,280
either need to take it out or we need to

1435
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,559
solve these things

1436
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,960
and at the very least there's a high

1437
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,599
level

1438
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,440
of well yeah you're going to use the nat

1439
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,119
64 and

1440
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,240
you're going to have to know when an

1441
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,359
ipv6 address is really ipv4

1442
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,480
and there's the well-known prefixes and

1443
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,760
although like the carriers aren't aren't

1444
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,760
doing it the way they're supposed to do

1445
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:02,960
it right they aren't using the

1446
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,720
well-known prefix

1447
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,280
so t-mobile i think uses a prefix with

1448
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,440
like 2600

1449
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,440
and every every once in a while they'll

1450
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,280
start using a new one and then we're

1451
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,200
like oh crap we got a brush have it

1452
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,640
fixed

1453
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,240
so it would be great somebody could

1454
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,400
solve that for us

1455
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,799
right but we've had to we've had to kind

1456
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:24,720
of jump through some hoops and and do

1457
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,520
some things that

1458
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,480
aren't in an rfc or a standard anywhere

1459
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,760
um so i think they're you know and i'm

1460
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,359
just giving you a few examples

1461
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:36,880
but those those are the things that we

1462
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,400
would need to write

1463
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,640
really well we're trying to create an

1464
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,680
rfc here

1465
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,799
so you know yeah that we need we know we

1466
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:46,720
cover all that stuff that isn't in the

1467
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,280
in

1468
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,400
in one yet um

1469
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,440
we're running out of time sorry we're

1470
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,760
we are running out of dual style yeah i

1471
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,440
think we are out of time

1472
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,160
we are out of time i i just wanna if i

1473
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,160
can indulge you a little bit

1474
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,920
has anyone else got an issue that has

1475
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,480
not if if anyone else has an issue that

1476
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,119
has not

1477
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:10,880
been discussed put it on the list please

1478
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:13,680
so that we know that people still still

1479
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,839
think there's things to do

1480
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,799
um it it it's real important that we

1481
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,319
understand what we need to do because we

1482
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,160
really are trying to finish

1483
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
um we clearly are going to need another

1484
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,359
revolver too

1485
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:28,400
um uh and and and there'll be some list

1486
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,839
discussion to try and

1487
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,520
figure out some of these issues like the

1488
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,520
ipv6 issue and the

1489
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,359
um the other stuff that we've talked

1490
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,119
about but um

1491
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,240
i really do appreciate go ahead

1492
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,240
i just really quick do you want i think

1493
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,920
before you indicated you wanted a

1494
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,880
separate email thread for each issue

1495
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,880
is that still the case so let's say we

1496
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,000
have i would i

1497
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,960
i i would

1498
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:55,839
no we're down we're far enough along

1499
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,280
that i don't think that we care that

1500
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,160
much now

1501
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,839
so if you got three or four issues put

1502
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:01,280
them in one email i'll deal with them

1503
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,440
individually that multiple people have

1504
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,480
done that

1505
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:07,520
so i'm used to it now go ahead and start

1506
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,119
any number of threads you want

1507
