and while taking notes do remember that

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
you just need to capture the discussion

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
and not what is being presented next

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,559
slide

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
uh this is the agenda for today uh as

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,959
noted in the list earlier

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
uh we have a very uh very packed agenda

49
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,680
and this is going to be a good test of

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,520
uh the time management skills of the

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,879
coaches

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,400
as you can see we don't have any time

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
scheduled at all for the working group

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
draft updates on the agenda

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
we sent out a link to a slide deck that

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,280
has the collated

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,599
status reports please to go through them

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,080
and use the mailing list to ask

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
questions or send in your comments

60
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,400
regarding the status of those documents

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
as always we have tried to give

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
preference to the working working group

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,480
graphs and

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
the drafts that have had some discussion

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,519
time on the list

66
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
while putting this agenda together we

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
have about 20 minutes on the agenda

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,160
today

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,160
to discuss the ietf network slice

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,280
definitions

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
and i believe there's a change in the

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
presenter reza would be presenting this

73
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,879
now

74
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,359
next slide

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,920
please do use the mailing list as much

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,599
as possible uh please be

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,400
aware that this is where the working

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,720
group consensus is actually determined

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
uh we don't know how long we'll continue

80
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,720
to be in this

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,959
online mode so we'll try and make the

82
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
best use of the tools that are

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
available to us to make progress on the

84
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
documents

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
working group members can always request

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,040
for an online interim to be scheduled if

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,760
there is

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,159
sufficient interest to cover a specific

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,599
topic

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,400
also do note that we already have

91
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,280
several working

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,599
participants making use of the working

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,040
group of webex to hold

94
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,159

95
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,599
can request the chairs if you

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,239
have such a need these meetings will be

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,239
announced on the list and will be open

98

next slide

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,959
as a reminder we do have an ipr process

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,439
in place for our working group

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,640
there are two mandatory steps um

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
before accepting a document into the

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,200
working group and before taking it to

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,159
the last call we do mandate uh all

106
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
authors and contributors of the document

107
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,599
to explicitly come out and state if they

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:15,920
are

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,839
aware of an ipr that applies to the

110
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,160
document in addition to these two

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,079
required steps we are now introducing

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,880
an uh another step in the process uh if

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,600
any new

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,240
author or contributor is added to a

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,479
working group adopted document

116
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
we do request them to send out an ipr

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,520
statement to the list

118
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,080
next slide

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
with respect to document status there

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,680
were no new rfcs published since the

121
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
last meeting

122
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,199
there is one in the rrc 8sq that's the

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
pc native ip draft

124
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,320
the draft talks about the draft that

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,199
talks about

126
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,960
gmpls signaling procedures for smp

127
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
that just finished the last call we

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,039
expect a new version to be published for

129
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,880
that before we can take it to the

130
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,080
next step we did adopt two documents

131
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,280
that were produced by the network

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,600
slicing design team

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,919
we would like to acknowledge all the

134
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,600
hard work that went in

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
into bringing these documents into this

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,120
particular stage and

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
we would like to thank everyone involved

138
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
for their efforts there is still a fair

139
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
bit of work to be done before we can

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,919
proceed towards publication with this

141
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,280
work and

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,240
we do look forward to more fruitful

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,759
discussions in the coming weeks and

144
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,240
months

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,280

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,319
regarding the pcc use cases document

156
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,080
uh we did pose the same question in the

157
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
last meeting

158
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
we asked if we should progress the

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,319
document to lc the authors left it to us

160
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,800
and there was no strong opinion

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,560
expressed one way or the other regarding

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
this by anyone in the working group

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,319
the chairs are leaning towards taking it

164
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,319
to lc in the next few weeks so

165
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
if you have any opinion on this

166
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120

167
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,039

168
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,560
chairs will discuss this further and

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,520
take

170
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,639
the necessary steps i do see through now

171
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,360
go ahead through hi probably i would

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
also suggest maybe we should talk to the

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,919
new ad

174
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,960
and see if the new isg has

175
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,520
like you know the main issue earlier was

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,319
whether

177
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,160
the use case document should be living

178
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,599
documents or whether they should be

179
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,120
published in rfcs

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,759
and maybe before we proceed uh it would

181
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,520
be good to maybe have a quick discussion

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,120
with our ad as well

183
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,759
what does the chairs think about that

184
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,000
yeah we yeah we will discuss this and

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,919
take the necessary steps uh if there is

186
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,599
any opposition going forward

187
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,319
uh on taking to the last call we will

188
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
figure that out uh during the lc process

189
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
yeah as someone who's holding the pen uh

190
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,160
there are a few sections which are empty

191
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,400
so if we proceed to working group lc

192
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,759
just give me a heads up and i will

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,400
finish up

194
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,759
on that as well sounds good yeah thanks

195
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,120
thank you next slide

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
uh there have been no liaisons or

197
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
communications received since the last

198
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,599
ietf

199
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,159
next line

200
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
uh like drew mentioned we do have a

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
change in our 80. uh

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,599
john scudder will be officially taking

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,120
over from deborah as our

204
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
ad tomorrow lou and i would like to take

205
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
this opportunity to thank

206
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,960
deborah for all the great work that he

207
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,039
has done as an ad and we would like to

208
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,400
wish her the very best with a

209
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
new role with the iab we'd also like to

210
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,479
welcome john to the working group

211
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,440
we look forward to working with you john

212
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,120
so that brings us to the end of this

213
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,639
deck

214
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,080
next up i believe is through

215
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,000
okay hi everyone i'll quickly uh go over

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
update of couple of these yang models uh

217
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,120
next slide

218
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,679
a quick overview of or what all the

219
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,599
model updates that i will be covering we

220
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,599
have a v and yang model

221
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
we have a telemetry model that augments

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,679
the itfte

223
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,240
and itf vn and then we have a service

224
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,640
mapping models which has a common types

225
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,200
and various augmentations to the service

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,839
models

227
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,560
and the network models so let's go over

228
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,440
the update

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,080
of all these model in quick fashion next

230
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,000
slide

231
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
and maybe you can skip to the next one

232
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,399
as well uh

233
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,600
yes so a quick overview this is

234
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,160
the yang model for vn operation it is

235
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,800
the customer view

236
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,160
of vn uh it reuses

237
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,880
uh the t topology and t tunnel as in

238
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,120
like vn topologies build over

239
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,600
the single node uh abstract topology

240
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
model and it uses the connectivity

241
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,399
matrix

242
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,959
uh for description of how the vm

243
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,360
connectivity and vn member connectivity

244
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
is done so this is our at a very high

245
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,200
level what is the overview

246
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,080
of this v and yang model so next slide

247
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,560
would

248
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
uh show what all updates that we have

249
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,920
made

250
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,160
we have got the yang doctor review so

251
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
thank you for that

252
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
the main comment was the handling of vn

253
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,959
compute our pc needed to be described in

254
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
a better fashion and we have done that

255
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,839
we have added error handling uh for the

256
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,240
same

257
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
as well uh we got comments that we

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
were redefining a lot of statuses so we

259
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
have gone back and used

260
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
the uh the t common types wherever we

261
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,279
could

262
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,360
so those were the comments which we have

263
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
handled uh

264
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
from andy and there were some minor

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
comments as well uh which

266
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,079
we are very thankful for uh for the

267
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
young dictator review

268
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,680
we got comments from tom petch as well

269
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,040
which were handled

270
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,399
uh in the last itf 109 we got a

271
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,839
comment related to vn compute rpc

272
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,399
there was a pending item there which was

273
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,640
describe this via figures

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
so we have done that so that should be

275
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,720
very easy for anybody to read and

276
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,519
understand

277
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
why this change was made so these were

278
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,040
all the recent changes

279
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
we still have some open issues so that's

280
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,200
next slide

281
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
uh in the open issue the main issue that

282
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,560
is pending is

283
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,600
naming uh the our earlier name is what

284
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,160
you see

285
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
up on the first point which was ap

286
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,399
access point list slash access point id

287
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
we shortened it a little bit uh made it

288
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,440
ap ap

289
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,200
id but then uh slash ap slash ap is

290
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,279
something that is not preferred

291
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,399
so we were thinking either we go uh

292
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,000
by aps as in apps or

293
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,519
maybe uh extend access point slash ap

294
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,880
slash apid

295
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
uh there is like you know mix of usage

296
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,360
of both that we saw in other published

297
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,680
uh

298
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,399
documents and this is something that we

299
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,680
have to handle at ap

300
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,079
level as well as at the vm level so if

301
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
there are some good guidance from uh

302
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,480
folks

303
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,959
uh please suggest what would be the best

304
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,160
uh naming

305
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
uh that we could settle on uh we also

306
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,279
had

307
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,440
a residual impact of one of the changes

308
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,320
that we made

309
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,839
which was about reusing p common status

310
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
uh in some places where we are using p

311
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,440
common status the

312
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,399
some of the enums or some of the values

313
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,639
like maintenance do not make sense

314
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,880
so we were thinking that maybe we can

315
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,120
just describe that in the yank text

316
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,360
that these some values are not

317
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
applicable and they should be considered

318
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,440
as

319
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,800
unknown uh as one way forward or we need

320
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,079
to redefine

321
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,720
uh the common status just for the use

322
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,639
case inside v and compute

323
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,440
so these are the two open issues uh that

324
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
are pending so if anybody has any

325
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
feedback on that please send us

326
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,959
uh either on email or right now

327
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
and then i also have an open discussion

328
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,120
point which is in the next slide

329
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,519
this discussion point is mainly about

330
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,360
how do we handle vn

331
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,480
when our vm members are realized by sr

332
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
paths or sr policy

333
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,639
uh as i was mentioning in my overview

334
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,279
that we

335
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,000
reuse t topology and we rely on the

336
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
connectivity matrix

337
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
uh uh connectivity matrix

338
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,399
but uh when the original t topology was

339
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
developed our thinking was that this

340
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,680
could be

341
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,639
uh the underlay could be rsppt parts or

342
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,800
it could be sr policy or srt

343
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,600
paths as well that doesn't seems to be

344
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,000
true

345
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,399
anymore so in this scenario what is the

346
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,519
best way to map

347
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,720
uh vn members to sr policy

348
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
and this is not just related to vm but i

349
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,959
would think that this is the bigger

350
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,519
question

351
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,360
that we should handle with respect to

352
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,839
the itfte yang model

353
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,639
uh as in what will be the relationship

354
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,839
between these models

355
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,800
and the sr policy is not very clear we

356
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
have an sr topology but we are not sure

357
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,399
whether that can play any role

358
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,040
in fact today on agenda we have t

359
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,000
profile

360
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,160
can that play a role so i was hoping

361
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
that we could like you know use this

362
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
way to trigger some discussion i can of

363
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
course take this to the list as well

364
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
and try to get more feedback on this but

365
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,839
i wanted to know whether these are the

366
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,440
right set of questions

367
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,680
with respect to discussing uh the

368
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,959
underlay of

369
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,160
sr policy with respect to vm uh before i

370
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,839
continue if there is any questions on

371
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:58,320
this

372
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
uh like maybe we can spend a few minutes

373
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,319
on that and then we can proceed

374
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,199
go ahead yeah this is starting with

375
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,079
juniper

376
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,680
um there is another model uh the roof

377
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,079
about

378
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,760
for realizing sr policies uh um

379
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,959
and um there is a separate model for te

380
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,920
tunnels

381
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,720
um originally we had thought that uh

382
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,360
tunnels

383
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
can be sr

384
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,639
you could you could you know could

385
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,880
support tunnel sr paths with uh

386
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,920
with tunnels but then spring working

387
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,480
group

388
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
uh decided that uh the sr policy

389
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,680
construct

390
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,880
is uh uh

391
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,079
it's not uh an analogous to a tunnel

392
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,760
um is that what

393
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,880
why is what's triggering your question

394
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,600
here

395
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,240
the underlay path discussion

396
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,279
yeah so yeah my requirement was that

397
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,000
when we

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,519
started with bn yang model uh we decided

399
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,440
that we would uh reuse

400
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,639
uh t tunnel and t topology as much as

401
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,519
we could but now that has led us to not

402
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,639
been able to map

403
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,199
to sr policy and that's a big issue so

404
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,639
if the conclusion is

405
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,480
that maybe we need to have some case

406
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
statement up in yang model and whether

407
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
in some cases we map to

408
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,680
t topology and uh and in some cases we

409
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,279
map to sr policy

410
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,680
that is that the way forward for us to

411
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,519
handle this but that will make things a

412
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,720
little ugly

413
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
as in currently what we have concluded

414
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
looks very very neat

415
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,759
but i'm not sure whether that's the best

416
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,440
way forward but i think

417
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
worth discussing some more exactly i i

418
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,199
agree with you

419
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,880
it's worth discussing within the working

420
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,519
group we initially we had started to

421
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,079
model

422
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,199
the sr path which is a color

423
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,240
color aware uh tunnel uh uh

424
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
in our uh t tunnel model but then we

425
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,600
backed

426
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,279
out because of the uh interest in spring

427
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,720
uh maybe we should resurrect the

428
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,680
discussion i agree

429
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,160
when we analyze the sr policy yang model

430
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,360
the main issue that we see

431
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,800
is like it is missing a lot of the

432
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,639
constraints information

433
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
that we currently have uh in in the t

434
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
tunnel model so what's happening is uh

435
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,600
that

436
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,759
from uh from the vn point of view or

437
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,720
from the

438
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
northbound interface point of view it

439
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,759
should not really matter whether the

440
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,600
underlays rsppte

441
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,079
or underlay is sr the constraints part

442
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,000
should be as similar as possible

443
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
so in some ways i think uh like you know

444
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,120
what italo

445
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,600
did for topology profile uh do we need

446
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,240
to do

447
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,079
something for tunnel profile as well

448
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,360
like you know this is

449
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
quite confusing uh so we need to like

450
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,880
you know as a working group

451
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,839
uh give a very clear uh way forward here

452
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,480
oscar can you keep make that quick

453
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,240
no just just to add that the currently

454
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,519
there's our policy model

455
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,400
is only a device model so it's it

456
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,679
augments

457
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,039
the itf routing model okay so it's not

458
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,559
applicable for

459
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,439
for a north bound and that the problem

460
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,240
is

461
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,359
is similar for the for the service

462
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,240
mapping

463
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,679
case you know there is another draft of

464
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,280
the service mapping to attach

465
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,839
tunnels to or traffic engineering

466
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,480
tunnels

467
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,080
to services layer 3 or layer 2

468
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,199
and we faced a similar problem there

469
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,400
okay so i think it's clear that the sub

470
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,679
policy data model

471
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,039
uh needs to start using uh some of the

472
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,440
tea

473
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
groupings and contains that we have

474
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,200
developed in this working group

475
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,120
i think that's an action item on the

476
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,360
essa policy young document

477
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,400
author's point but for drew for your

478
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,200
model for the

479
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,960
act and vn yang i think there are two

480
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,320
things that you

481
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,400
probably need to worry about one is the

482
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,480
underlay topology and then the underlay

483
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
parts right the underlay topology

484
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,000
you can directly reference the srt

485
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
uh topology model that uh we have

486
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,000
defined in this working group

487
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,559
i i that should work seamlessly the

488
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,440
problem is i

489
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,520
guess with respect to the underlay parts

490
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,720
the way it's defined in the t

491
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,679
topology model is it uses a generic te

492
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,720
path construct

493
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
and that doesn't necessarily align to

494
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
this notion of nasa path

495
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
but yeah do take it to the list uh maybe

496
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,240
this is something that needs to be

497
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,679
resolved

498
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,160
yeah thank you and let me just quickly

499
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,320
uh cover up

500
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
based on time maybe i think let's just

501
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
directly jump to the service mapping

502
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
and i can skip the the kpi because the

503
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,039
update is very small there

504
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
okay so this is this this is the service

505
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
mapping yank uh as

506
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
was earlier mentioning it maps the

507
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
services with the underlay resources

508
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,559
which could be t topology t

509
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,559
tunnel or vn model next slide

510
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,320
so the main change that we did was we

511
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,559
got a requirement from kenichi which was

512
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,679
discussed on the list

513
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,960
whether we should allow the l3 s7

514
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,919
l2 sm site and site network access

515
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,120
mapping which is

516
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
per qs profile level to vnab

517
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,880
vnap and this has been done what is

518
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
still missing is we need to add

519
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,640
a clear description for this use case

520
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
and that i'm discussing with kenichi and

521
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,440
we'll update

522
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,160
uh in the next version uh some other

523
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,280
changes that we made

524
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,039
uh was also to allow t mapping templates

525
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,919
which was earlier put inside a choice

526
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:36,480
statement

527
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
but since we thought that the mapping

528
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
template something that can be lived on

529
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
and it is independent of the other

530
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,520
mapping types

531
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
and we have moved it outside of the

532
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,919
choice we are added one more generic

533
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,679
container for policy requirements so

534
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,120
that they can all be grouped

535
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,320
together next slide

536
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,960
we also added some examples on how the t

537
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,960
mapping template could be used so in the

538
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
first example we are basically saying

539
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,919
that the requirement is to optimize uh

540
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,840
path metric delay average

541
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,240
in the second uh requirement we are

542
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,679
basically saying that

543
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,919
you have two constraints one is

544
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,880
bandwidth

545
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,080
and another is another is

546
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
based on hop metric similarly more

547
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,600
examples have been added

548
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,799
for ease of understanding of our models

549
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,480
uh can we directly go to the last slide

550
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,159
then hello since i'm out of time

551
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,280
so we also had some further uh

552
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
discussions that were happening uh

553
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,480
related to

554
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,520
traffic that uh how do we put

555
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
a particular map traffic to the parts

556
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,039
this is of course not part of the t

557
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,880
service mapping but this is again an

558
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
open question to the working group that

559
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,440
where should we

560
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
uh model this there are also

561
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,960
requirements with respect to calendaring

562
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
and scheduling t resources

563
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,039
which are currently not modeled and we

564
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,000
are not sure

565
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,840
because the requirements somehow got

566
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,919
came to us but we were not sure whether

567
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:02,480
our

568
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,159
young model is the best way but we

569
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,840
wanted to trigger some discussion on

570
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,960
where to model these

571
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
in future and that's it i'm done thank

572
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,280
you

573
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,840
okay thanks drew uh elin

574
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,280
can you hear me clear uh this is not the

575
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,840
slide deck

576
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:45,840
so give me a second

577
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,120
okay okay thank you chess and this is

578
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
healing on behalf of

579
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,080
the others list here to present a slide

580
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,640
for the

581
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
interworking of jmps control and the

582
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,200
centralized control system

583
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,240
next slides please

584
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,559
um uh the uh this job is actually about

585
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,520
describes

586
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,720
uh how the gmp control system can

587
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,480
interact with the centralized control

588
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
system um but

589
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,919
in different scenarios for example

590
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,799
multi-domain multi-layer or

591
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,159
recovery scenarios and the main changes

592
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,600
of this zero five version is that we

593
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
we added a description about the sp

594
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
recovery in the jmps and centralized

595
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,240
controller system in the working

596
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,679
scenario

597
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,039
and next page please

598
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,919
so this slides shows shows a brief

599
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,360
introduction of the idea of this draft

600
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,640
so we know we have the gmps control

601
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,679
system and in each domain and we

602
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,400
also we may also have other domains have

603
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
which are running different

604
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,520
different protocols than umps and

605
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
as you and on on top of them we also

606
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,799
introduced the

607
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,440
act the centralized conjunction such as

608
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,200
the actin architecture

609
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,520
and the centralized control system and

610
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,240
the

611
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,960
distributed gms consistent they are not

612
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,000
competing to each

613
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
other but they can work together to make

614
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
better control of the network

615
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,919
so that's the main idea of this draft

616
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,960
next slides please

617
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,640
so um what we uh added in this

618
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,679
new version is that we uh and we had we

619
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,720
are actually

620
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,000
analyzed on how the sp is recovered

621
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
in the uh in this gps and controller

622
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,960
interworking scenario

623
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,200
so actually there are three scenarios

624
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,240
the span

625
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
protection uh sp protection and speed

626
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,120
restoration

627
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,240
so for spend protection the first one is

628
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,080
actually a kind of a link level

629
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,200
protection so we believe there are no

630
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,919
new extension needed for in these

631
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,960
scenarios

632
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,840
and in second one the sp protection uh

633
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,760
we think that the centralized controller

634
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,679
can help on the

635
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,559
destroyed the centralized way of past

636
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,840
computation for the

637
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,200
joint past past computation

638
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,240
and in the switchover

639
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,880
stage we can still use the distributed

640
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,360
way

641
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,559
to do the protection switch over because

642
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,159
it

643
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,200
is a much faster reaction in the

644
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,120
distributed way and for the airspeed

645
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,080
restoration

646
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,559
there are two kind of method one is the

647
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,279
pre

648
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,880
uh preplanned as period uh restoration

649
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
and the other one is the full spirit

650
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,080
routine um

651
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,440
so for the pre plan sp reloading

652
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,000
uh similar to the sp protection at the

653
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,080
sense the centralized controller can

654
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,520
help on the central's pass computation

655
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,640
and considering with the result sharing

656
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,200
on the

657
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,960
protecting our space because it has the

658
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
global view of the network and for the

659
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,279
full speed

660
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,679
reloading uh the centralized controller

661
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
can

662
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,240
help on the pre compute of the reloading

663
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,640
path

664
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,799
installed in the controller or in the

665
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,640
source node of the of the

666
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,240
sp and uh once the

667
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,039
the network change we the controller can

668
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,320
trigger the

669
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,720
refreshment of the um pre-computing

670
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,320
restoration path to make the uh

671
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,360
better use of the resources so to sum up

672
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,559
uh we think that centralized consortium

673
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,600
can take the

674
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,240
advantage of uh centralized past

675
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,600
computation

676
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
and the distributed control plane can

677
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,760
help to

678
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,720
make a faster reaction to the next event

679
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,679
for example the

680
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,080
switch over etc that's the main idea

681
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,440
next page please

682
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,559
we think we have finished most of the

683
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,279
work of this

684
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,559
uh draft so we kindly asked the expert

685
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,360
in the

686
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,559
tease to help us to review on this draft

687
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,279
and feedback to us by uh for example the

688
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:25,760
email

689
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,200
a mailing list and before we add

690
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,720
before we ask him for wj last call so

691
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,840
that's all for the slides thank you

692
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,600
comments uh one thing i noticed in

693
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
reading the document is you don't cover

694
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,159
fr and that's probably something fast

695
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,360
reroute you probably want to add that

696
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,039
oh about yeah and yeah we can

697
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,679
consistent

698
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,039
yeah yeah i think we can add more

699
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,080
tests about fr in the next version great

700
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,600
thank you

701
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,840

success

708
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,039
i'm going to present the itf network

709
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,080
spice draft

710
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,640
next please

711
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
uh if there is any question it would be

great if you can hold on to your

713
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,679
question we have at the end the q a q a

714
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,399
hopefully

715
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,159
as we go through the slides i will

716
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,000
answer the question as well

717
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,240
so the current status of the document uh

718
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,000
as uh most of you are

719
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,600
ever uh this document has been adopted

720
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,360
as a working group document the

721
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,120
beginning of this year

722
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,640
most notably the the term the

723
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,399
transfer slice is renamed to itf network

724
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,320
slides there are lots of good discussion

725
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,039
i

726
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,120
encourage you to take a look at the link

727
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
which is giving here why we

728
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,640
come up with that name and

729
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,559
for last few weeks there are lots of

730
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,480
good discussion on the mailing list

731
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,399
about the draft

732
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,640
and these are the area which was

733
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,520
discussed

734
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,360
uh and as i go through uh this slide for

735
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,559
each of them i have one

736
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,760
try to describe that we send

737
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
a comprehensive response also to mailing

738
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,960
lists

739
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,520
last week again the link is here you can

740
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
take a look at

741
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
whatever we discussed today basically

742
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,159
the

743
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,279
detailed description will be in that

744
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,799
mailing list next please

745
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,720
the the first item and the suggestion

746
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,679
from the mailing list was that to use a

747
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,760
term service and consider the

748
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,799
ieta network as life as a service as we

749
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,960
outline here the the co-authors are

750
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,919
do agree with the suggestion and as a

751
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,200
result of that

752
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,679
as we will go through the slice today we

753
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,120
will see that you know generally the

754
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,480
network applies

755
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,039
it's considered a service which has few

756
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:31,919
artifacts

757
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,039
endpoint connection and slo and we will

758
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,520
discuss

759
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,080
endpoint momentarily but this is

760
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,840
something that we agree with with the

761
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,679
suggestion and will be

762
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,760
included in the next version of the

763
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,039
document

764
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,600
next please

765
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,520
next slide please

766
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,559
to remind the authors that as a working

767
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,919
group document

768
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,200
um the working group consensus is what

769
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,919
dominates

770
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,159
not the author's opinion and it's the

771
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:06,960
authors

772
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
actually the editor's obligation to

773
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,240
match what the

774
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,880
working group decides not what the

775
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,600
authors

776
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,240
uh decide so i it was probably just a

777
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,600
turn or phrase to say the authors agree

778
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,679
you know it's important that as a

779
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,960
working group document it's that the

780
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,320
working group agrees and that you're

781
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,679
capturing that

782
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,360
so a minor point i just want to make

783
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,399
sure we're all on the same page

784
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,679
yeah surely so

785
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,000
there was a very good discussion a lot

786
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,080
of good discussion about

787
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,360
network slides endpoints nse

788
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,200
and the mailing list opinion was to

789
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,520
use terminology that is related to the

790
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,559
cps

791
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,159
the cep terminology so

792
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,679
as stated here

793
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,360
we compiled the value suggestion that

794
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,720
was given that we have the pros and cons

795
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,640
of each one the yellow item in the

796
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,360
middle

797
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,480
there was a suggestion for the ap v

798
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,320
as a co-author suggested nsap

799
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,399
and nse and the access circuit and ce

800
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,799
and the idea here is that

801
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,799
we do agree with the basically

802
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,120
the suggestion here that we have to use

803
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,000
the cp

804
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,640
uh cepe terminology uh having said that

805
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,000
since the cotton code

806
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,799
endpoint in this case is not really

807
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,279
mapped

808
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,519
is not either of those you know ceop but

809
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,200
mapped to that one during the

810
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,559
realization

811
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,679
so the suggestion that we have is and

812
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,279
we're putting on the mailing list we

813
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,080
need the

814
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,080
everybody's opinion that we are

815
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,360
suggesting to use

816
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,519
a tab to have that abstraction view

817
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,000
between

818
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,919
p and c e something similar to ap

819
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,960
or nsat which is aligned with the

820
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,159
vn80 and we put the rfc here

821
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,840
uh i don't know if you wanted the

822
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
have the question right now or later

823
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,880
joel

824
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,200
you are in line this slide does not

825
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,440
reflect or correspond to the discussion

826
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,039
we had on the list

827
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,960
i don't know what the chairs think the

828
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,039
conclusion of the discussion was

829
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,440
but i can't get from that discussion to

830
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,039
your assertion that you need a different

831
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:35,679
term

832
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,600
or to this list of terms that you have

833
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,919
put on this list

834
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,760
so i think this is simply a mistaken

835
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,720
conclusion from the discussion

836
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,120
so what is the conclusion that you have

837
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
uh joe

838
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,320
okay i don't know what the working

839
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,840
group's conclusion is

840
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,480
i know what my suggestion was which was

841
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,039
that the

842
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,440
end point of the ietf network slice was

843
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,279
the pe

844
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,000
which you have explicitly excluded from

845
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,640
your list of choices

846
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,679
and the the other suggestion that i saw

847
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,360
was that the end point of the ietf

848
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,240
network slice

849
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,600
service was the ce that seemed to be a

850
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,679
really nice way to distinguish

851
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,039
what we were talking about in the

852
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
various ways but that's only one

853
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,600
alternative

854
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,080
but this table does not summarize the

855
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,559
discussion

856
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,289
[Music]

857
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
italia you are on the list that you want

858
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,159
to ask questions

859
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,760
for just a comment that ap and vnap

860
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,519
are not exactly the same thing in

861
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,919
rfc8453

862
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,200
so the vnap is the association of an ap

863
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:49,760
with

864
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,799
one vn because the ap can be used by

865
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,559
multiple vns

866
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,880
and basically the ap represents the

867
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,480
point

868
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,000
as you said where you have

869
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,080
it's a resource between a customer and a

870
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
provider and you can use this ap

871
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,399
for multiple vn and when you assign the

872
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,119
ap

873
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,199
to a given vn then you have the vnap and

874
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,280
you can have multiple vienna starting

875
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,199
from the same ap

876
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,679
so exactly because of that the reason we

877
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,560
are suggesting

878
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,679
nsap similar to that to europe oh okay

879
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,800
okay okay yeah

880
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399
okay okay yeah that would be a line

881
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,839
yeah the if there is any other

882
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,079
suggestion that joel mentioned that is

883
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,280
not here

884
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,599
we will take a look at the mailing list

885
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,159
and we will

886
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,079
include them here to make sure the

887
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,079
completeness of this list

888
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,879
the captures everybody's opinion on that

889
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,280
one

890
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,000
and we put it on the mailing list for

891
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,879
the further

892
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,319
suggestion or conclusion

893
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,319
next slide please

894
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,079
some of the discussion that the joel

895
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:04,800
mentioned

896
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,200
is captured here as well now come back

897
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,440
the next step about the next discussion

898
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,520
that we had on the mailing it was

899
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,720
related to how we are mapping the

900
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,240
network slides during the realization as

901
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,440
the the the discussion for the the

902
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,920
ietf network slice is an abstraction

903
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,400
connectivity when it comes to the

904
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,520
the real network realization part there

905
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,079
are

906
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,119
two main category of the use cases and

907
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,880
also as suggested by the the few people

908
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,520
on the megalin is we use the figure 2

909
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,520
of the rfc 3985 as a base for

910
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,920
our discussion the two types of the

911
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,760
category for the use cases are

912
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,000
described here in short and in the

913
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,960
mailing list we have the more detail

914
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,400
for example for the first case which

915
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,880
the end point during the realization

916
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
mapped to the ce

917
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,280
the prime example of this type of use

918
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,079
cases

919
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,200
are in their mobility for your 5g and i

920
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,680
put a few uh two examples here

921
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,079
in the backhaul or the meethal network

922
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,800
this is

923
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,000
the kind of the mapping that will happen

924
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,200
again mapping happen

925
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,280
when we want to realize that we know the

926
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,359
network and we want to

927
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,400
realize in the network the second type

928
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,800
of the use case the mapping happened

929
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,240
on the pe side again two examples were

930
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,800
given here when we want for example

931
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,280
these are

932
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,839
not the use cases these are just a few

933
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,079
use cases to capture the idea

934
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,920
data center interconnect and the

935
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,359
wholesale transfer

936
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,240
in those cases when the transfer slides

937
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,599
will be

938
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,400
realized in the network operator use the

939
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,440
pe

940
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,400
to realize that and if we go to the next

941
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,520
slide

942
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,560
we have the picture view of these two

943
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,280
three slides that is explained here

944
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
this is based on that rfc 3985

945
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,720
we included the idea of for example on

946
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,079
the top picture

947
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,480
there are a network of slice number two

948
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,800
iit network advisor is number two

949
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,079
there are some the

950
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,599
endpoint or whatever term that we are

951
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,359
going to come up as a main

952
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,200
as a the working group it maps to pe

953
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,359
which is during the realization of the

954
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
transfers

955
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,320
sorry network slide and s2 is that

956
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,880
realization that happens in the network

957
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,440
and very similar to that one in the

958
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,560
bottom picture

959
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,599
we described whatever is described

960
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,839
before in the you know in a kind of

961
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,040
graphical way

962
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,079
that mapping now it happens

963
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,520
to the ce there are lots of similarity

964
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,599
obviously there are a lot of differences

965
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,359
and subtle differences between

966
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,400
those two pictures so this

967
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,599
is capturing the idea of the

968
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,800
end point and the mapping so that we

969
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,560
believe that these are

970
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
related related to each other has

971
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,400
relationship with each other and

972
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,920
hopefully this picture

973
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,800
captures the idea if the answer is we

974
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,000
can modify that

975
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,320
i really encourage everyone to send out

976
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
the suggestion that how we can make this

977
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,280
picture

978
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,359
the reflection of the discussion that we

979
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,760
have i really need the

980
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,839
consensus on this one from the mailing

981
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,040
list any

982
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,720
feedback will be appreciated

983
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,040
if we go to the second last slide

984
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
there was another discussion about the

985
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
consumer

986
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,680
versus customer again with the

987
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,480
lose the uh when he mentioned something

988
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,520
at the beginning

989
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,560
that maybe english agreed that

990
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,920
this term can be used but

991
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,800
we agreed that this could be either or

992
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,040
we need more concerns on the main links

993
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,560
to see which one that

994
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,200
we have to pick but there are some good

995
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,000
summary from

996
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,400
adrian that i included here just for

997
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,760
your reference that

998
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,440
when we talk about consumer and

999
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,359
customers some of these words are really

1000
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,000
overloaded depends on who you talk to

1001
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,240
and from which vantage point you are

1002
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,280
looking at that

1003
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,640
there are no single definition of either

1004
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,200
or

1005
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,520
and this is up to the discussion on the

1006
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,400
mailing list

1007
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,760
the the we believe that the

1008
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,640
either term could be potentially a

1009
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,839
candidate but again

1010
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
when there is a consensus that will be

1011
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,599
included in

1012
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,599
the the next version of the draft

1013
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,320
john please

1014
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,839
john it seems that you have a big

1015
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
question

1016
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,720
okay i cannot hear him i don't know if

1017
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,599
this is

1018
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,480
the case there's an issue john you can

1019
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,680
ask you a question you cannot mute

1020
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,160
yourself and

1021
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,720
john you can also type it in jabber yeah

1022
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
i guess the question is

1023
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
when are the chairs going to decide the

1024
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,078
consensus on terminology

1025
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,079
i think the discussion is still um

1026
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:38,880
ongoing

1027
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,160
and maybe we're getting closer

1028
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,920
uh ultimately we like for the

1029
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,880
um editors of the document to make the

1030
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,359
call

1031
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,119
and if they don't then we'll make the

1032
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,800
call

1033
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,599
but i i don't think we have uh i think

1034
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,640
joel's right

1035
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,440
we have not fully closed it on the list

1036
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,560
i'm not sure that's what joel said

1037
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,359
um what i said was that the list that

1038
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,520
they had captured was not the full list

1039
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,599
that had been brought forward in the

1040
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,560
discussion

1041
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,640
that's separate from whether there is or

1042
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,319
is not a rough consensus on what the

1043
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,440
answer is

1044
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,480
that i think in this situation

1045
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,440
the working group chairs need to be

1046
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,119
watching for and judge when it is

1047
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,640
achieved

1048
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,400
we're we're watching and um

1049
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,599
we think there's still a little more

1050
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,480
room for discussion

1051
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:48,480
eric

1052
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,680
do you need to unmute okay i did

1053
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,078
good okay so

1054
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,079
unfortunately um

1055
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,040
so a couple of things one one thing at

1056
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,160
the very beginning of the

1057
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,000
presentation you started with uh

1058
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,040
this is the green networks like

1059
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,240
actually just definitions

1060
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,280
um mostly about terminology

1061
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,160
eric you are breaking up uh it's not a

1062
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,200
generalized graph

1063
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,640
and uh the thing is

1064
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,839
part of the dishonest is driven by

1065
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,800
need to eventually i think merge these

1066
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,000
graphs

1067
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,160
and so we kind of have consensus on what

1068
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,359
this is going to say

1069
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,839
that's it

1070
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,560
eric i'm not sure i got everything you

1071
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,119
said

1072
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,319
uh i think you're um saying that there's

1073
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,760
agreement on

1074
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,000
that we have a definitions document we

1075
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,599
have a homework document and we have an

1076
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,480
expectation of

1077
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,880
emerging uh i think you said one

1078
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,720
additional point in there but i didn't

1079
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,960
hear it

1080
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,800
it's funny i'm hearing myself being

1081
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,079
echoed from somebody else

1082
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:14,880
um the other point that i think is we

1083
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,160
need to

1084
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,359
arrive at consensus on terminology

1085
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,599
as quickly as we can we can't do any

1086
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,079
merging

1087
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,000
unless the determine that that's the

1088
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,520
best way to

1089
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,079
get consent

1090
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,440
was that clearer chairs have talked

1091
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
sort of reached the same conclusion as

1092
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,720
we'd like to get the

1093
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,280
terminology solid as quickly as possible

1094
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,079
and then

1095
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,000
move on with emerge right

1096
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,640
so this is the last slide from my site

1097
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,839
uh

1098
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,040
the just uh

1099
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,839
working with the mailing list uh and uh

1100
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,119
get all the suggestion consensus and

1101
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,240
included the next draft any other

1102
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,800
discussion and comments are also welcome

1103
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,119
thanks

1104
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:37,280
any other comments for fresher

1105
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,520
as we move on to the next um

1106
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,640
presentation

1107
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,480
i think this is a good point to mention

1108
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,680
that um

1109
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,720
we have a a bunch of documents

1110
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,839
now that are moving more towards

1111
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,160
solutions

1112
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,680
and we're happy that we now have

1113
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,520
the definition document close i know

1114
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,920
we're not done and a frame an adopted

1115
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,839
framework to serve as a foundation for

1116
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,119
those

1117
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,839
excuse me those definition documents we

1118
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,440
do think that there's a bunch of good

1119
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,680
text in those documents that could go

1120
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,640
to the framework and are going to

1121
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,359
suggest

1122
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,240
to those authors to make suggestions on

1123
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,359
the list

1124
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,640
to incorporate uh

1125
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,079
pieces that they think are missing in

1126
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,240
the framework and suggest that they

1127
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,119
bring it into

1128
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,599
uh make sure specific suggestions on

1129
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,960
what they would like to see with

1130
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,880
in what is now a working group document

1131
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,480
so with that we're going to go on to

1132
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,280
this one's next

1133
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,759
uh sorry i'll have to find the right

1134
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,839
presentation

1135
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,200
you're next can you

1136
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,079
oh okay all right these are our slides

1137
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,800
can you hear me

1138
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,200
yeah okay um hello everyone my name is

1139
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:15,839
tariq

1140
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,040
and i'm going to give you an update on

1141
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,000
this document that that's a solution

1142
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,400
document for realizing network slices in

1143
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,200
ip and

1144
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,200
mpls networks um the update is on the

1145
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,400
behalf of the

1146
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,760
co-authors shown on the slide next slide

1147
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,079
please

1148
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,839
okay so uh on my agenda is a quick

1149
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,760
update uh and then i'll do a recap of

1150
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,720
the solution

1151
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,880
that we're proposing and then close off

1152
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,040
with some next steps

1153
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,880
next slide please

1154
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,720
so since last uh presented in itf 109

1155
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,000
we have added uh some key terminology to

1156
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,319
the draft

1157
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,839
and we've merged the draft uh

1158
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,359
network slicing into this one

1159
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,040
the co-authors joined this effort

1160
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,680
and we've received some very useful

1161
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,079
feedback from the working group

1162
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,240
and we've addressed those comments in

1163
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,119
the

1164
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,240
uh recent revision uh

1165
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,400
lastly some new co-authors joined and

1166
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,160
we thank the working group for the

1167
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,040
review comments that were provided

1168
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,839
the next slide please

1169
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,000
so some key terminology that was added

1170
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,920
or uh clarified

1171
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,480
we have the slice policy it's a

1172
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,680
construct

1173
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,920
that is used to support iedf network

1174
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,960
slices uh

1175
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,400
instantiation the enforcement of the

1176
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,559
slice policy on network elements

1177
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,440
creates this slice aggregate and the

1178
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,359
slice aggregate is a collection of

1179
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,559
packets

1180
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,280
that match a selection criteria and are

1181
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,160
offered the same forwarding treatment

1182
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,599
the slice aggregate may be comprised of

1183
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,319
one or more

1184
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:17,359
itf network slices or slice

1185
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,960
slice traffic streams the the mapping of

1186
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,520
one or more itf network slices

1187
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,839
uh to a slice aggregate is maintained in

1188
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:26,640
the

1189
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,760
uh itf network size controller i see

1190
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,440
people are lining up on the

1191
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,400
on the mic i don't want to be rude so

1192
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,920
it's up to the chairs if

1193
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,640
they want to let

1194
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,880
people ask their questions or i can

1195
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,040
continue i don't mind either way

1196
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,520
you have eight minutes to do with run as

1197
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,119
you see fit um

1198
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,680
it's very hard really discussion is good

1199
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,040
discussion is good you know people can

1200
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,839
write

1201
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,880
some slides okay thank you for all

1202
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,200
you know making me uh the choice take

1203
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,920
the call

1204
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,480
uh adrian please go ahead yeah thank you

1205
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,760
uh try to be brief

1206
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,319
i'm i'm struggling with the term slice

1207
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,440
policy

1208
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,559
uh because it it it didn't

1209
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,839
fit with the meaning that i expected

1210
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,680
um which was the set of rules

1211
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,119
that a router might apply to a um

1212
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,760
to a big pile of packets in order to

1213
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,119
decide which packets

1214
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,640
went on to which slice um

1215
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
and that doesn't seem to fit here with

1216
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,160
um with with the

1217
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,480
the phrase and which i can't quite

1218
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,760
decipher

1219
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,960
the the instantiation of mechanisms uh i

1220
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,040
wonder if you could

1221
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,520
try to clarify that that definition of

1222
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,079
policy

1223
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,040
for us indeed indeed definitely that if

1224
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,559
you if you hold off

1225
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:51,599
till the next slide or subsequent slides

1226
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,079
it will talk about the uh parts of a

1227
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,359
slice policy

1228
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,240
and par and part of that slice policy is

1229
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:58,800
a rule

1230
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,839
that says what identifies a packet as

1231
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,359
belonging to a slice

1232
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,559
aggregate and there are other rules in

1233
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,079
the slice policy

1234
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,760
uh we can talk about them in the

1235
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,200
subsequent slides and

1236
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,240
i'll let you you know chime in

1237
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,000
after we go through the different parts

1238
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,760
i do now that i was

1239
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,319
given the choice maybe it's better that

1240
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:24,800
we

1241
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,599
asked the questions after so i'll

1242
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,319
progress

1243
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,680
uh given the time constraint so here's a

1244
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,960
an attempt to quickly uh define the life

1245
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,520
of an

1246
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,640
itf network slice we have a northbound

1247
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,359
interface

1248
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,359
that the customer the slice customer

1249
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,800
provides their intent and

1250
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,680
and the controller well part of the itf

1251
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,359
network slice controller

1252
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,599
is to create and manage this network

1253
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,559
slice and

1254
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,599
aggregate multiples of these itf slices

1255
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,480
into one slice aggregate

1256
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,119
and then map the slice aggregate or

1257
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,680
assign it a specific topology

1258
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,079
and do resource allocations and the last

1259
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,040
step is to push

1260
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,319
this slice policy definition on select

1261
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,920
network elements in

1262
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,440
in the network and as we

1263
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,400
as we described on the earlier slide the

1264
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,040
the

1265
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,800
enforcement of the slice policy on

1266
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,319
network elements

1267
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,240
results in the slice aggregate

1268
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,920
instantiation

1269
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,280
how do we place paths within a slice

1270
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,960
we have we can do that on demand

1271
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,880
and use a suitable path control

1272
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,839
technique

1273
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,359
in fact we do not advocate a specific

1274
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,880
one but we we can

1275
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,760
we can work with any uh of the path

1276
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,359
setup control techniques uh

1277
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,240
defined at idf next slide please

1278
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,280
so a recap on the the slice policy it

1279
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,000
has

1280
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,920
four major parts a data plane selector

1281
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,720
this is what identifies uh a packet as

1282
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,960
belonging to a slice aggregate

1283
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,160
a set of control plane resource rules

1284
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,240
so these are like bandwidth reservations

1285
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,520
uh policies

1286
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,480
that are enforced in the control plane

1287
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,359
and there are

1288
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,640
data plane resources um um

1289
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,079
rules that are uh downloaded in the data

1290
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:29,200
plane like

1291
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,440
queuing and and so on and drop

1292
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,200
probability

1293
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,680
and lastly is a customized topology for

1294
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,319
the slice aggregate it basically defines

1295
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:41,200
what resources are part of this slice

1296
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,640
aggregate what links and nodes

1297
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,960
define the membership of this slice

1298
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,920
aggregate

1299
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,680
now this dissemination of this slice

1300
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,240
policy the slice policy can be

1301
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,520
uh defined on a network slice controller

1302
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,680
and then disseminated into the network

1303
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,040
using

1304
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,440
a multiple techniques you can download

1305
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,079
them using netconf or

1306
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,359
advertise it in igp or any or

1307
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,559
bgp for that purpose as i mentioned

1308
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,960
earlier the path control technologies

1309
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,520
multiple flavors can be supported to

1310
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,359
select a specific path

1311
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:22,960
within a network slice next slide please

1312
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,640
so the data plane identifier that can be

1313
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,119
carried

1314
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,319
in the packet can take multiple forms

1315
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:34,400
one can think of the vpn vpn label

1316
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,079
if the vpn labels can be classified and

1317
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,880
inspected on transit nodes a range of

1318
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,000
vpn labels can

1319
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,960
map to one slice aggregate now we

1320
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,240
understand this may

1321
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,040
not be the most favored option but we

1322
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,480
are putting it on

1323
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,720
on the slide as an option the other

1324
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,599
option is a

1325
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,520
the forwarding label or the transport

1326
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,800
label

1327
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,079
can carry context

1328
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,640
the slice aggregate context itself and

1329
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,520
then a packet

1330
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,599
arriving with this forwarding label will

1331
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,319
map to the slice aggregate

1332
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,400
other options the that we are looking

1333
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,640
into is carrying a specific field

1334
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,359
in the packet uh it can be called as a

1335
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:15,839
slice

1336
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,040
identifier or a slid uh there are

1337
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:19,680
multiple

1338
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,880
uh attempts to uh uh to realize this or

1339
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:23,920
to carry this

1340
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,119
in different data planes uh we i i did

1341
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:28,160
mention multiple

1342
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,359
drafts here one of them uh is proposing

1343
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:32,240
carrying the slid

1344
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,640
inside the entropy label in mpls the

1345
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,480
other is defining another

1346
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,960
uh another field a forwarding action

1347
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,079
field

1348
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,559
um lastly it could be a multi-field

1349
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,000
packet selector

1350
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,720
that determines the slice two minutes

1351
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,119
okay

1352
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,920
next uh next please next slice next

1353
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,119
slide

1354
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,200
so the slice resources a few minutes

1355
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,319
concluding discussion

1356
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,359
that was two minutes including

1357
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,640
discussion so you might want to wrap up

1358
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,520
so you give a little

1359
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,119
time for discussion so the slice policy

1360
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,880
resources i did mention the control

1361
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,000
plane resources and data plane resources

1362
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,559
these are also rules that are downloaded

1363
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,079
as part of the slice

1364
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,079
next please next slide

1365
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,599
the slice topology i did mention and i'm

1366
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,480
reiterating here

1367
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,119
it defines the membership of the

1368
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,040
specific network elements that

1369
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,920
are part of this slice and these can

1370
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,400
help

1371
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,599
do path placement or slice aware traffic

1372
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,280
engineering

1373
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,880
there are multiple forms how we can

1374
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,839
identify a topology for a slice i did

1375
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:36,400
mention

1376
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
a couple of them on the slide next slide

1377
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,720
please

1378
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,520
i am going to skip talking in detail

1379
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,880
about the modes

1380
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,119
we have identified multiple modes in the

1381
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:49,359
draft so i encourage people to

1382
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,520
go through the different modes for

1383
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,480
slicing

1384
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,599
in the control plane and data plane that

1385
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,319
we can do with the slice policy

1386
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,640
in terms of next steps we we have

1387
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,760
presented this work

1388
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,920
in last ietf we welcome further review

1389
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,000
from the working group and feedback

1390
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,960
and we think that it is stable enough so

1391
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,160
that we can ask for

1392
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,839
uh working group adoption thank you

1393
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,920
shall we take a couple of questions

1394
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,359
let's try to keep it really brief

1395
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,280
um we do have four minutes at the end of

1396
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,200
our agenda so we'll end up using a

1397
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:31,839
little that now

1398
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,280
okay chen how go ahead

1399
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,880
uh the new terms uh slicer

1400
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,520
slicer aggregates and less policy a

1401
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,640
little

1402
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,760
confusing is there any difference

1403
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,559
from the term within we can plus

1404
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,720
framework

1405
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,559
that's a very good question we've

1406
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,359
already uh engaged um

1407
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,359
yeah i mean on the list as well there

1408
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,920
were points made that the vtn

1409
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,599
um resembles some uh similarities with a

1410
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,720
slice aggregate

1411
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,040
we don't think that slice aggregate is a

1412
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,839
topology

1413
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,240
so that's one thing that uh the authors

1414
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,079
of this draft

1415
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,960
are keen on is that it is not a slice

1416
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,799
aggregate is not a topology a slice

1417
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,240
aggregate

1418
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,559
has a set of links and resources and

1419
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:27,520
nodes that

1420
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,559
uh are member of the slice aggregate it

1421
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:31,520
also has

1422
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,280
the you know other parts that i

1423
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,040
described um

1424
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,359
the topology is one part of it so that's

1425
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,440
one difference that we disagree that

1426
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,319
a vtn is not equal to a slice angry

1427
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:55,839
i think robin is next

1428
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,359
hello yes

1429
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,640
uh performance first in fact in

1430
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,599
our meetings availability draft we

1431
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,480
already

1432
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,520
indicated the vtn is also

1433
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,400
can be used to indicate the resource in

1434
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,040
the

1435
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,000
data plane for the isolated network

1436
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,440
slides

1437
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,400
well at the same time is associated with

1438
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,760
the topology

1439
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,799
attribute i wish the co-author

1440
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,000
the author of this draft can have more

1441
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
have more uh reveal on our draft

1442
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,559
the first one the second one i explained

1443
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,119
concern

1444
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,319
in the uh in the main list because now

1445
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,520
there's uh

1446
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,920
many this draft in the npr's working

1447
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,400
group cx man working group under this

1448
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,520
working group

1449
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,400
proper the similar idea to encapsulate

1450
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,040
the id

1451
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,400
information in the data plane but

1452
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,240
now there's a different

1453
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,799
name for the id here you have the right

1454
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,839
id and also it says

1455
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,599
sorry you're picking up robin for me and

1456
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,040
i don't know if you asked the question

1457
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,359
i i think he's um bringing up a couple

1458
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:23,759
of points

1459
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,799
i i think he's suggesting that there's

1460
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,480
some terminology overlapping

1461
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,720
between conceptual overlap even though

1462
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,079
the terms are different between your

1463
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,119
draft and his

1464
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,920
draft and i think he's suggesting maybe

1465
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,400
to

1466
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,240
figure out how to align them or work

1467
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,440
work together

1468
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,760
uh i think that's what he's saying uh i

1469
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,520
may get it wrong i have gotten it wrong

1470
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,200
yeah sure thanks for decoding that uh

1471
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,960
thank you for decoding that and yeah i

1472
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,640
uh i agree

1473
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,440
we need uh we need to investigate

1474
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,160
further

1475
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,440
um alignment in terms of the terminology

1476
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,319
um yeah we will take it uh a step

1477
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,760
forward no problem

1478
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,280
yeah we we really are are over um so we

1479
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,640
have three people and

1480
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,960
i'd like them to to ask if they don't

1481
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,640
mind taking it to the list

1482
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,160
if they really feel that they need to

1483
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,640
say something on record you know

1484
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,720
like 15 seconds each please

1485
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,040
jay zafar do you think you really have

1486
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,440
to say it

1487
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,000
if if not please do take your comments

1488
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,200
to the list

1489
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,559
um uh i i do think that uh going back to

1490
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,559
adrian's comment on policy

1491
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,400
you are introducing some new concepts

1492
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,000
here please consider whether or not they

1493
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,760
belong in the framework or belong in a

1494
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,280
specific solution

1495
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,960
document and with that

1496
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,119
we're going to move on i'm going to

1497
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,720
assume people just left themselves in

1498
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,119
queue

1499
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,640
even though they don't really want to be

1500
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,240
there

1501
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,480
we're going to go to luis's uh slice

1502
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,880
controller as soon as i find it

1503
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,920
so luis if you can unmute and uh bring

1504
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,559
it up

1505
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,079
that would be great can you hear me

1506
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,920
yes you sound great i'll i'm gonna go on

1507
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,440
mute uh also

1508
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,040
okay thank you so well i will provide an

1509
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,079
update of the

1510
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,319
of the draft that was already presented

1511
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,920
during the last itf

1512
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,319
so i cannot see yet the slides not sure

1513
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:22,400
if it's my fault or

1514
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,640
my computer's being slow you're good now

1515
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,599
okay

1516
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,760
so i will do that on behalf of all my

1517
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,119
co-authors so please next

1518
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,480
so just as a refreshment of what was

1519
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,599
presented the idea

1520
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,760
of this draft was essentially to present

1521
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,920
or to identify major components

1522
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,599
within the network size controller the

1523
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,839
idf network last controller

1524
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,839
and also to understand how the

1525
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,520
associated data models could apply to

1526
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,040
these different components to

1527
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,760
the structure that we foresee for that

1528
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,200
so the structure essentially

1529
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
consists on two main components the

1530
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,799
network slice mapper

1531
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,880
which essentially takes the customer

1532
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,160
slice request and

1533
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,559
and process it in order to put into the

1534
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:05,680
overall context

1535
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,839
of the itf network slices being managed

1536
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:09,839
by the by the provider

1537
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,440
and then a second component that was the

1538
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,520
realizer which essentially processed

1539
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,480
that

1540
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,720
information and selected technology the

1541
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,160
proper technology and interact with the

1542
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,520
network controllers

1543
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:23,520
below the nsc so the models that we

1544
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,920
consider in in this draft were the ones

1545
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:27,920
being proposed in within the framework

1546
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,480
of the

1547
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,880
network size design team we have as

1548
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,119
custom initially as customers view the

1549
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,559
the wdt's eitf and network size

1550
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,680
nba young and as provider view the

1551
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:43,119
luts transport network size young

1552
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,480
the models that are below the network

1553
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,160
slice controller that would be the ones

1554
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,599
interacting with the network controllers

1555
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,640
are out of scope of this draft so

1556
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,200
next please

1557
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,839
so the days from the previous version

1558
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,280
essentially

1559
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,400
we mark two those to to accomplish for

1560
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:03,680
the version zero one

1561
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,920
one of them was to add two new sessions

1562
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,079
uh as placeholder for elaborating more

1563
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:08,480
on the

1564
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,319
components that we saw before the mapper

1565
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,520
and the realizer

1566
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,280
we already created these placeholders

1567
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,680
and added some initial

1568
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,119
description for them also something that

1569
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:19,839
was uh

1570
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,760
pending to be resolved for zero one was

1571
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,039
to

1572
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,520
add a mention to the complementarity of

1573
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:26,640
the two models that i

1574
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,520
i mentioned before the wd and the new

1575
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,880
models

1576
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,599
in order to be used as as customer view

1577
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:34,400
models

1578
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,640
the idea behind this would be that the

1579
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,559
the wd model

1580
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,119
could be used once we request a network

1581
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,480
slides which essentially can be

1582
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,000
described as an abstract

1583
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,200
set of h2h links while the new

1584
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,319
the draft essentially would be used to

1585
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,319
request an extra topology of virtual

1586
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,920
nodes and virtual links in case that the

1587
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,680
customer requires

1588
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,799
more view on the slice and also we

1589
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,480
addressed two comments received in

1590
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,799
an itf 109 one from adrian farrell about

1591
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,880
the idea of mapping the type of models

1592
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,240
customer service and network to the

1593
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:09,359
interfaces we

1594
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,400
we go through that in this version and

1595
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,280
also there were

1596
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,760
there was another comment from boris

1597
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,200
kashanov

1598
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,280
asking if the network controller could

1599
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,760
be considered or not part of the logical

1600
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,799
architecture we

1601
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,960
decided to keep yet as part of the

1602
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,000
logical architecture

1603
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,480
because this is what is being i mean to

1604
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,920
make it consistent with the

1605
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,480
definitions and the french draft by now

1606
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,079
consider the network controller

1607
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:38,160
there so next please

1608
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,480
so next step would be to collect

1609
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,000
feedback and comments from the working

1610
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,480
group

1611
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,880
to propose a draft as a great outcome of

1612
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,559
the design team if

1613
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,599
if we get working on the design

1614
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:52,720
in a structure or otherwise we will

1615
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,760
move as a contribution for the group

1616
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,839
and essentially to prepare a new person

1617
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,520
and ask for adoption in

1618
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,039
next meeting if possible so this is all

1619
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,000
from my side

1620
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,839
so there are some questions okay uh i

1621
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,240
think

1622
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,079
uh thank you very much i don't think we

1623
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,760
really have time for much comments

1624
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,799
um doesn't look like anyone's coming

1625
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,160
i'll make the same comment i made on the

1626
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,079
last one if you see parts of this

1627
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,760
document that you think are appropriate

1628
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,760
for the framework document

1629
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,720
now that we have a working group

1630
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,039
document please feel free to propose

1631
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,000
sections on the list for inclusion not

1632
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,359
saying that there you definitely want to

1633
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,319
do that but just consider that

1634
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:35,599
okay thank you and we're going to move

1635
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,760
on

1636
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,680
uh i'm not sure bo

1637
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,200
yes i'm presenting uh okay reza go ahead

1638
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,799
please

1639
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:50,000
uh on behalf of the co-authors this

1640
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,079
is the nbi uh young model but

1641
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,480
the it's very related to the discussion

1642
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,280
that we had

1643
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,000
uh you know half an hour ago go ahead

1644
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,400
next

1645
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,839
slide please

1646
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:08,880
on the left hand side this is the

1647
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,039
picture that uh just uh

1648
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,599
lewis showed you the network a slice

1649
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:14,799
controller has an

1650
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,799
nbi and str the

1651
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,599
component that we did we discussed uh

1652
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:23,920
for this discussion the young model

1653
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:26,960
is the nbi and as a whole the

1654
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,079
nbi model contains

1655
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,160
then be considered as a service the

1656
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,400
upper layer asked for a service for this

1657
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,119
creation of ietf network slice that

1658
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,160
request

1659
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,839
contains the basically

1660
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:44,960
four different major components one is

1661
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,520
the type of the topology which is needed

1662
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,760
you know the 0.21 multipoint multipoint

1663
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,960
and so on

1664
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,680
a group of policy which identifies the

1665
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,920
slo which is required to create that

1666
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,799
network slice

1667
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,520
a group of endpoints which belong or

1668
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,920
whatever terminology will come up

1669
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,880
we will modify this one obviously and

1670
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,400
last but not least

1671
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,440
the link between those endpoints

1672
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,440
how they basically should be connected

1673
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,599
together these are the majority

1674
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,559
of there are some other small uh the

1675
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:19,280
component

1676
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,200
in the young model but these are the

1677
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
four group of the components

1678
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,400
that you will see the in the next slide

1679
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,839
next slide please

1680
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,559
the some changes that has been done

1681
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,319
versus the the last update we

1682
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,319
removed the concept of the connection

1683
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,920
group because

1684
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,359
we felt that we want to be aligned with

1685
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:46,000
the

1686
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,280
the mailing list and basically a single

1687
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,559
entrance as a single itf

1688
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,400
network slice as a service contains only

1689
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,079
one or multiple connection with multiple

1690
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:00,720
slo

1691
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,880
we believe that the connection group is

1692
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,880
was redundant in that model

1693
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,920
to simplify it we remove that the

1694
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,440
discussion about that

1695
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,039
pe or ce facing realization for the

1696
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,880
network slice endpoint

1697
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:17,920
also is added here with a few pictures

1698
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,279
and examples

1699
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,399
and a sample json also included for the

1700
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,000
clarity of the

1701
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,238
discussion next please

1702
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,920
the modeling as a very whole is the

1703
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,080
captured here we have an end-to-end

1704
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,399
network itf network as well should be

1705
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:39,920
created either blue

1706
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,120
or red with various connectivity one of

1707
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,279
them is for example multi-point to point

1708
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,960
another one is the point-to-point

1709
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,238
the whole idea here is if we want to

1710
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,359
model this one the important aspect also

1711
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:53,920
is

1712
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,279
the network that is going to be realized

1713
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:02,319
that this uh ietf network slices

1714
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,920
not necessarily ipmps we can think of as

1715
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,479
a

1716
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:08,880
you know general concept if that network

1717
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:09,520
is

1718
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,560
for example other technology how we can

1719
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,120
come up with the model which captures

1720
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,920
not only

1721
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,640
ip which obviously this is the main

1722
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,158
topic that we have to discuss

1723
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:22,640
but is the extensible in such a way that

1724
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,560
we can extend it to the other type of

1725
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,799
the network the updates or pawn or any

1726
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:27,279
other

1727
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,520
technology that we want to do that one

1728
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,960
so these are the main

1729
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,080
ideas that we consider in the modeling

1730
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,359
to be as generic as possible captures

1731
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:40,238
all the discussion that we have the in

1732
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:41,198
the draft

1733
01:09:41,198 --> 01:09:44,000
definition and the framework and at the

1734
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,198
same time

1735
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,319
bring the clarity to make sure that

1736
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,198
we address all the component which is

1737
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:51,759
needed

1738
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,440
for the modeling of the single iter

1739
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,800
network

1740
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,840
i have only i think one more slide to

1741
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,000
cover

1742
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
you've seen this picture before this is

1743
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,480
not new but the idea here is

1744
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,040
the attribute that nbi has them i guess

1745
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,040
the message of this slide here is

1746
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,360
the attribute which specifies the

1747
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,719
northbound interface

1748
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,040
not all of them are mandatory there are

1749
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,480
lots of attributes which

1750
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,440
are optional and depends on which

1751
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,159
attribute

1752
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:25,760
is given the role of the network uh

1753
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,679
slice controller is to find the best

1754
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:32,080
mapping into the network and depends on

1755
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
the information which is given

1756
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,880
that cotton code best lodging inside the

1757
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,679
controller

1758
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:40,239
will decide what is the best way to

1759
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,640
address and realize it in the network

1760
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,800
from that aspect the attributes that

1761
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,000
you've seen in the

1762
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,199
yang model lots of them are

1763
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,840
optional and if they are given the

1764
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,000
controller is going to take advantage of

1765
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,159
them to find the best

1766
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,199
realization and best c

1767
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:03,040
or p in the network to realize

1768
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:05,840
next please

1769
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,000
uh i can escape this one but the idea

1770
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,400
here is just a quick uh the

1771
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,239
discussion about the service training it

1772
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,080
is possible to do that one but i'm

1773
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,080
encouraging to take a look at the draft

1774
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,040
take a

1775
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,080
look and uh put

1776
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,679
if there is any comment or feedback

1777
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,480
please include in the mailing

1778
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,080
we are the asking for comments on this

1779
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,440
please take a look and uh we are getting

1780
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,719
uh closer to adoption when we converge

1781
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,000
on the

1782
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,040
uh terminology

1783
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,280
we will include that here and in the

1784
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,800
next ietf

1785
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,679
hopefully we reach that agreement for

1786
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,520
other draft and as a result

1787
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,600
we will be very close to have an

1788
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,120
adoption of this one

1789
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,159
as well and that concludes

1790
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,879
my uh presentation any question please

1791
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,280
questions comments i i think there it's

1792
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,239
clear that we're going to need a

1793
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,440
document

1794
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,440
in this space as a working group

1795
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:10,880
document

1796
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,920
so i you know it's good to see that it's

1797
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,199
moving closer

1798
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,840
and when you're ready i think it you can

1799
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,800
ask for

1800
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,920
adoption and we'll move forward if there

1801
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,640
are

1802
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,640
significant cop comments particularly

1803
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,000
objections feel free

1804
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,080
not to wait for the adoption and call

1805
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,800
and send it to the list

1806
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:37,840
sure thank you thank you

1807
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,920
um i'll present that yeah let's go ahead

1808
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,080
yeah this is a young data model draft

1809
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,920
for managing slice policies in

1810
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,600
ip and mpls networks this replaces the

1811
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,840
slice per hop definition yang draft that

1812
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,360
was on the teas agenda

1813
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,360
in ietf 109. the renaming was done to be

1814
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,880
consistent with the terminology

1815
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,640
introduced

1816
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,640
in the best parties in this packet draft

1817
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,960
that tarek earlier presented

1818
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,480
again my name is pawan biram and i'm

1819
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,000
presenting this on behalf of the folks

1820
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,120
listed on this slide

1821
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,800
next slide

1822
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,600
um like tariq mentioned the slice policy

1823
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,679
is a policy construct whose enforcement

1824
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,360
results in the creation of a slice

1825
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,080
aggregate

1826
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,560
uh tarak already covered what a slice

1827
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,520
aggregators and

1828
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,920
how a slice policy can be used to

1829
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,239
instantiate a slice aggregates or not

1830
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,640
reiterate all of those mechanics but

1831
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,600
i'll just focus

1832
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,440
the narrative in this deck on the

1833
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,800
modeling aspects

1834
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:42,400
so depending on how the shared network

1835
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,000
resources are partitioned there are

1836
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:44,719
three

1837
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,480
different slice policy modes that can

1838
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,400
come into play uh

1839
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,719
a is where the partitioning of the share

1840
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:51,679
network resources

1841
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:54,080
is achieved in just the data plane b is

1842
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,840
where the partitioning can be achieved

1843
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,360
in just the control plane

1844
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,040
and c is where the partitioning can be

1845
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,560
achieved in both the control and data

1846
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,199
planes

1847
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,800
and in the modes where the partitioning

1848
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,320
of the share network resources is

1849
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,760
achieved in the data plane

1850
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,920
the forwarding engine on each

1851
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,120
participating node

1852
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,080
is required to identify the traffic

1853
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,400
belonging to a specific slice aggregate

1854
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,159
and apply the corresponding perhaps

1855
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:17,760
behavior and that's why we call it

1856
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,640
uh based on diffser principles right so

1857
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,000
the identification of the slice

1858
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,640
aggregate

1859
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,000
and the corresponding forwarding

1860
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,560
treatment uh that's dictated by the

1861
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,000
slice policy and you will see

1862
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,080
that captured in the model proposed in

1863
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,120
this document

1864
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,640
in the modes where the partitioning of

1865
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,320
the share network resources is achieved

1866
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,600
in the control plane

1867
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,920
uh the distributed or centralized

1868
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,600
resource reservation manager

1869
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,440
is required to manage slice aggregate

1870
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,800
resource reservation

1871
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,199
and the provisions for enabling that are

1872
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:47,040
dictated by the slice policy and you

1873
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:47,360
will

1874
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,920
see that as well captured in this model

1875
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,679
and lastly in all the three modes

1876
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,719
uh you do require the topology

1877
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,480
associated with the slice aggregate to

1878
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,040
be

1879
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,199
specified in some manner the rules for

1880
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,880
determining which topological elements

1881
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,320
cater to the slice aggregate

1882
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
are dictated by the slice policy and

1883
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,000
you'll also see that captured in the

1884
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,120
model

1885
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,679
this new renamed version is consistent

1886
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,040
with the terminology used

1887
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,480
in the two network slicing design team

1888
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,840
drafts and

1889
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:18,960
the best bar draft that tariq

1890
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,440
had earlier presented we had some great

1891
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,040
feedback come in for this since the last

1892
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,480
itf and

1893
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,239
we believe we have incorporated all of

1894
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,679
that in this version

1895
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,159
next slide

1896
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,760
this is the high level model structure

1897
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,199
as you would expect the top level

1898
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:38,000
container has a list of slice policies

1899
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
in addition to this there is a list of

1900
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,159
phps and a list of topology filters that

1901
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:44,000
are referenced by the slice policies

1902
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
it is structured this way to allow

1903
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,320
multiple slice aggregates to use

1904
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,840
the same php or the same topology next

1905
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,840
slide

1906
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,120
this is a list of the php entries each

1907
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,040
entry can be referenced by one or more

1908
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,159
slice policies

1909
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,159
it can either carry a reference to a

1910
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,320
generic ph profile that is already

1911
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,440
available on the node

1912
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,320
or it can carry a custom php profile

1913
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:08,880
this is

1914
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,640
a bit similar to how the l3 vpn or l3 sm

1915
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,199
model

1916
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:16,080
l3 vpn model rather has been modeled

1917
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,559
next slide

1918
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,239
this is a list of topology filters each

1919
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:23,920
entry can be referenced by one or more

1920
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,800
specific

1921
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,280
one or more slice policies each entry

1922
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,040
could either reference a predefined

1923
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,120
topology or specify the rules to

1924
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,280
construct a customized topology

1925
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:35,120
so for predefined topology you can

1926
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,320
either i mean we have a couple of

1927
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,760
options here you can either reference a

1928
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,320
combination of algo id and empty id

1929
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,679
uh if if if you want to use flex i'll go

1930
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:46,320
of topology

1931
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:48,960
that's the way to go uh the other option

1932
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,719
is to reference a set of key topology

1933
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:51,920
identifiers

1934
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,760
uh with respect to construct rules for

1935
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,600
constructing customized topology we have

1936
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,560
a set of

1937
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,239
include any include all and exclude

1938
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:03,040
filters next slide

1939
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,760
uh this is a list of slice policies uh

1940
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,280
there are four key elements in a slice

1941
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:08,159
policy

1942
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,800
uh and uh the next few slides will go

1943
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,400
over

1944
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,480
what what those are next slide

1945
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,400
uh first up is the resource reservation

1946
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,640
container this carries uh

1947
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,199
data nodes that are required for uh

1948
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:24,320
bandwidth engineering

1949
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,760
slice aggregate aware bandwidth

1950
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,719
engineering uh next slide

1951
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:33,199
uh the slice selectors container carries

1952
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:35,440
a set of ip and mpls data plane field

1953
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,400
selectors

1954
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,400
which are used to identify the packets

1955
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,120
belonging to a given slice aggregate

1956
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,640
each entry in the list has an index

1957
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,000
associated with it the one with the

1958
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,280
lowest index is the one

1959
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,840
used by default by all the topological

1960
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,120
elements that are members of the given

1961
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,800
slice policy typically you will find

1962
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,440
only

1963
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,480
one slice selector of use to be present

1964
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,520
but

1965
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,840
if the other entries are present they i

1966
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,199
mean they come into play only when there

1967
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:01,120
is a need to override the default slice

1968
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,560
selector

1969
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,040
next slide

1970
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:09,600
this is uh the ph belief is a reference

1971
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,199
to the php that needs to be applied for

1972
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,120
the given slice aggregate

1973
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,199
unless specified otherwise this is the

1974
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:17,199
php to be used by default by all the

1975
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,719
topological elements

1976
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:20,880
of the given slice policy the

1977
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:21,920
penultimate slide

1978
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,400
next slide

1979
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,840
this consists of a list of member

1980
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,000
topologies and is used to determine

1981
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,760
uh the topology associated with the

1982
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,840
slice aggregate uh as you can see you

1983
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:35,440
can have multiple topology filters

1984
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,280
referenced by the same slice policy in

1985
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,880
that case the union of the topology

1986
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,719
filters will give you the topology

1987
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,960
associated with the slice aggregate the

1988
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,640
topological elements that satisfy the

1989
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,920
membership criteria

1990
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,040
also have the ability to optionally

1991
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:49,760
override

1992
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,760
the default php or the default slice

1993
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,360
selector and that's captured here

1994
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,080
last slide please

1995
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,840
next slide um we understand that the

1996
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,199
working group adoption will take due

1997
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,040
course and a lot depends on how the

1998
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,640
framework draft shapes up in the coming

1999
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,679
weeks we would like

2000
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,920
a few terms to be incorporated in the

2001
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,800
framework

2002
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,640
uh but that said the authors do believe

2003
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,400
that the slice policy model is an

2004
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,000
essential construct to realize the

2005
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,360
slacks aggregate

2006
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,199
and we do believe that it's sufficiently

2007
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,040
baked and ready to progress to the next

2008
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:19,600
step

2009
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,920
whenever it's deemed to do so in the

2010
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,440
meantime we request

2011
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:24,640
those of you who haven't checked this

2012
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,440
model out to go through it review it and

2013
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,320
send in your comments

2014
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:37,280
questions comments we have one in queue

2015
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:40,400
please go ahead uh

2016
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,960
hello power can you hear me hi robin

2017
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,159
yeah

2018
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,280
hi uh i'm uh i'm a little confused

2019
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,199
about this the young models because i

2020
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:53,520
think that's the young models depending

2021
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,120
on the

2022
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,440
implementation of the control plane and

2023
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,679
the forwarding plane

2024
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,199
but until now there's not the

2025
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,120
protocol extensions for the control

2026
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,280
plane and the forwarding plane

2027
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,040
are not determined so how we

2028
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,800
can go with these young models

2029
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,199
uh i mean ideally i would like to start

2030
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:18,000
with the data model

2031
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,639
first and then worry about uh the

2032
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:22,320
extensions the control plane

2033
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,239
extension that you're talking about if

2034
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,480
as a working group we believe that

2035
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,960
we require uh this construct called a

2036
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,159
slice aggregate

2037
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,360
and i believe vtn is also being

2038
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,080
positioned

2039
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,400
as a slice aggregate and i would like to

2040
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,760
think that is a construct that's

2041
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:38,560
required

2042
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,239
then it's just a question of how we go

2043
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,040
about uh realizing or instantiating the

2044
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,320
slice aggregate right

2045
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,560
and we are positioning the slice policy

2046
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,520
as a

2047
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,840
construct to help instantiate the slice

2048
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:50,639
aggregate

2049
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:53,360
and once we uh get some consensus with

2050
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,239
regards to that

2051
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:57,600
then getting uh getting the igp

2052
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,639
extensions

2053
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,639
to do uh things like slice aggregate

2054
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,400
away tea or

2055
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,880
some extensions to cover uh flex algo

2056
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,920
those those are

2057
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,280
trivial activities in my head in

2058
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,360
getting the data model is the key first

2059
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,440
step before we uh

2060
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,760
worry about the igp extensions that

2061
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,239
would be my take

2062
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:21,040
a quick question quick comments why not

2063
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,400
information model first

2064
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,719
these are also two concrete yeah that's

2065
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,480
that's a good way of stalling progress

2066
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,360
but yeah i mean

2067
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:32,480
uh we we have uh we have produced

2068
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:33,920
multiple data models in this working

2069
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,520
group without having to produce an

2070
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,639
information model

2071
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,400
but if somebody wants to take a stab at

2072
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,159
it uh yeah they

2073
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:43,520
they are welcome to do so

2074
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,440
into the list so this topic's out of

2075
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,199
time and

2076
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:56,960
um i think you're presenting next

2077
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,199
uh hello uh i will present this on

2078
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:02,239
behalf of your song

2079
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,440
can you hear me yeah go ahead

2080
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,800
okay okay this is and i'm going to

2081
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:13,040
the presentation on this 5g end-to-end

2082
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:14,560
network slice mapping

2083
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,080
topic on behalf of all these co-authors

2084
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,159
okay please

2085
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,199
okay uh in the uh

2086
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,719
context of 5g end and angle slicing

2087
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:32,000
it is basically composed of three major

2088
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,560
segments of technical domains and in

2089
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,440
this

2090
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:39,120
uh term call the ietf network slice is

2091
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,840
uh

2092
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,400
called like a transparent network slice

2093
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,120
so this

2094
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,960
just to show that the transport slides

2095
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,320
and transport network

2096
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,360
is a context either term used in the end

2097
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,440
and resulting context and they are

2098
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:54,000
correspond to the itf network slides

2099
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,320
in the nitro slice definition draft

2100
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,360
okay here we list all the natural size

2101
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,120
uh

2102
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:09,040
identifications which may be used for in

2103
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,960
the 5g entrance slicing

2104
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,280
uh some of these terms like the network

2105
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,239
slice instance

2106
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,600
and the ice subnet instance

2107
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,480
were introduced by 3gpp and

2108
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,600
correspondingly

2109
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,920
for the transport network we introduced

2110
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,239
the tn ssis for the

2111
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:29,440
transport network slide subnet and

2112
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,520
for the network slides mapping between

2113
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,159
the 5g engine slides to the

2114
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:37,760
transport network slides to another term

2115
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,199
called the transport nanoslice

2116
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:41,440
interworking identifier is used

2117
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,159
to describe this mapping relationship

2118
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:45,040
and

2119
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,440
it also to represent the data plane

2120
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,199
calculations used for this

2121
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,920
mapping on the interface for the

2122
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,840
connection between the transport network

2123
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,199
and the ram and the

2124
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,920
network inside the transport network

2125
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,000
itself there may be another

2126
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,080
identifier we use the term here the

2127
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,239
transport network slice identifier to

2128
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:04,880
represent

2129
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,000
this concept which is internally used

2130
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,080
in the transport network and it is uh

2131
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,239
different from can be different from the

2132
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:16,000
mapping relationship identifier

2133
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,360
used for in the transport network slice

2134
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:24,239
interconnection okay next page

2135
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:28,960
okay this page gives an overview of the

2136
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,880
5g end-to-end network slides

2137
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,000
mapping and all the in the different

2138
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,719
planes in the for example the management

2139
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:38,400
plane the control plane and the data

2140
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,280
plane

2141
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:42,400
for the management plane the entrance

2142
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,320
management function is responsible for

2143
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,840
the end-to-end slice creation

2144
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:47,600
and to maintain the relation mapping

2145
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,880
relationship between the

2146
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,480
different uh subdomain slice identifiers

2147
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,080
uh in the access in access in the

2148
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,480
transport and this core network

2149
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,880
and in the car network uh in the control

2150
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,840
plane there's

2151
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,360
uh as as i say i used for the

2152
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,800
uh establishment of the 5g network

2153
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,520
slides

2154
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,920
between the access network and the car

2155
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:13,199
core network

2156
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,520
well the transfer network country is not

2157
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,280
aware of this kind of

2158
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,960
signaling context

2159
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,760
in the data plane this is what we need

2160
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,440
for the transport network slice

2161
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:28,320
into working identifier it is called to

2162
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,600
identify the

2163
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,760
entrance slice mapping relationship to

2164
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,159
the transfer network slice

2165
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:36,320
so this is what we will talk about more

2166
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,719
in the next page

2167
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,840
okay next page

2168
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,440
in this one for the transport natural

2169
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,159
slice

2170
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:49,440
interaction there are several data plane

2171
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,199
options

2172
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:53,440
which can be used as an identifier of

2173
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,280
the transport network slides

2174
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:58,719
into action here we list

2175
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,000
some of the options uh one typical

2176
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,520
encapsulation is

2177
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,000
using the wheeler id for the network

2178
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,080
slice mapping from the end-to-end slides

2179
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,000
to the transformer slice

2180
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,480
well we also have listed the other

2181
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,120
options

2182
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:16,159
and give some analysis about the options

2183
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:19,280
in different layers for example the

2184
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,480
layer 3 options

2185
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,760
and also some possible

2186
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,960
options in upper layers

2187
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:30,000
okay next page

2188
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,000
here are the what we have updated in

2189
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:36,480
this

2190
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,120
latest version uh basically we add some

2191
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:39,600
uh

2192
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,719
add a reference to the uh northbound

2193
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,679
interface young model and we clarify the

2194
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:47,760
relationship between slice mapping and

2195
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,880
the qs mapping basically they can be

2196
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,960
seen as independent behaviors on

2197
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,440
further is we detail the specification

2198
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,159
of the tnsii based on some comments

2199
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:05,600
it's just a new concept for uh to ease

2200
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,639
the description

2201
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,520
in this context uh well it it can be

2202
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,840
instantiated with either existing data

2203
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,920
plane identifiers like a vlan id

2204
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,199
or some other ids it does not have to be

2205
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:20,400
a new encapsulation

2206
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:23,440
well uh it can be pre-allocated as a

2207
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,960
global identifier or

2208
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,400
it can also be used as a local

2209
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,000
identifier

2210
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,880
okay next page

2211
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,400
so uh the reason we present this work

2212
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,800
here

2213
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,920
is uh we think we notice a lot of

2214
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,280
interest from operators

2215
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,320
who have uh research concerns about

2216
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,719
how to realize the end-to-end slash

2217
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:45,520
deployment

2218
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:49,199
and the mapping is one important

2219
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:52,719
technology used in this to achieve this

2220
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,239
so we think the topic really needs

2221
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:59,520
more discussion and the

2222
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,199
appreciate more comments and

2223
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,760
contributions from the booking group

2224
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,000
also perhaps we need some further

2225
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,120
cooperation

2226
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:09,280
between the itf and also the 3gpp on

2227
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,840
this topic

2228
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,840
that's all

2229
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:20,400
any questions

2230
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,840
i think that's a lot of interest from

2231
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,840
this topic i think one of the ways to do

2232
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:34,560
this

2233
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,639
ig interactions a lot of for this

2234
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:37,760
community

2235
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,280
i work in the dmm group so so if you see

2236
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,800
there is a working group right after

2237
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,199
draft so see the delta what is the extra

2238
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:46,719
things need to be done

2239
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:48,480
maybe it's a it's a good idea to bring

2240
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,719
it to the dmm working group

2241
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:52,480
especially for the 5g interactions so a

2242
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,000
lot of delegates participate there so

2243
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,840
it's a good time to get the feedback

2244
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,000
yeah yeah actually we're open to which

2245
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,440
working group this

2246
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:07,040
draft belongs to and maybe

2247
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,679
we can ask about the chairs opinion on

2248
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,840
this

2249
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:29,280
hello

2250
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,520
maybe we can take that discussion flying

2251
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,800
about which smoking group

2252
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:43,600
we should have that kind of discussion

2253
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:52,320
yeah let's let's take that offline uh

2254
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:55,199
no if which is not here i can present on

2255
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,839
his behalf

2256
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,360
but if you wish you can you can go on

2257
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:07,440
anyways

2258
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:10,400
should i start then

2259
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:13,840
okay so let me present this this new

2260
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,600
draft which is about the instantiation

2261
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,800
of itf

2262
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,320
network slices in service provider

2263
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,000
networks on behalf of all my my

2264
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,120
co-authors here in the in the front page

2265
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,840
so next please

2266
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:29,360
so the motivation was essentially to to

2267
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:30,800
answer or to

2268
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,719
to target the question that you can see

2269
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,080
at the bottom of the slide

2270
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,239
so how to instantiate an itf network

2271
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:37,199
slides

2272
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:39,199
considering the variety of potential sdn

2273
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,960
implementations that we could

2274
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:42,960
face or we could find in service

2275
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,880
provider networks for that we

2276
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,719
look at the different assets that we

2277
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:48,080
have in

2278
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,719
in the work of itf so essentially a

2279
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:51,920
number of

2280
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,400
data models that are being developed for

2281
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,320
the different purposes so service data

2282
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:57,520
models

2283
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,840
network models t models including the

2284
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,560
mapping of

2285
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,840
services to the tunnels

2286
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:07,440
acls routing policies and so on so far

2287
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,679
also taking into consideration the

2288
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:10,639
outcomes from the

2289
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,960
design team in terms of the definition

2290
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,080
and framework

2291
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,639
documents certain understanding to see

2292
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:17,840
what could be the

2293
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,920
the expected uh behavior of the network

2294
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,040
slice controller

2295
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,280
i'm finally looking for consistency with

2296
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,159
some other

2297
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,800
uh outcomes from from atf essentially

2298
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:27,679
the frameworks that

2299
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:31,440
have been defined in nfc 8969

2300
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,800
for automating service and network

2301
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,560
management and also it

2302
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:37,040
fourth five three for the ectn the

2303
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,040
structure and control of te networks so

2304
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,040
essentially looking at all of them and

2305
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,040
trying to understand how they could fit

2306
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:46,239
how what could make use of all of this

2307
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:47,840
for the different deployment scenarios

2308
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,600
that we could find in service provider

2309
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,440
networks in sdn

2310
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:54,239
so next please

2311
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,960
so one starting point was also to

2312
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:00,639
to see what could be the essentially the

2313
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:02,480
requirements for those slices so we

2314
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,159
depart from the work that is being done

2315
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:06,880
in draft contrastis slice mbi

2316
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,560
reporting a number of use cases and a

2317
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,040
number of attributes that should be

2318
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:13,120
supported by expected to be supported by

2319
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,800
the network slices

2320
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,360
uh here we took an example of the 5g

2321
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,520
service but well the idea would be

2322
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:22,239
to uh from all the attributes that are

2323
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,320
being reported in that other draft

2324
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:26,480
to have a summary of what could be let's

2325
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,920
say the the

2326
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,840
general attributes not the specific per

2327
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,520
service but uh

2328
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,920
being comprehensive comprehensive for

2329
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,360
all the services expected

2330
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,360
but just for an example because this is

2331
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,400
an ongoing

2332
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,800
work so we took the some of them for

2333
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,239
instance for the 5g

2334
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,320
the availability of the downlink

2335
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,560
throughput for registration purposes

2336
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:48,239
so really availability for instance

2337
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,080
nowadays we don't have a

2338
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,199
gen data model that could support the as

2339
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,320
it is stated in the in the fight

2340
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,480
use case so that the availability of the

2341
01:32:58,480 --> 01:32:59,520
dimension we

2342
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,320
could make use of uh some capabilities

2343
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:02,880
on

2344
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,960
existing young data models for

2345
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,719
requesting tunnels of path with

2346
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:08,239
different resiliency

2347
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:09,760
requirements in terms of protection or

2348
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,360
restoration for instance so we could

2349
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:12,080
play

2350
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,520
with that going as another example with

2351
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,280
the throughput maybe we could leverage

2352
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,920
on what is being done in the bpm models

2353
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,679
that essentially try to specify a

2354
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,760
bandwidth a given bandwidth between the

2355
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,480
interface

2356
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:27,360
uh between the slice and the customer or

2357
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,440
even going to the t models for

2358
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:32,159
uh ensuring a certain bandwidth between

2359
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:32,800
the

2360
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,040
pe's for for the service so these are

2361
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,320
just examples of what

2362
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:39,440
is the work that we are doing next

2363
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,080
slide please

2364
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,360
so once we understand the requirements

2365
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:46,960
and and the needs the

2366
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,199
idea would be how we could play with the

2367
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,480
different

2368
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,120
data models in order to realize the

2369
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,719
service so we we

2370
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:57,440
foresee three options by now so this we

2371
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,520
we acknowledge that we need to refine it

2372
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:00,800
but right now we identify three

2373
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,560
different options the first option would

2374
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,320
be to have a hierarchical network

2375
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,199
controller

2376
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,440
that has some other network controllers

2377
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,480
above

2378
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:10,719
and essentially the in this first option

2379
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:12,320
we could consider that the network size

2380
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:13,440
controller is part

2381
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,000
of this hierarchical network controller

2382
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:16,960
so

2383
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,239
in this case for instance the slice

2384
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:20,800
request could come from the draft wd

2385
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:21,199
that

2386
01:34:21,199 --> 01:34:24,400
was uh presented before and

2387
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,760
we could expect in the southbound

2388
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:27,440
interface of this hierarchical network

2389
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,239
controller

2390
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:31,440
to make use of the network models layer

2391
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,360
2 or layer 3 for instance

2392
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:36,080
so the idea here would be to trying to

2393
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,280
map the different

2394
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:39,679
attributes and see how we could realize

2395
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:40,480
uh this

2396
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:43,600
leveraging on this network model so

2397
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,320
now linking with a structure that we saw

2398
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,280
before as well

2399
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,400
proposed for the neighborhoods

2400
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,560
controller we will have a first exercise

2401
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,000
that would be the mapping

2402
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,560
of this customer request a customer

2403
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,320
slice request

2404
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,119
using this other graph and then

2405
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:00,080
finalizing

2406
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:04,239
mapping to these network models so

2407
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:06,000
the realization could be the translation

2408
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,840
to one or more of this

2409
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,320
enabled model request and the network on

2410
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,560
slice controller essentially we need to

2411
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,880
complete the we need to have a complete

2412
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,239
view of the network map

2413
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:19,119
in order to have a clear mapping of in

2414
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,719
which parts of the network to apply the

2415
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:21,920
configuration

2416
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:24,960
and then realize the slides including

2417
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,719
the selection of recording policies

2418
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:29,040
routing policies bpm policies

2419
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,480
or unfor sure under

2420
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,880
selecting the underlying transport

2421
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,159
network for realizing

2422
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:38,639
respected slice from the customer

2423
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,000
perspective

2424
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,920
next please a second implementation

2425
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,600
option could be

2426
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,960
something similar to what has been

2427
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,719
defined in the definitions and framework

2428
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:49,199
drafts

2429
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,520
so to have a network size controller

2430
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:52,239
that has

2431
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:54,560
below a number of enabled controllers in

2432
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:56,320
this case maybe we could consider that

2433
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,679
this laser request

2434
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:59,920
comes from the draft view that would be

2435
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,440
the outcome from the mapper

2436
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,400
and enter into the realizer component so

2437
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,480
we highlight it here in this way

2438
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,280
and again we would have a in the salvo

2439
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,480
interface from the network size

2440
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,280
controller

2441
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:13,520
a map into a network model one of the

2442
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:15,360
network models either layer two ladder

2443
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,239
three

2444
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:17,840
here again the the idea would be

2445
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,520
essentially the same for mapping and for

2446
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,440
realizing so the need of having the

2447
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,320
complete

2448
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,600
uh view of the of the network in the

2449
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,600
network size controller and also to

2450
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,520
realize including forwarding policy

2451
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,239
routing policies and so on so far

2452
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:34,799
next please

2453
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:39,840
and the final uh option that we do for c

2454
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,239
by now would be to have a

2455
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:45,199
a network controller that incorporates

2456
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:46,960
the network size controller and

2457
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:48,159
essentially we could have

2458
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,600
on the node one interface of this

2459
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,760
network controller

2460
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,400
and as a service request for instance a

2461
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,000
layer two

2462
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,880
layer two vpn or larger three vpn that

2463
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,320
is realized

2464
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,239
uh by a network slice so essentially we

2465
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:04,480
do

2466
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:08,000
we have a letter cbpn be mapped and be

2467
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,159
unrealized in a network slice

2468
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:14,159
so next on final slide please

2469
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,560
so conclusions uh there is a wide

2470
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,920
variety of

2471
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,760
models currently being progressing in

2472
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,760
itf some of the

2473
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,239
slice requirements could be satisfied or

2474
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,080
by these models probably some others not

2475
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,119
so this is uh

2476
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:29,199
something that is a we need to look at

2477
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:30,960
that in order to ensure

2478
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,000
a straight straightforward um

2479
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,760
realization of what is being requested

2480
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,360
in the norway interface

2481
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,760
um and a more detailed definition for

2482
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:40,560
those uncover

2483
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,400
requirements is needed so this is work

2484
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,320
in progress next step

2485
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
from our side is to keep working on on

2486
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,760
detailing the different implementation

2487
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,520
options we identified these three but

2488
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,320
we need to refine this is clear collect

2489
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,080
feed.com comments from the working group

2490
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,320
and prepare a new version for next itf

2491
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,759
and that's all from my side thank you so

2492
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,480
much

2493
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,519
next presentation

2494
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,840
thanks

2495
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,759
fang are you a presenter

2496
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,320
hello hello yeah

2497
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,000
hello everyone can hear it yeah

2498
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:33,040
we can go ahead yeah hello everyone

2499
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:36,320
i came from cmcc and i'm going to share

2500
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,280
this topic

2501
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,520
on behalf of ray chang-chan thank you

2502
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,639
the topic name is itf network slides use

2503
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,800
cases

2504
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,920
next page please

2505
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,000
first this slides is about the

2506
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,280
modification

2507
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,520
the itf network slice definition

2508
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,760
describes a number of use cases

2509
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,480
benefiting from the network slicing

2510
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,920
and also it clearly states services that

2511
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,040
might benefit from the network slides

2512
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,679
they include but not limited to the

2513
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:12,080
above

2514
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:15,679
use cases and this document

2515
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:18,159
supplements two cases from the

2516
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:21,360
perspective of the operators

2517
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,679
so in general it's a supplement to the

2518
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:25,280
itf network slice

2519
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:30,080
definition next page please

2520
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:34,639
this page shows the two use cases in

2521
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,400
this draft

2522
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:39,199
the first one is the end-to-end slicing

2523
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,239
cloud network

2524
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:43,040
collaboration and the second one is the

2525
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:45,840
branch departments that use slices

2526
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,520
within the operator

2527
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,760
and the detail will be introduced in the

2528
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,520
next slide

2529
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,840
so next slides please

2530
01:39:57,199 --> 01:40:01,360
the first use case as the picture shows

2531
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,560
there are several domains man

2532
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:09,040
edge cloud ip backbone and dc domains

2533
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:11,360
and they are controlled by their own

2534
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,920
controllers

2535
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,000
all the controllers are contacted with

2536
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,119
the higher level operation systems

2537
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:21,960
such as the e3 network slice

2538
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:24,960
orchestrators

2539
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,719
all these domains need to be co already

2540
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:31,199
needed in order to deliver a cloud

2541
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:34,159
network's license for enterprise

2542
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:37,440
so for example in figure in this figure

2543
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,800
the network operator has created two e2e

2544
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,960
network slices

2545
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,199
so there are two types of traffic from

2546
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:46,960
the client and each traffic

2547
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,920
is mapped to different slides which is

2548
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,159
an

2549
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:55,119
sy and an s2 each nice with its own

2550
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:58,239
man at cloud happy backbone and

2551
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:01,679
dc network slices

2552
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:04,880
so this mechanism new should be used

2553
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:08,080
to establish network slices

2554
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,280
in different domains

2555
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,760
that's all for this page please next

2556
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,159
page

2557
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:21,199
um this slides describes the second use

2558
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,400
case the branch department that uses

2559
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:28,239
slices within the operator

2560
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:31,119
in the first picture there are multiple

2561
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,000
sub company

2562
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,040
network a b and

2563
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:40,159
n and there is an ip backbone network

2564
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:42,480
they are all in the same operator ip

2565
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,040
network

2566
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:47,840
similar to the first use case they are

2567
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,920
also controlled by their own slice

2568
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,119
controller

2569
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:54,560
and the ip backbone network need to

2570
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,600
be coordinated with the sub company

2571
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,320
in order to control and calculate the

2572
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,360
energy underpass

2573
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,440
so the information related to the epi

2574
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,679
backbone are sent to the ip backbone

2575
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,280
network slice controller

2576
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:17,520
and the next picture shows the detail

2577
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,679
about the use cases

2578
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,880
from this picture you can see that

2579
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,080
user rights network resources and some

2580
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,360
network resources

2581
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,159
can be allocated from four different

2582
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:31,199
users

2583
01:42:31,199 --> 01:42:35,599
through the role-based rest management

2584
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,880
so this is the second use cases

2585
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:43,840
in this chapter next slide please

2586
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:48,159
oh this is uh this slides the

2587
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:52,560
appended uh the resource management

2588
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:55,040
the network slides resource management

2589
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,080
for the second use cases

2590
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,119
so there are slice id node id as a

2591
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:02,080
policy color

2592
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:06,800
within name and the vlan sub interfaces

2593
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:10,239
it's just a appendage

2594
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:14,560
so next slice please

2595
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,440
oh that's all that's all for this draft

2596
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,040
any comments

2597
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,639
will be welcome thank you

2598
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:27,119
thanks frank

2599
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,679
don't see anybody queueing up uh we can

2600
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:34,480
skip jump to the next one

2601
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,520
lewis do you do you have a question

2602
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,600
yes i have a short question just to

2603
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,520
reflect the point that in the

2604
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,679
there is another draft the draft control

2605
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:44,960
has this npi

2606
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:46,639
which is documenting a number of use

2607
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,480
cases with trying to identify the

2608
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,280
attributes that

2609
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,400
i refer before so probably would be

2610
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,639
good to to check that and to see that

2611
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,880
the use cases here reflected are covered

2612
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:57,199
by

2613
01:43:57,199 --> 01:44:00,639
that overdraft okay please take it take

2614
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:02,239
that to the list

2615
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:07,839
g you're up next

2616
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,800
g

2617
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,080
can you hear me now yes you can yeah

2618
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:18,800
good

2619
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,199
okay hello everyone this is jaydon i'm

2620
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:22,480
going to present this

2621
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:24,480
scalability considerations for the

2622
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,760
enhanced vpn

2623
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:28,480
on behalf of the co-authors next slide

2624
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,718
please

2625
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:34,480
i have some background with the vpnplus

2626
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,600
framework as

2627
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,080
described in the enhancement draft which

2628
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:38,639
is

2629
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:40,800
adopted two years ago in the caseworking

2630
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,560
group it is

2631
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,719
described as layered architecture and

2632
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:46,320
the technologies to provide the weapon

2633
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,520
plus services

2634
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:49,600
and one typical use case is the network

2635
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:51,280
slices

2636
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,320
and then vtn the term

2637
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,440
is basically described a virtual

2638
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,960
underlay network with a

2639
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,840
customized topology and also a set of

2640
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,880
dedicated or shared network resources

2641
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,639
as shown in this figure we can create

2642
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,040
multiple vtns based on a shared physical

2643
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:09,600
network

2644
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,840
and each can be used as a virtual

2645
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,159
underlay to carry one or group of vpn

2646
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:16,000
plus services

2647
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,080
with the demand for the vpn plus service

2648
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,320
increases scalability becomes more and

2649
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:21,760
more important

2650
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,159
in the solution design and deployment so

2651
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:24,960
this document

2652
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:27,360
gives an analysis about the scalability

2653
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,159
of the input

2654
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:30,639
service in terms of the control and the

2655
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:31,280
data plan

2656
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:36,400
scalability mechanisms and optimizations

2657
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:39,280
okay next page

2658
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:44,080
since the typical use case of a vpn plus

2659
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,800
is to deliver the itf network slices

2660
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,639
we think the number of the network

2661
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,719
slices needed would reflect the

2662
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,679
requirements on the vpn plus service

2663
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:56,880
in this figure we give some possible

2664
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:59,199
scenarios of the network slice

2665
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:01,679
and the typical numbers expected for

2666
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:02,800
each case

2667
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:05,119
we can see for different scenarios there

2668
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:07,360
can be different numbers we expected

2669
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:11,600
from 10 to 100 and to 1000 or even more

2670
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,679
so for the solution we need to meet the

2671
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:15,040
requirements of different

2672
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:18,400
scenarios uh from the initial

2673
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:20,719
deployment a solution for us relatively

2674
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:21,760
small number of

2675
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,679
the vpn plus or vpns can be used

2676
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:27,760
well a high scalable solution is needed

2677
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,920
to ensure the massive deployment in the

2678
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,360
future

2679
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:34,320
okay next page

2680
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,119
okay for the control plane scalability

2681
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:39,840
with list

2682
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,400
several aspects which can need to be

2683
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,760
considered

2684
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,400
including the number of protocol

2685
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,400
instances needed and the number of

2686
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:51,280
sessions number of routes advertised

2687
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,679
number of attributes associated with

2688
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,000
each route also the number of the

2689
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,199
routing computation

2690
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:59,840
such as the spf computation executed on

2691
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,320
the nodes

2692
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:04,400
in addition to the distributed control

2693
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,639
plane the centralized controller may

2694
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:08,560
also have some concern in this

2695
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,280
aspect and because of the load on the

2696
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,560
communication channels and

2697
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,800
the processing burden for the global

2698
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,560
compensation

2699
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,840
may increase as the number of the vts

2700
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,080
increases

2701
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,639
next page

2702
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,560
for the control plane optimization we

2703
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,199
proposed

2704
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,760
several approaches in this document the

2705
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,320
first is we can use a shared protocol

2706
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,719
instance on protocol session for the

2707
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:38,239
information distribution

2708
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:41,440
of multiple returns as shown in this

2709
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,560
figure we can create

2710
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,840
one igp instance using igp adjacency for

2711
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,679
the distribution of multiple vtn

2712
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:48,719
information

2713
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:50,960
this can avoid overhead of increase the

2714
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:54,159
number of the instances and sessions

2715
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:58,239
and the second approach is

2716
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,320
we can decouple the advertisement and

2717
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,760
processing of different type of

2718
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,040
attributes of the btn

2719
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,040
for example the topology topology

2720
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,880
attribute and the resource attribute can

2721
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:07,679
be

2722
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:11,119
distributed and present we can

2723
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:13,119
for example we can create multiple vtns

2724
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:15,199
which have can share the same topology

2725
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:15,679
so that

2726
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,960
they can share the computation of spf

2727
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,639
computation this can also reduce

2728
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:22,960
overhead in the control plane

2729
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,040
for the centralized controller that can

2730
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,239
we can just

2731
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,960
use in hybrid mode to divide the

2732
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,080
computational load

2733
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,679
to the centralized controller and also

2734
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,239
the distributed control plane

2735
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:37,199
okay next page

2736
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,199
well this data plane scalability we

2737
01:48:41,199 --> 01:48:42,719
think

2738
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:44,719
basically we need some identification

2739
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:46,000
information to be carried

2740
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,560
into the data packet so that the nodes

2741
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:49,360
can

2742
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,679
perform the vtn specific packet

2743
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:53,840
processing and forwarding

2744
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,760
while the different options of carrying

2745
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,119
this information

2746
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:58,880
can have different scalability

2747
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,800
implications

2748
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,119
the first option is we may choose to

2749
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:04,880
reuse existing fields in the

2750
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,520
package to identify vtn there are

2751
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,920
several examples

2752
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,960
like seeds addresses and existing

2753
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,599
labels the process we don't need to

2754
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:17,760
introduce new fields to the data packet

2755
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,760
while the cons is we may change the

2756
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:21,840
semantics of the existing fields

2757
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,320
the processing behavior may be changed

2758
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,840
and the scalability of these

2759
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,560
existing identifiers may be changed

2760
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:30,560
another option is we can introduce a

2761
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,400
dedicated field in the data packet to

2762
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:33,040
carry

2763
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:35,920
the waiting id for example we can use

2764
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,360
extension headers

2765
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,560
or some dedicated amps labels this can

2766
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:41,280
avoid the

2767
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,599
impacts to the existing fields while the

2768
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:44,719
cons is

2769
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:47,280
there may be some difficulty in uh

2770
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,639
introducing a new field

2771
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,679
in the data in the data plane especially

2772
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:55,520
if you need to be processed at home hub

2773
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,400
okay next page

2774
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,679
so for the data plane optimization

2775
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:06,960
the possible approaches we can decouple

2776
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,440
the identifiers used for topology-based

2777
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,239
forwarding

2778
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:12,880
and identify used for the vtn resource

2779
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:13,599
specific

2780
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:16,800
processing for for example

2781
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,760
in the ipv6 data plane we can use the ip

2782
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:20,560
address

2783
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,880
destination address to determine the

2784
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,400
next hop and we can

2785
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,280
use another dedicated median id to

2786
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,520
identify the set of resources

2787
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:32,560
for the packet processing and in the

2788
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,560
npr's data plane

2789
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,719
we can use the top label to determine

2790
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,560
the net hub and

2791
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,719
then a dedicated label or header can be

2792
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,119
used to identify the resources used for

2793
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:46,239
packet processing the

2794
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:47,920
data plan encapsulations has been

2795
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,520
proposed in

2796
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:51,599
draft in the sixth man and npr's working

2797
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:53,760
group and there's ongoing discussion

2798
01:50:53,760 --> 01:50:57,520
about this possible encapsulations

2799
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,400
okay next page

2800
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:03,760
here are some history of about this

2801
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:04,800
draft

2802
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,679
the digital version was submitted uh

2803
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:10,239
about one years ago

2804
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,560
it gives analysis about the control plan

2805
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,719
data plane scalabilities and

2806
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:18,199
optimization suggestions and then the

2807
01:51:18,199 --> 01:51:21,280
0.01 version was uh proposed

2808
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,719
submitted last year november with many

2809
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,639
editorial changes and we add a new

2810
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:28,560
co-author

2811
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,440
the 0-2 version submitted before this

2812
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,080
itf

2813
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:33,760
we add some further analysis about the

2814
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:36,159
database options especially the controls

2815
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:37,199
and the cons of

2816
01:51:37,199 --> 01:51:40,560
each approach and we i also

2817
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,880
try to align with the definition draft

2818
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,560
that the slice definition drops about

2819
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,280
the terminologies

2820
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:50,239
okay next page

2821
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,360
uh here are some conclusions from this

2822
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,639
analysis draft

2823
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:56,719
uh firstly so we think scalability needs

2824
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:58,800
to be considered in the design of the

2825
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:00,239
control plane data plane

2826
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:03,440
of vaping plus there are

2827
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:06,239
mechanisms with different scalability

2828
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:08,080
which may be used for different

2829
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,719
scenarios and for the control plane we

2830
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:12,719
can improve the scalability by sharing

2831
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:13,440
of the

2832
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,520
instance the protocol session and the

2833
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:16,880
computation

2834
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,760
for the data plane we may improve the

2835
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,320
scalability by introducing the dedicated

2836
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,560
identifier in the data packet

2837
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,800
while the costs need to be understood

2838
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,080
there's no

2839
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:33,840
no advantage without cost yeah

2840
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:37,280
okay next slide

2841
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:40,000
for the next step we would like to

2842
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,480
solicit comments and feedbacks on this

2843
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,000
analysis and the proposals

2844
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,159
and we would like also to coordinate

2845
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:49,440
under the

2846
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,199
extension works in the data plane and

2847
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:52,560
the control plane

2848
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,599
in the relevant working groups

2849
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:59,840
okay that's all

2850
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,320
any questions for g

2851
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:10,159
i don't see anybody queuing up i guess

2852
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:12,080
we have just enough time for the last

2853
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,360
presentation

2854
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:17,920
thanks g thank you

2855
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:27,840
it'll layer up

2856
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:33,040
it low can you unmute yourself

2857
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:39,520
the wrong icon can you hear me now yes

2858
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:42,480
okay good hi i'm italo boozy from huawei

2859
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:43,679
i'm presenting this

2860
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:46,880
the draft on behalf of kotors

2861
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:50,320
uh next slide please what is the

2862
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,239
motivation the motivation for this graph

2863
01:53:52,239 --> 01:53:52,800
is that

2864
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,960
we i've we have seen a lot of

2865
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:56,719
discussions in different idea working

2866
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:57,840
groups

2867
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:00,960
uh which are very c which are discussing

2868
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,119
similar scenarios where for example we

2869
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:03,599
have

2870
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:05,280
networks which are known traffic

2871
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:07,520
engineering but for which

2872
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,880
uh we need some attributes which are a

2873
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,320
subset of those

2874
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:13,760
which are already defined by the at

2875
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:18,159
topology model in rfc878795

2876
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:21,280
and there is uh some

2877
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:23,199
there was some proposals to create a new

2878
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:24,480
modus rather than

2879
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:26,560
using the t topology model and the

2880
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,639
reason is usually the fact that

2881
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:30,960
the t topology model in the rsc is looks

2882
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,639
very complex at the first glance because

2883
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:33,360
it's very

2884
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,080
huge and the reason why it is very huge

2885
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,040
is because

2886
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,760
it is supporting a lot of features and

2887
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,840
some of which features are intended to

2888
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,400
be used

2889
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,480
only with traffic engineering networks

2890
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,320
but either of these features

2891
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,080
are actually equally applicable to

2892
01:54:48,080 --> 01:54:49,520
traffic engineering and

2893
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,960
no traffic engineering networks and all

2894
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,119
these features and attributes in the

2895
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:56,400
topology model are

2896
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,599
actually optional so what what is

2897
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:02,639
what appeared what very clear uh to

2898
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:05,599
to to many people outside of the set of

2899
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:06,239
people

2900
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:09,280
the authors is that a subset something

2901
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:10,320
like a profile

2902
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,199
of this model can be actually used in

2903
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,400
specific

2904
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:17,599
network scenarios including use cases

2905
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:18,400
which are

2906
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:21,280
not traffic engineering and the draft is

2907
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,280
intended to clarify this

2908
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:26,960
next slide please and

2909
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,080
the and the draft is examines

2910
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:32,719
describes five examples these are

2911
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:34,159
examples they are not

2912
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:37,360
all uh new scenarios may be also useful

2913
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,760
uh maybe also applicable but okay we

2914
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:41,520
focus only on the five

2915
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:43,679
on this files just to show that there

2916
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:45,280
are some cases

2917
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,040
which are known traffic engineering or

2918
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:50,080
not may not be traffic engineering where

2919
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:51,920
there are useful attributes in the t

2920
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:53,599
topology model that can be used

2921
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:56,239
to address these use cases and next

2922
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:56,960
slide please

2923
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,960
okay and as you can go quite quickly

2924
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:00,159
it's just to show

2925
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:02,320
that the profile can be very small you

2926
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:03,280
can see that

2927
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,440
instead of tens of pages like the

2928
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,560
topology

2929
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,440
three you can stay in one slide because

2930
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:10,560
you just need one

2931
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,360
or few attributes next slide please

2932
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,679
i'll try to go okay next yeah also next

2933
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:18,560
yeah these are just

2934
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,119
examples for people to read then there

2935
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:24,320
was some discussion about how to augment

2936
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:27,119
the topology model and there are three

2937
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:28,719
options one option is that we can

2938
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:29,360
augment

2939
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:31,760
that the the topology model or a profile

2940
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:32,400
of it

2941
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:35,440
uh depending on your needs it depends

2942
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:36,719
this is applicable where you need to

2943
01:56:36,719 --> 01:56:39,280
provide technology specific attributes

2944
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,520
uh to both entities which are defining

2945
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,679
network topology as well as entities

2946
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:45,440
which are defined in the topology like

2947
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:47,360
bandwidth or ttps or connectivity

2948
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,719
metrics

2949
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:51,840
next slide if instead

2950
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:55,599
option two you what you need is only to

2951
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:57,360
provide technology specific attributes

2952
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,440
for node links atps you can recommend

2953
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,800
the network topology

2954
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,119
and you can still use the generic

2955
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:05,520
attributes from the t topology profile

2956
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,719
by uh adopting what is called

2957
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,080
multiple inheritance so you can

2958
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,480
instantiate both a topology model

2959
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,560
or a profile of it and the network

2960
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:15,920
technology and the technology-specific

2961
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:16,239
net

2962
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,400
topology model in your network and that

2963
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:19,920
works very fine

2964
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,360
and we have also option three in the

2965
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:22,960
next slide

2966
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:26,480
is where you can split into two models

2967
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:28,080
one which augments the network topology

2968
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:29,920
once you recommend the t topology or the

2969
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,040
profile of it

2970
01:57:31,040 --> 01:57:32,960
and there is no big advantage but it

2971
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,320
could be a useful option

2972
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,320
in case where for example the network

2973
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,239
topology augmentation already exists and

2974
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:39,920
you want to create a new

2975
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,599
you add the new attributes for the t

2976
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,920
topology so we discuss these three

2977
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:44,639
options

2978
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:48,239
next slide and we give some example

2979
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:50,239
for a link for example about where you

2980
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:52,960
can put technology specific commentation

2981
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:54,639
for the bandwidth for example you must

2982
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,080
follow option one or three

2983
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:57,679
if you want to put something under the

2984
01:57:57,679 --> 01:57:59,199
link attributes you must follow other

2985
01:57:59,199 --> 01:58:00,639
option one or three but if you want to

2986
01:58:00,639 --> 01:58:02,159
put something under the link

2987
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,360
you can do in whichever option you wish

2988
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:09,360
all you need next slide okay a couple of

2989
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,280
comments i got offline which are of an

2990
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:11,920
issue

2991
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,679
the first issue is that one since the

2992
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:15,119
server implements a profile

2993
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:17,679
how the client is can know which profile

2994
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:19,040
is implemented

2995
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,040
uh i seems that they're not an issue

2996
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:22,639
when you read the operation at a store

2997
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:23,199
because

2998
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:25,199
by reading you know that the server

2999
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:27,520
reports only the leave the the

3000
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:29,199
leaves that the the young leaves which

3001
01:58:29,199 --> 01:58:30,800
has been implemented

3002
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:32,719
maybe an issue when you write so you

3003
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:34,080
don't know which

3004
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:35,840
attribute can be written or not cannot

3005
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,000
be read cannot be written because not

3006
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,760
implemented on the server

3007
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:42,880
uh this seems a more generical issue and

3008
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,320
the question is better whether we need

3009
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,239
to discuss it in this draft or somewhere

3010
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:47,040
else

3011
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,320
and i don't know the answer at this

3012
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,159
moment time and i was planning to

3013
01:58:50,159 --> 01:58:51,840
to send the question to the networking

3014
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,520
group but actually i'm i'm a little bit

3015
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:54,719
late

3016
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:57,040
okay so a an investigation with that

3017
01:58:57,040 --> 01:58:58,639
moment he is going to start to

3018
01:58:58,639 --> 01:58:59,599
understand

3019
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:02,400
how to deal or how the client can know

3020
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,159
whether an optional attribute

3021
01:59:04,159 --> 01:59:06,239
can be configured or not by the server

3022
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:07,599
implementation

3023
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:09,280
and there was also a comment about the

3024
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,199
option two and three where we use the

3025
01:59:11,199 --> 01:59:12,960
multiple inheritance this multiple

3026
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,719
inheritance is discussed in

3027
01:59:14,719 --> 01:59:16,719
many roughs but not discussed not

3028
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:18,000
detailed

3029
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,239
anywhere and there some was a question

3030
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,800
why not using this draft to discuss to

3031
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,480
describe in details how the multiple

3032
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,320
inheritance can be used

3033
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:29,520
this is a feature of the rfc8345 and not

3034
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:30,239
of this

3035
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:34,080
of the 8795 but i'm open to discussion

3036
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,480
about whether to do it in this draft or

3037
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:39,040
somewhere else

3038
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,599
in next slide maybe we can take the

3039
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,199
discussion

3040
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:46,400
compacted okay the next steps okay we

3041
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,080
want to advertise this draft

3042
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,760
we have already advertised oc campaign

3043
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,520
upsell a working group

3044
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,840
but if you if you see any other working

3045
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,760
groups which maybe benefit from

3046
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:58,880
this information i'm with i think we

3047
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,719
should send this note

3048
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,760
we solicit more review and feedback sir

3049
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:05,920
and we i thanks daniela for the first

3050
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:07,199
feedback sir and

3051
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:09,360
we can address additional these open

3052
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:11,119
issues and any other comments which are

3053
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:12,400
received

3054
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:14,159
and the other question is whether there

3055
02:00:14,159 --> 02:00:16,159
is an interest to further work progress

3056
02:00:16,159 --> 02:00:16,960
this work

3057
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,000
and i there are some some

3058
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,679
options one option is to progress this

3059
02:00:21,679 --> 02:00:25,040
document as an information rsc

3060
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,960
but i know there is some reluctance from

3061
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,679
the isg on too many informations

3062
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:31,679
we may merge the content with a tutorial

3063
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:33,760
or we can do something rewiki or

3064
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:36,159
any other options just what whatever the

3065
02:00:36,159 --> 02:00:37,520
working group thinks is more

3066
