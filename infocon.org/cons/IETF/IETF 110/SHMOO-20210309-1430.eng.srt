read the relevant rfcs they have more

36
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,000
details than what's in here

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,159
and like it requires like more time than

38
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,238
i can show the slide for

39
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,238
and uh just going through yeah and

40
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
thanks uh

41
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,519
uh charles like for taking the minutes

42
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,759
i'll be watching the jabra as well

43
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,120
and we'll just go through the

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
deliverables very quickly

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
and go on to the presentations for the

46
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,280
working group drafts and the

47
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,240
uh the hackathon draft which is not at

48
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,040
the working group item

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,199
so we have like four classes of

50
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,960
deliverables and

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
the idea is like you know kind of we are

52
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,479
trying to start adopting drafts as soon

53
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,000
as possible when there was a candidate

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,960
for it

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,400
and the first two uh guidelines so first

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
of them for

57
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,479
you know the cancellation considerations

58
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,639
uh we do have a working group item this

59
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,160
is like uh

60
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,320
martin's draft uh it was our press

61
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,759
working group item between the last two

62
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,400
meetings

63
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
from the last meeting to now and um

64
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,520
there's like some comments that came in

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,960
like not like extremely

66
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
actionable so there is concerns but uh

67
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
some of them were not very

68
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,720
i would say um it's not clear like what

69
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,360
changes need to be made to the draft so

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,199
but jay's comments also came in a couple

71
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,080
of days ago

72
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,960
so martin has kind of put together some

73
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,680
kind of

74
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,080
responses for that and we can have a

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,440
discussion today

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,400
as to uh how to proceed uh incorporating

77
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,680
those comments

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,560
and uh there's also a draft for the

79
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,000
meeting fees for fully online

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,919
meetings so this is the the remote feed

81
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,840
draft so like john is going to present

82
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
today along with media and

83
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
rich along with him uh and

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
this this one has like you know kind of

85
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
a lot of the comments already

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,960
uh integrated into the draft and uh

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
so i think like this should be ready for

88
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,639
uh working group last call pretty

89
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,400
quickly

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,960
and as the meeting planning itself uh

91
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,840
this has been

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,600
kind of like uh lagging a little bit

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
behind so last time we had like two

94
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,240
drafts

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
uh one of them is like mallory's draft

96
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,919
another one is michael's draft

97
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
um they uh both were presented last time

98
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
and they haven't received any updates in

99
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,199
there

100
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,960
but like uh charles has updated this

101
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,039
draft for the hackathon

102
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,080
for a fully virtual itf and uh charles

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
present today and the technology front

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,319
uh really there's not much in there

105
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,400
um i was expecting like you know quite a

106
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
few drafts will show up here

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,919
but this has been surprisingly uh very

108
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,039
little activity there

109
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
so other than the show of hands draft we

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
haven't seen much

111
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,319
uh progress in this so the idea is like

112
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,680
to continue working on

113
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
the two drafts where we have the

114
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,919
candidates and try to adopt the

115
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,599
hackathon draft soon

116
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,319
and continue to re-evaluate like you

117
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,400
know what are the things that we need

118
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,720
as a community going forward so any

119
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,840
questions on it

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,479
okay i don't see anybody at the mic

121
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
okay so uh going on like so uh we have

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
uh three presentations today

123
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,639
oh somebody in the mic yeah please go

124
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
ahead yeah hi sriracha i don't i'm yeah

125
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,160
i was in the key i'm not sure what

126
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,599
happened there but yeah just a question

127
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,520
about the show of hands tool so

128
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,880
um at one point we discussed

129
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,400
the idea of adopting that came up and

130
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,319
i don't remember the exact context we

131
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,319
decided not to adopt it but i wasn't

132
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,680
aware there was a deliverable in this

133
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,720
area so

134
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
is my recollection of this incorrect

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
um yeah there is like a technology

136
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
deliverable in the system right so

137
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,479
uh there could be multiple drafts that

138
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:51,919
combine together to

139
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
satisfy the deliverable but but we are

140
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,000
still like kind of like deciding what

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,599
are the set of tools right and and the

142
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:58,000
feedback

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,199
for this was let's say like a lot of

144
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,400
people are positive but there's also

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,759
like a lot of people who are negative

146
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,520
and some people like ambivalent on this

147
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,360
so the idea is to figure out like you

148
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,199
know kind of what are the set of tools

149
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
that we need so once we get the first

150
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,759
two drafts on the way

151
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,840
we can continue to discuss this and and

152
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,520
do the technology pieces right like and

153
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,879
that's kind of the

154
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,960
high level thinking i have and we can

155
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,319
certainly discuss that further right

156
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,879
like you know

157
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
uh but uh yeah like i i do think it's

158
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,319
useful like you know i'm not sure like

159
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
you know how the results have to be

160
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,440
presented right like you know the

161
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,680
um the piano kind of stuff is like kind

162
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
of like you know weird for a little

163
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
few people right but that's something we

164
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,399
can figure out like you know how we use

165
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,599
uh some tool like this to kind of judge

166
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,080
the

167
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,159
um you know the voice out the audience

168
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,279
kind of thing so

169
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,000
uh yeah that's kind of my image the

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600

178
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,000
yep uh can you all hear me yeah thank

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,240
you

180
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,240
um so um uh john reed akamai

181
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
uh here again to talk about this draft

182
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,680
uh

183
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,320
with miria and rich rich's co-chairing

184
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
acme so he's not here right now

185
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
um basically where we are is uh

186
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,600
you know we think we're quite close if

187
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
not ready for working group last call

188
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,800
i think some other people mention that

189
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
on the list uh

190
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,360
and there's uh sort of two pull requests

191
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,839
that

192
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,480
uh concern the same issue uh that you

193
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,920
know i feel like once we resolve those

194
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,519
we're probably in a good position

195
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,720
and that issue is around uh

196
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
other events uh beyond you know meetings

197
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,880
and working group sessions

198
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
and uh there were sort of two proposals

199
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,920
one was

200
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,880
uh simply to add a parenthetical that uh

201
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
meetings include other related events

202
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
the other was to be a bit more detailed

203
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
about

204
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,560
uh explicitly calling out the other

205
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
events and some examples of them such as

206
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
you know the hackathon for which

207
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000
obviously a fee is not charged right now

208
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
but if one were to be charged in the

209
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,240
future to indicate that this uh

210
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
draft should apply to that as well uh so

211
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
we really just wanted to get the

212
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,959
working group's opinion as to whether we

213
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,839
are

214
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,959
uh close to last call and if folks have

215
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,320
any opinions on

216
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,360
either of the two methods to add some

217
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,680
clarity around related events

218
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,519
so really short three slides i

219
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,640
definitely won't need the whole 15

220
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,000
minutes unless there's a very

221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,839
complicated questions

222
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,680
so if you have any questions on this can

223
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,839
you please come up to the mic

224
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
did you want to add anything uh yeah i i

225
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,680
just want to say that

226
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,600
like you can also just go and get up and

227
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
have a look what the proposals are

228
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
um but it's really this like general

229
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,720
question if you want to restrict the

230
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,360
draft on meeting fees to the to the main

231
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,839
meeting

232
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
venue only or if you want to be a little

233
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
bit broader here and like if we want to

234
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
be a little bit broader

235
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
what's the broader so i hope we like if

236
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
we want to be broader i hope we can

237
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
convert soon and move forward quickly or

238
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,440
maybe if we can't converge soon then we

239
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,839
might just be very focused and move on

240
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,959
make sense media to just like be focused

241
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,240
and move on right so

242
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,360
um bob go ahead

243
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,519
yes i mean i'd be careful with the

244
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,040
wording about

245
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,200
free because i mean right now we're very

246
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,040
fortunate that we have very good

247
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,720
support from isak and so forth um but if

248
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,399
money should ever get tight then we

249
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,200
you know maintaining free might not be

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
possible

251
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,320
so certainly i think it's it's a

252
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
reasonable goal

253
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,639
but i'm not sure i want to make it

254
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,839
completely authoritative

255
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,720
can i reply to that

256
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,160
yeah go ahead yeah i think that's like

257
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
an entirely different point so this

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,760
draft on purpose just sets up a

259
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,880
principle about

260
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,120
having free options and does not talk

261
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,959
about financing because that's a

262
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,360
question from the lac

263
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
um if you know if there's actually a

264
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,040
problem in the future they need to come

265
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,399
back to the community we have to talk

266
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,399
about it but like this would actually

267
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
change the base principle of the draft

268
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,279
entirely

269
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
okay but it does seem to be ignoring the

270
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
underlying reality that it's not free

271
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
that everything we do has costs

272
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,959
yes but it's a different question how

273
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,480
these costs are financed if you have to

274
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,000
have a meeting for free for it

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
or the other ways to finance it right

276
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,560
that's not a question for this draft

277
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,800
that's the question for the llc

278
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,720
yeah uh thanks bob i i think that's a

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,920
really good point right

280
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,959
and uh when the group was chartered that

281
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,600
was like

282
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,200
ruled out of scope right the financial

283
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,519
model itself and that's probably

284
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,279
something we can explore afterwards

285
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,040
right once we get this out

286
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,839
and maybe at some future point if like

287
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,279
we do think it's not going to work like

288
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,480
we had to figure out like what is the

289
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
venue but right now we are not chatted

290
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,639
to

291
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,839
uh look at the financial model itself

292
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,959
bob

293
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279
well i wasn't suggesting we look at the

294
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
financial model i'm just

295
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
just pick words that make this a goal

296
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,720
not not a strict requirement

297
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,839
um can you um

298
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,920
uh probably suggest some text bob like

299
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,360
you know where you want some changes in

300
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,079
this uh

301
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
if that would be good uh and then we can

302
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
have the discussion right like there's

303
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,480
like

304
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
this is generally just laying down a

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
principle right like that we want to

306
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,160
follow

307
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,639
and um if you think this like too

308
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,399
prescriptive we can have the discussion

309
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,519
on where like the

310
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,240
the things uh can be changed there right

311
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,320
all right

312
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
and the draft does call call out that

313
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,519
you know we we

314
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,680
that you know obviously there there is

315
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,600
not a zero cost associated with that

316
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,160
there's a whole section on that so

317
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
yeah um i see charles was in the yeah

318
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
charles and larson

319
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,839
yeah thanks

320
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,880
yeah hi um so i just wanted to comment

321
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,279
on the

322
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
the two proposals for the or the

323
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,120
proposals for the related events

324
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
and um uh so you know obviously

325
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,240
this is one of the things i brought up i

326
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
think it's important to cover the

327
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,880
related events

328
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,839
um i thought the uh the just kind of

329
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,440
relatively simple

330
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,160
uh proposal where we just added in um

331
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,079
that this applied not only to the ietf

332
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,240
meeting but also two related events

333
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,800
that that was uh at least that kind of

334
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
simple approach was acceptable

335
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,240
to me it seemed like it could work it's

336
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,320
a it's kind of a tough balance between

337
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,199
putting a lot

338
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,480
where you think it's really really uh

339
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,399
very descriptive and there's no

340
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,760
ambiguity in it and then

341
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,160
leaving a little bit of ambiguity so

342
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,839
that the draft is more

343
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,680
kind of future proof and putting the

344
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,040
related events

345
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,199
to me was an okay way to do it i think

346
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,120
alternatively we could spell out some of

347
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
the events that we know about but

348
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
but then as soon as there's something

349
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,600
new that we all agree would be a related

350
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,440
event but it's not explicitly mentioned

351
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
then i could see where we might have

352
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,399
some problems so

353
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,759
um but also it sounded as if i hadn't

354
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,000
seen

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,959
any more ongoing discussion after uh

356
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
what was in the mailing list is is the

357
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,680
discussion

358
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,199
continuing in github or because i could

359
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
take a look there i hadn't seen that if

360
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
there was something happening

361
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
i don't think there's much discussion

362
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,480
the reason so i i'd be okay with the

363
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,680
small change i'm just like

364
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,560
mentioning it because like putting uh

365
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,000
related events in the scope was

366
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
something we really didn't consider at

367
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
the beginning so it does change the

368
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
scope of the draft quite a bit

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,600
even if it's just like two words uh so i

370
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,199
want to make sure that like the

371
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,199
the working group is okay with this

372
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,199
actually quite big change

373
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
um and then you know

374
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,199
i got i got start thinking about this

375
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,040
when i thought about social events right

376
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,600
um

377
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,199
we don't have remote options for social

378
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,800
events but like do we need to offer in

379
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,279
future

380
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,199
remote option for social revenge and has

381
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,959
this to be have a free option as well

382
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,839
right

383
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,199
um and um my answer to that would be

384
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,000
rather than no

385
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,839
while if you talk about the hackathon i

386
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,759
really really think this this should be

387
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,639
free and we

388
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,240
should make it possible for as many

389
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
people as possible to participate

390
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,319
also to increase um you know diversity

391
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,160
and outreach and whatever

392
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,359
um but like at that point it wasn't a

393
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
super easy decision for me anymore

394
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,359
anymore and like i'm okay to to take the

395
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,359
two words in to to leave it awake and to

396
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,799
have a discussion at another point of

397
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,160
time when it comes up

398
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,679
but it would also be okay to just like

399
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,439
focus on meeting fees and go ahead with

400
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
it

401
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,880
yeah i mean actually you reminded me of

402
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,799
uh one of the things was uh

403
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,440
pointing to the other rfc i forget which

404
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,360
one it is that defined

405
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
um some concept of intf work or

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
something like that

407
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,520
and and i think that helped because at

408
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
least for me that

409
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,200
differentiated between those things that

410
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,320
really have to do with

411
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
the work of the uh the ihf meeting as

412
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,640
opposed to

413
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
you know auxiliary events that are more

414
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
for for fun

415
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,280
like the social um

416
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,600
so you know with those two things in

417
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,320
there i

418
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,679
that worked for me but uh

419
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,080
that you know anyways just giving my two

420
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,039
cents

421
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,400
uh can you can you point this rc out

422
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,679
again and then maybe we can just add

423
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,600
like a half sentence move it down

424
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,640
rather than a whole paragraph okay

425
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
yeah i'll have to look it up i don't

426
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,480
remember it but it came up in the email

427
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,400
thread but i'll circle back on that and

428
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,039
post something to the list

429
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,400
thanks thanks charles thank you um

430
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
lars please go ahead hey so i i

431
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
i'm sympathize with bob's point a little

432
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,919
bit in the sense that this draft at the

433
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
moment leaves it sort of completely open

434
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,360
uh and says it doesn't talk about

435
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
financials i wonder if sort of a middle

436
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,000
ground proposal would be

437
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
to add uh something to the draft that

438
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,600
says that

439
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,400
you know the there might be a limit to

440
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,480
the number of free passes that are given

441
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,360
out

442
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
if if financials become a constraint or

443
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,720
something like that

444
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
so you at least sort of allow that as a

445
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
possibility given that this would be a

446
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,360
bcp

447
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,640
because at the moment you can read this

448
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,559
and basically say unlimited free passes

449
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,200
forever

450
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
right which is i'm not sure if that's

451
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,120
the extreme we want to

452
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,520
you know establish certainly we want to

453
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
do it when we have money for it

454
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,320
but if we at some point don't

455
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
it would be nice to have a little caveat

456
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
in there that allows cllc board to

457
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
do things differently so

458
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,840
a couple of points so first of all we

459
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
did we didn't put a limit on there

460
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,480
because

461
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,640
that was when this meeting remote

462
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
feeding if he came up on the ietf list

463
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
was like one of the big concerns that

464
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,120
it was limited to 100 people only and

465
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
nobody understood where this come from

466
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,760
and that shouldn't be the limit it

467
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,200
shouldn't it should not it should not

468
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,080
depend on

469
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,600
how much money we have to do it it

470
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
should really depend on if somebody

471
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,039
needs to

472
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,720
to have the freeway but in order to

473
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,080
participate or not right

474
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
people who have been participating

475
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,440
remotely

476
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
without a fee should be able to do that

477
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,880
they should be able to just continue

478
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,919
their work

479
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
and binding uh the

480
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,840
viability of the atf to meeting fees you

481
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,880
know it's a completely different

482
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,840
discussion

483
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,760
because when you say we cannot provide

484
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,600
free waivers anymore because we don't

485
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,559
have enough money

486
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,559
maybe you didn't do enough sponsoring

487
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,000
you didn't carefully about the money

488
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,880
because like

489
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
meeting fees is not the only way of

490
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,799
income rate so this is like going into a

491
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,400
lot of corner cases and that's what we

492
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,679
don't want to discuss in the draft

493
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,200
and i had a subpoena but i don't know

494
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,880
but i don't want to discuss by not

495
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,240
discussing it you're not making the

496
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,039
problem go away

497
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,440
so yes but it's not it's not our problem

498
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,760
it's the llc's problem

499
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
it's a simplistic way of thinking of it

500
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
media right but yeah

501
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
this is just giving guiding principles

502
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,760
to the llc what they do with it is a

503
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,559
different question

504
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
and that's my third one so we do discuss

505
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,640
a little bit about misuse in the draft

506
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,240
because there should always be enough

507
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
money for people who actually need the

508
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,720
fee

509
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,799
the waiver um to have that shouldn't be

510
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,559
a concern because it shouldn't be like a

511
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,080
huge amount of money the larger amount

512
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,600
of participants should actually pay

513
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
because that's how the atf works there

514
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,559
are companies who have money who want to

515
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,320
participate who get something out of it

516
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,919
right if that principle doesn't work

517
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,440
anymore we have a different problem

518
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,960
so the only thing we need to make sure

519
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
is that this is not misused but that's

520
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,240
also something that we say

521
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,679
we should care about it if it actually

522
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
happens so your principal says must

523
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,320
there must always be an option for free

524
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
remote participation if your principal

525
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,799
said should i

526
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,960
be completely fine so there must always

527
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,520
be an option for free participation but

528
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,000
you know

529
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,280
how you decide who gets the free

530
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,559
participation might be a different

531
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,760
question

532
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,520
how you decide if something is misused

533
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
or aren't actually valid use is a

534
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,918
different question

535
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,880
yeah and you know like we said we do

536
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
have those two sections in there so

537
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
you know i i've heard some folks say

538
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,679
that we should talk about it

539
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,520
you know we do talk about it so uh

540
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
having some more concrete suggestions of

541
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,159
of

542
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:49,760
you know ways to address this that is

543
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,039
not already addressed by the text would

544
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:51,760
be

545
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,799
helpful if folks have feedback on that i

546
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,440
i think i'll i'll send some text

547
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,679
john and maria right like i do have some

548
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,600
thoughts on this so i will send some

549
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,720
sample text i i i understand where bob

550
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,039
and

551
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,960
lars are coming from i'll see if i can

552
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,280
come up with some text which kind of

553
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,400
doesn't say hey llc figured it out uh

554
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
to going saying hey like we don't we do

555
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
fixed numbers so i i don't like the

556
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,360
fixed number thing either so i think

557
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,120
i'll think of some text

558
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
yeah that's also my point like i

559
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,000
understand where the concerns are coming

560
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
from i'm just like don't think like

561
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
restricting the number of freewares is

562
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,320
the right thing to do here

563
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,600
okay thank you uh martin you are up next

564
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,960
yeah i just want to say that i think

565
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,360
conceptually the idea that there's like

566
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,799
a fixed number of

567
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,320
free waivers that we can afford it's

568
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,840
just it's just not correct like the

569
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,880
marginal cost

570
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,080
of of a remote attendees

571
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,559
is essentially zero so like free waivers

572
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,159
are only a problem to the extent that

573
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:50,960
they

574
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
co that we they cannibalize people who

575
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,240
would otherwise pay

576
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,200
and um you know i mean i i'm not sure

577
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,480
how you feel about some of the language

578
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
about like

579
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,280
criteria for that i mean we've gotten

580
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
away with now with just like sort of

581
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,080
just saying

582
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,960
an honor system um that may become

583
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,480
untenable at some point but

584
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
we're certainly not there today and i

585
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,080
wouldn't mind language that made it

586
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,039
clear that we could

587
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,679
tighten those restrictions if if they're

588
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,200
proved to be a problem

589
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,679
um but but having a free option i know i

590
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,880
don't think there's any limit on how

591
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
many

592
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,880
on how many waivers you can grant yeah

593
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,400
that's a good point i think like as long

594
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,000
as you have enough people paying like

595
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,720
adding

596
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,480
a huge number of free waivers on top of

597
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,919
that is not a financial problem

598
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,799
thank you um i don't see anybody else in

599
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,520
the queue uh

600
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,600
unless like charles lars or martin you

601
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,559
want to make another comment

602
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,240
okay thank you so uh media like and john

603
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,279
i'll send you the

604
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,120
like text i promise like within a week

605
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
or so and and let's try to

606
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,039
get the draft to work to last call and

607
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,679
see how things go from there

608
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:04,080
thank you thanks thanks

609
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,000
uh martin you're up next i'll start

610
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,320
sharing

611
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,559
ah yes all right so um we had another

612
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,840
successful adoption call

613
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,320
uh a while back and um thanks for

614
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
everyone's comments um

615
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,840
this is my very short summary of the

616
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,039
email feedback

617
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
i would say that uh at the time these

618
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,400
messages were sent i would agree with

619
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
all of these sentiments um

620
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,640
but as suresh hinted i don't think

621
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,799
there's any any actionable

622
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,799
stuff here um i invite people to

623
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,080
continue to read the document

624
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,919
and and comment next slide but i did ask

625
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,559
jay to next slide please i did ask jay

626
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:46,960
as

627
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,559
um you know the llc's as soon as the

628
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,080
implementer of this draft and actually i

629
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
think this applies to some lego drafts

630
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,279
too like some feedback for the llc would

631
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,240
be good because they will be

632
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,440
implementing this

633
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,559
i did ask him to do a thorough review of

634
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,120
it and

635
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
he provided one couple days ago so i've

636
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
not had a ton of time to digest this but

637
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,159
i would summarize the this is the main

638
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,679
points um

639
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,760
he introduced this concept emergency

640
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,039
versus non-emergency

641
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,960
um in which like there's time for

642
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
consultation versus

643
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
the llc just has to kind of execute and

644
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,240
i think it's a useful concept and i'm

645
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,440
planning to put in the next version of

646
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,760
the draft another thing he called out

647
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,640
that i think needs

648
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,279
more discussion uh regards the roles of

649
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,360
the llc and the iesg

650
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,880
in the current version of the draft the

651
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,120
llc is

652
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,200
purely addressing the ability of the

653
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,480
venue to support

654
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,559
the meeting and um and that it is safe

655
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,679
to um to have people attend um and the

656
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,400
isg

657
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,720
is fully responsible for saying with

658
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,080
this number of people and this

659
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,720
this constellation of bands and so on

660
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
we're able to carry on the work

661
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,919
of of meeting effectively in person

662
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,159
um and this is i think kind of how it

663
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,360
worked in 107

664
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,039
um which is where we really deal with

665
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,679
this we uh the isg went out to the

666
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
working groups and kind of pulled them

667
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,200
and said like you know do you have

668
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
enough people and obviously this the

669
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,400
situation changed very quickly and we

670
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
had to cancel regardless of the answer

671
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
but for a while we're looking at do we

672
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
have enough people we asked the working

673
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,360
chairs if it was viable for them to

674
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,640
continue with the current

675
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,799
situation regarding corporate travel

676
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,000
bans and so on

677
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
and that and like the advantage of that

678
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,240
that approach is that um

679
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
you know it gets the llc out of the

680
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,679
business of saying well you know this

681
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,799
nation

682
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,000
uh has a travel ban to the host nation

683
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,679
but like it's not that important to the

684
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,679
standards process we continue and

685
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
like this company is is you know this

686
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,240
company is important has a travel ban or

687
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,360
a boycott or whatever

688
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,120
um and just kind of gets out of those

689
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
sorts of fine-grained decisions

690
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
jay pointed out that rfc oh gosh i lost

691
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,200
the number now i think it's like 87

692
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
13 or something has a

693
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,440
has a meeting criterion um

694
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,640
in its normal venue vetting process that

695
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,400
the vast majority of attendees can

696
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,279
attend

697
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,960
so um i think the number we've been

698
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,520
using for vast majority is 80

699
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:20,080
and so i would um

700
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,080
not so uh let's see

701
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,600
okay i'm gonna assume that you can hear

702
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,200
me again um

703
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,360
the uh so like i think it is probably

704
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,200
fine to have something like an 80

705
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
threshold for the llc to evaluate based

706
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,399
on historic

707
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,640
attendance and um and still give the isu

708
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
the role to do more fine grain control

709
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,760
like i mean for instance in san

710
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,720
francisco

711
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,399
i think it's entirely possible coming up

712
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,760
here at 111 that

713
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,840
uh us domestic travel will be completely

714
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,520
fine but international travel will be

715
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
pretty broken and

716
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,320
that implies that we would have

717
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,360
something like 50 of the of the of the

718
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,320
of the population that could attend and

719
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,720
um

720
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,600
that would meet the the llc's criteria

721
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
but the isg would still be well known so

722
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
i'd say no that's not satisfactory and

723
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,320
and stop it there um jay also had some

724
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,399
other rewardings that that i would um

725
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
that i'm just gonna implement i think

726
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,039
they're uncontroversial uh i can take

727
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,799
i can take charles out of the queue now

728
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,480
to talk about this

729
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,600
before i go to the next slide

730
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,480
chance go ahead

731
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,200
sorry i think i never exited the key i

732
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,799
just did now so

733
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,039
i was there actually all right no

734
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,840
worries

735
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,120
moving along

736
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,000
um okay then jordy uh i guess spurred by

737
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,880
by jay's

738
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,600
um review had some additional comments

739
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,440
so another issue that uh you know

740
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
i kind of anticipated would be a little

741
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,039
controversial

742
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,279
was that the safety was obsessed it was

743
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,240
assessed via

744
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,360
travel advisories and um for various

745
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,080
reasons

746
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,039
the us department of state it uh is a

747
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,520
fairly

748
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,840
long-standing well-respected uh source

749
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,360
of travel advisories

750
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,760
um it's in english which is useful since

751
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,520
the llc staff is guaranteed to speak

752
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,480
english

753
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,840
uh however they the us dos

754
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,880
does not um provide advisors travel to

755
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
the united states and so i needed

756
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,799
another

757
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,520
another source i i thought the eu might

758
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,559
be a good source but

759
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,200
um they don't do that at the eu level

760
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,159
and so

761
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,880
uh the uk foreign office happens to be

762
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,240
english speaking and

763
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,120
not in the u.s so i picked that one i'm

764
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
completely happy to

765
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,559
suggest an albert source there um

766
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,360
uh jordy isn't really happy with that

767
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,880
and would like some other formulation i

768
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,640
think the one he proposed is not really

769
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,600
viable but i'm i'm open to some other

770
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,399
one

771
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,120
there uh and then his other comment was

772
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,640
on reimbursement

773
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,760
um so the current reimbursement text is

774
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,240
that

775
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,399
the itf there's some there's some

776
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,919
caveats in there and some

777
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,159
some exceptions but basically that if

778
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,679
the idf cancels the meaning it should

779
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,799
refund your

780
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,440
meeting fees but not your travel costs

781
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,640
um

782
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,399
and there's an escape clause like let's

783
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,000
not become insolvent because of this

784
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
let's not go bankrupt an effort to

785
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
refund people

786
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,960
he wanted he wanted the itf to refund

787
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,159
travel fees uh

788
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,640
that seemed like seems problematic to me

789
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,760
because

790
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,360
itf doesn't have that money in the first

791
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
place like the airlines and hotels do

792
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,799
but um i mean i guess i can see

793
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,039
the reasoning behind his argument so i

794
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,240
i'm happy to take

795
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,679
that's the end of my presentation i'm

796
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:40,960
happy to take thoughts and comments

797
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,799
about any of these items

798
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,120
thanks

799
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
thank you thanks martin uh media go

800
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,840
ahead

801
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
yeah i agree with miriam right um

802
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
there's travel insurances that can be

803
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,000
obtained if

804
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
one wants to use them or if your

805
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,600
employer pays for and they have that

806
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:33,840
and the idea can simply not do this

807
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,799
thanks lars

808
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,679
uh jody go ahead yup my point about

809
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,360
refunding is that

810
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,559
if there is uh a decision a grown

811
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,159
decision

812
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,440
of cancelling a meeting

813
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,320
that should have some liability on the

814
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,440
idf

815
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,840
i mean if there is a global emergency or

816
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
a local emergency or whatever

817
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,799
i think that's fine but what happens if

818
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,480
the atf the llc

819
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,919
take a wrong decision that that was my

820
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,840
point maybe i didn't make it

821
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,880
clear so i am not talking in general but

822
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,159
uh

823
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,000
we need to to put a limit borderline

824
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,799
about

825
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,919
what can be a good decision to cancel a

826
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,279
meeting and what not

827
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,679
especially because if we cancel a

828
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,880
meeting

829
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,039
because for example half of the

830
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,440
participants decide not to attend

831
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,000
and nothing is happening i mean nothing

832
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,799
that that

833
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,440
avoids the meeting coming on of course

834
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,080
the itf is saving some money so

835
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,360
some of this money being saved can be uh

836
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,399
used to to to to pay back

837
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,320
the participants that they don't they

838
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,080
are not able to get the refunding from

839
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,559
the

840
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,120
from the airline okay that was my point

841
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
about the funding

842
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,880
uh the the other point about uh

843
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,039
the u.s advisory and the uk advisory is

844
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:03,840
first

845
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,519
they are wrong i recall uh

846
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,399
that was about four years ago the uk

847
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,720
advisory was still saying that

848
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,960
spain is a terrorist country and we

849
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,640
cannot have meetings there and is

850
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,480
suggested not to travel there

851
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,200
it's ridiculous that's the first thing

852
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,440
so that shows that they are clearly

853
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,240
political

854
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,039
bias the second thing is that it's

855
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:27,840
unethical

856
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,200
and it's uh discriminatory for any

857
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,480
itf document to cite any specific

858
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,679
country

859
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,880
i suggested awarding uh that i think in

860
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,080
my work

861
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,679
why we don't need to to to to mention

862
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,399
specific countries uh if if the

863
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,679
insurance companies

864
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,399
are already mentioning the advisories

865
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,159
from us

866
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,760
then you don't need to put that in a

867
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,360
rarefield because it's already in the

868
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,720
contracts from the insurance

869
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,519
right so making the the document

870
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,559
transparent

871
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,000
uh clear and

872
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,960
very neutral that means that the llc

873
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
still need to take in consideration the

874
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,239
insurance policies

875
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,440
i think that that's normal

876
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,000
thank you okay jordy i i i think i think

877
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,719
there's a lot of

878
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,560
um let me take the opportunity to

879
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,000
respond to a few of those

880
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,320
items so uh number one on the its saving

881
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,679
money when it was cancellation i don't

882
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
know that's necessarily the case there's

883
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
certainly cases in the last minute

884
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,239
cancellation where

885
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,879
we would not recover the funds and um

886
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,960
like and uh and so

887
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
actually cancellation can often cause a

888
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,079
loss of money

889
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,399
because if if we if because the of

890
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,159
course the venue fees are being covered

891
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,560
by the dues which we are refunding

892
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,960
and so if we can't recover the due if we

893
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,760
can't recover the

894
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,079
the venue costs and and refund the fees

895
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,199
then we'll actually take a big loss on

896
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,159
that cancellation

897
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,760
so i don't think it's a generally i hope

898
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
applicable statement that that the itf

899
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,119
is saving money there

900
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,720
um in terms of the uh language

901
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,960
that you proposed i mean i think what

902
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,720
you actually wrote was something of the

903
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,880
nature of like if any

904
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
local regional or national authority

905
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,720
says that it's unsafe to travel there

906
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,760
um uh that like that would be grounds to

907
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,359
cancel and that that seemed

908
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,119
really expensive maybe it's not what you

909
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,560
meant um so

910
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,800
i'm i invite some additional language

911
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,160
there the other thing about the

912
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,960
contracts

913
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,000
is um so to to for a little background

914
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,200
for people so one thing i pointed out

915
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,880
that in 2020

916
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,760
our insurance contracts um would

917
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,359
reimburse us for cancellation if there

918
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,079
was a u.s

919
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,320
travel advisory to a certain place so

920
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,400
that obviously has a big bearing on the

921
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,440
fiscal result

922
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,079
of cancellation and that's one reason we

923
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,200
put it and the fact that it's in the

924
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,640
contract is

925
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,200
gives us the fact that it's in the

926
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,800
contract gives us good reason to believe

927
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,640
that the financial cover will be better

928
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
if we cancel

929
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,040
uh with that advisory so again i'm open

930
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
to other language here i i really

931
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,240
would like to make it have it be fairly

932
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,480
prescriptive rather than making the llc

933
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,079
to sort of

934
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,560
pick like some authorities based on

935
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,119
things

936
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,280
and like if you have specific issues

937
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,400
with the ukfo

938
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,280
i'm i'm happy to suggest a different

939
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,000
second

940
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,800
alternative um preferably english

941
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,920
speaking because

942
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,359
there's often nuanced in these things

943
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,079
and again the llc staff speaks english

944
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,800
um at least so uh you know i'd be happy

945
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,240
to go australia new zealand or even

946
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,200
maybe india

947
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,839
um or or some other anglophone country

948
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:32,320
or

949
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,160
some other country that publishes stuff

950
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,599
in english but

951
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,400
um uh you know beyond that i'm not sure

952
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,160
what to say so i'll open it open up to

953
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,440
the queue now

954
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,240
yeah thanks martin and and uh jody uh

955
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,680
thanks for the comment right like so

956
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,960
well a couple of things i wanted to

957
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,400
mention like one of the things is like

958
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,680
it's not clear that the

959
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,480
um uh the contracts like are not

960
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,160
confidential right so some of the times

961
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,040
like and i think like

962
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,800
probably jason is on the meeting right

963
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,720
like if he wants to like chime in right

964
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,240
but a lot of the times like the

965
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,920
contracts might be confidential so it's

966
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,760
kind of hard for us to

967
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,079
verify as a community what's in there

968
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:06,880
right so i think

969
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,280
um putting in some kind of sources in

970
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,400
there is interesting

971
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
and and the second thing is kind of we

972
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
need to look at where the participants

973
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,520
come from right like you know

974
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,720
um so maybe um like there needs to be

975
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,480
some kind of waiting for that as well

976
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,880
right like an and i think like martin i

977
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,079
don't know it was you who said right

978
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:24,400
like

979
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,599
hey there's if there was a u-wide uh uh

980
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,280
like advisory somewhere we could take

981
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,720
that right and and i think

982
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
that could be a fair play so if you can

983
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,400
help us jody right like i know you do a

984
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,119
lot of these

985
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,040
things in the uh looking at like a lot

986
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
of the advisories and everything from

987
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,920
the use so if you can point us to some

988
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,960
source there

989
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,960
uh to add in us like a third source i

990
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,480
think that will be good so like

991
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,720
and i fully agree it shouldn't be

992
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,000
discriminatory

993
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,400
uh but like the the only way to handle

994
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
it is like probably add more sources

995
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,480
that

996
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,240
you feel will balance out the thing

997
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
rather than and taking out one more

998
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,839
thing and just letting the us stand

999
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,280
there right i think that

1000
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,599
probably the is the best way forward

1001
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,839
thanks so suggest text uh jodi thank you

1002
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,839
there's no one else in the queue i

1003
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,240
believe so so just to uh conclude

1004
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,160
um so i will make uh

1005
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,240
i will make the the non-country what i

1006
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,839
view on controversial changes that jay

1007
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,560
suggested

1008
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,359
i will uh play with the formulation of

1009
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,400
some of these things

1010
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,200
um i haven't heard anything about the

1011
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,560
isg

1012
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,200
llc split issue that jay raised that i

1013
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,160
mentioned i

1014
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,560
i mean i'm inclined to probably go with

1015
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,079
the compromise that i suggested which is

1016
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,599
that there's this very high 80

1017
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,640
threshold and that the the isg has some

1018
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,480
discretion below that

1019
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,000
number um to to further to cancel the

1020
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
meeting anyway

1021
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,560
um unless somebody speaks up about it so

1022
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,760
i would expect to see those changes in

1023
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,000
the draft um i i'm

1024
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,800
i'm searching for a new so i'm hearing a

1025
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,720
lot of pushback on this

1026
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,920
refund travel cost idea both the mike

1027
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,200
and in the jabber um i'm

1028
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,880
i'm open to a formulation on

1029
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,839
on this uh for on this travel advisory

1030
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,240
thing

1031
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,560
uh but i don't think i've seen it yet in

1032
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
the thread so i don't know what changes

1033
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,599
i'm gonna make at this time

1034
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,200
unless i see something that worked i

1035
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,880
think works

1036
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,640
thank you thanks brother thank you

1037
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,520
um i don't see anybody else in the queue

1038
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,960
i'll give you a couple of minutes

1039
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
if somebody wants to get in the queue

1040
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
while i line up

1041
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:43,839
charles's presentation

1042
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,480
charles if you can come up

1043
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,160
yep okay great yeah thanks so um

1044
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,800
yeah so this draft i presented at ihf

1045
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,839
109 as well running an ietf hackathon

1046
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,920
it's not specifically just for running

1047
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,839
the hackathon from the perspective

1048
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,960
of uh online only meetings it's really

1049
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,119
about running the hackathon overall

1050
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,160
but has um some discussion in there

1051
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,560
about

1052
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,760
aspects of it which are pertinent to to

1053
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,839
online meetings to remote participation

1054
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,400
into online only meetings as well

1055
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,079
so the changes um this version that's

1056
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,560
posted now zero to the current version

1057
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,760
basically all the feedback from iatf 109

1058
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,280
and the things we learned from that

1059
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
hackathon

1060
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,200
we made some enhancements uh in

1061
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,640
preparation for

1062
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,520
uh that the one for iegf 110 which we

1063
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,920
just had last week

1064
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,280
and so there's some information about

1065
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,200
those that i added then the other thing

1066
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,920
was

1067
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,000
in going through this process realizing

1068
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,800
that although online only is a big focus

1069
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,319
of you know this working group and uh

1070
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,160
and that was the way i stated it in the

1071
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,920
draft that really a lot of what we were

1072
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,400
adding in there for online only

1073
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,760
is just important for remote

1074
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,680
participation in general so

1075
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,160
changing uh the way it's described it to

1076
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,839
indicate that

1077
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,400
and then uh this the current draft was

1078
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,000
also shared with the uh

1079
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
it was discussed during the hackathon

1080
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,280
itself last week

1081
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,560
and and shared on that list so expecting

1082
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,240
some good comments to come back

1083
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,400
from those who who were participating in

1084
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,319
these online hackathons

1085
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:49,040
next slide please the uh

1086
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,720
one big change i wanted to point out and

1087
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,880
this really came about as a result of

1088
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,640
comments from from several people i

1089
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,040
think

1090
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,680
at the last ietf meeting of 109. and

1091
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,040
that was broadening

1092
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,400
the uh the scope uh and the example i

1093
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,240
i have here is taken from the abstract

1094
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,839
and um i think this more accurately

1095
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,319
reflects the current spirit of the

1096
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,160
hackathon that we want

1097
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,920
um initially it was focused as being

1098
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,760
just for or at least worded as being

1099
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,280
only for developers

1100
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,680
of course we know we've moved from that

1101
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,880
uh

1102
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,119
we want to be able to attract developers

1103
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,319
this kind of a

1104
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,560
missing entity or an underrepresented

1105
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,839
entity in the ietf

1106
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,440
but it's really for the whole ietf

1107
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,359
community and what we see is it's very

1108
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,599
valuable to uh

1109
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,440
people who aren't developers subject

1110
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,520
matter experts of all sorts

1111
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,319
and and so captured that the other thing

1112
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,680
was

1113
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,680
it was initially stated as showing

1114
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,800
examples

1115
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
focusing on showing examples of

1116
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
practical implementations of ietf

1117
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,680
standards

1118
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,359
and we know that people use it for much

1119
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,599
more than that it really has to do with

1120
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,760
a running code related to any existing

1121
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,319
or evolving or proposed

1122
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,440
ietf standards so i made those two

1123
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,200
changes in the abstract but you'll see

1124
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,399
that reflected throughout

1125
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,839
next slide

1126
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,920
uh this was thanks to to benson uh we

1127
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,280
added an html

1128
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,000
uh template for project presentations a

1129
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,359
key part of the hackathon

1130
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,520
is the uh the presentations that we do

1131
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,560
at the end

1132
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,160
where people show hey this is what we

1133
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,599
actually accomplished

1134
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,839
and um really focusing on the

1135
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,520
information that's going to come back to

1136
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:33,920
the

1137
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,599
ietf working group to uh to move the

1138
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,520
you know the ietf standards that are

1139
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,040
involved forward

1140
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,839
so we had a powerpoint template which

1141
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:44,319
people

1142
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,359
were welcome to use and many did and

1143
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,200
spencer pointed out it'd be really nice

1144
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,960
to have an html template it actually

1145
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,480
plays nicer with

1146
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,000
with github and some of the change

1147
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,440
tracking tools and it's just much

1148
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,800
lighter weight and

1149
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,520
uh you know very lightweight format for

1150
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,680
people to use so we added that

1151
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,599
there are some technical problems with

1152
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,119
it uh currently

1153
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,839
and benson pointed that out to me so i'm

1154
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,359
going to try to fix that and

1155
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,040
and probably get benson's help to do

1156
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,560
that as well and then i'll update the

1157
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,440
draft accordingly

1158
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,560
next slide please

1159
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,640
the previous meeting we talked about

1160
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,160
sponsor benefits

1161
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,040
and um this is not really needed

1162
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,560
necessarily for actually running the

1163
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,240
hackathon but

1164
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,160
we're talking about you know having free

1165
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
options for things and the hackathon

1166
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
currently is free for everyone and

1167
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,680
so obviously there's costs and so um

1168
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,079
the feeling was it was important to say

1169
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:40,720
what

1170
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,280
sponsors actually get out of it and so

1171
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,119
um there was some information added

1172
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,680
in the draft and now the uh the

1173
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,880
sponsorship that the ietf has has been

1174
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,880
kind of revamped a bit where there's a

1175
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,400
running code sponsor

1176
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,160
i haven't added that to the draft but

1177
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,280
there's a github issue to track that

1178
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,880
so so that will get added in the next

1179
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,280
version

1180
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,599
next slide uh yeah so creating a

1181
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,640
an email alias you know going through

1182
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:10,960
this

1183
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,680
documentation process i realized hey

1184
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,040
there are several places where the

1185
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,119
chairs are emailed directly as the

1186
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,720
contacts

1187
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,880
using their personal uh or you know work

1188
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,160
email address

1189
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,400
and uh it's obviously better to have an

1190
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,280
alias for that

1191
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,200
so we just did the same thing we do for

1192
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,440
working groups basically

1193
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,680
asked the secretariat to create an alias

1194
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,839
and now we're using that everywhere

1195
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,160
and so that's been updated in the draft

1196
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,599
as well

1197
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,599
next slide and as i mentioned the

1198
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,319
online only there were several places

1199
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,040
where we

1200
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,319
removed this and changed it to focus

1201
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,319
more on you know these are aspects that

1202
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,079
help support remote participation in

1203
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:52,960
general

1204
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,599
and the examples here highlighted are

1205
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:56,960
webex accounts for

1206
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,720
hackathon project leads that they can

1207
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,800
use you know for their team

1208
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,880
it's really helpful for meeting with

1209
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,440
remote participants even if you're at an

1210
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,640
in-person meeting the use of gather

1211
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,240
the expectation is that will actually

1212
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,000
stick around after we start

1213
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,760
meeting in person again and then um

1214
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,000
yeah so switching the expenses that were

1215
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,720
identified as being for online only

1216
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,680
uh meetings to really being aspects that

1217
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,160
are needed for remote participation

1218
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,599
that was done as well

1219
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,680
okay so next steps um

1220
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,720
fix the uh the html template

1221
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,200
stuff i mentioned we're using github for

1222
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,640
tracking issues so address

1223
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,760
those and then uh incorporate feedback

1224
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,440
from based on what we learned from this

1225
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,119
ietf hackathon and

1226
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,319
and hopefully some good discussion

1227
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,440
that's going to happen here and on the

1228
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,960
mailing list

1229
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,000
next slide so specific questions for the

1230
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,200
working group

1231
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,119
so we just had a discussion here about

1232
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,960
fees and um

1233
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,800
you know what the hackathon draft says

1234
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,560
is that the hackathon is

1235
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,720
is free but we're not assuming uh

1236
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,160
although i'd love for it to always stay

1237
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,680
free for everyone

1238
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,280
in the event it didn't the thought was

1239
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,280
hey we need to cover

1240
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,640
or thought it was important to cover um

1241
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,119
remote participation the hackathon so so

1242
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,319
in case you weren't following that

1243
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,280
discussion before

1244
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,599
wondering where that came from that was

1245
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,960
kind of what i had in mind when i

1246
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,559
brought it up and

1247
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,400
i think we have a workable solution i

1248
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,119
just forwarded an email to list

1249
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,200
to kind of kick that discussion back

1250
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,160
back up and hopefully wrap it up

1251
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,520
um but then uh as we figure that out

1252
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,920
then do we need to talk about uh meeting

1253
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,280
fees anymore

1254
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,040
in the draft i would just like other

1255
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,119
people's opinion on this

1256
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,400
uh i think it's okay as is but uh it'd

1257
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,359
certainly be helpful

1258
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:53,839
as we're thinking about fees in general

1259
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,280
so the next thing um there was actually

1260
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,720
a bit of a discussion in the chat

1261
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,720
this is out perhaps out of scope for

1262
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,280
this meeting but

1263
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
the the feedback from the online

1264
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,559
hackathon has been

1265
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,240
good and that people are like hey you

1266
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,520
know it's great that we're having it

1267
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,720
this is useful

1268
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,119
we're getting some some good things done

1269
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:13,760
but i think

1270
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,880
uh i have the

1271
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,359
feedback each time has been it's

1272
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:20,160
certainly not

1273
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,880
better than or certainly not doesn't

1274
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,119
replace the in-person experience

1275
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,280
and a lot of the social interaction the

1276
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,520
productivity the participation

1277
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,200
it all suffers and we've certainly seen

1278
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,839
that in terms of the number of people

1279
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,000
presenting

1280
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,319
participating the number of projects we

1281
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,319
have how many people actually work on

1282
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,000
each project a lot of the projects just

1283
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,839
have one or two people now

1284
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,680
instead of those nice group projects

1285
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,160
that had you know a dozen or more

1286
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,599
so it's clear from the hackathon

1287
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,000
participants that you know we're really

1288
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,079
missing the in-person events

1289
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,359
um and then you know we have metrics and

1290
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,400
also we do hackathon surveys so

1291
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,839
that was another thing i'm wondering if

1292
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,440
it should be captured

1293
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,680
so uh i would love some discussion on

1294
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,200
these things you know as soon as i

1295
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,960
finish going through them all or on the

1296
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,079
list

1297
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,040
and then the last question would be um

1298
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,000
at itf 109 we confirmed that

1299
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,680
that this group was a good place to work

1300
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,319
on this draft

1301
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,520
and i feel like it's in pretty good

1302
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,920
shape now to where

1303
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
i'm hoping it can be adopted by the

1304
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,240
working group as a working group draft

1305
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,839
maybe more of a question for the chairs

1306
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,480
than just for the working group but uh

1307
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,640
anyways those are the questions and love

1308
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,880
to get some uh

1309
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,319
uh discussion going on them or anything

1310
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,760
else

1311
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,960
thanks schultz go ahead media

1312
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,040
yeah actually thanks for writing this i

1313
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,880
think it's useful to document all these

1314
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,359
things

1315
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,079
um because you said like the feedback

1316
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,839
you get is kind of kind of positive but

1317
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,000
you're missing the in-person meetings

1318
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,640
so my experience was a little bit that

1319
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,240
it's somehow a completely different

1320
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,520
thing right and at the in-person

1321
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,880
meetings you just walk around you talk

1322
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,240
to random people

1323
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,800
discuss all kind of things well now

1324
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,480
where the hackathon is like a full week

1325
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,240
you can actually meet up

1326
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,079
kind of every day discuss different

1327
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,200
things you have like completely

1328
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,880
different opportunities

1329
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,599
uh i would i would even like to kind of

1330
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:20,319
keep those

1331
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,160
unfortunately usually this week before

1332
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,680
the ietf meeting it's where you sit a

1333
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,240
lot of

1334
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,200
time in the airplane so you can't really

1335
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:27,920
participate

1336
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,520
at the hackathon but maybe that's

1337
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,599
something to to consider that like when

1338
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,359
we move back to in person that you maybe

1339
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,440
want to add something

1340
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,720
to that where you have like a

1341
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,240
pre-meeting the monday before or

1342
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,960
whatever

1343
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,559
um to like also keep some of the

1344
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,280
benefits we see right now

1345
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,880
yeah that's a good point that's

1346
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,480
something we've talked about doing

1347
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,640
we've had like pre-hackathon calls but

1348
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,480
they've been a little more focused on

1349
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,520
the

1350
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,359
uh i don't know the running of the

1351
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,000
hackathon i guess the the flow of how

1352
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,480
the event goes as opposed to

1353
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,280
uh getting work started on your projects

1354
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,160
um

1355
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,839
but certainly we've always encouraged

1356
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,760
people to work on projects leading into

1357
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,640
the hackathon and many groups do

1358
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,680
and then we have the code lounge

1359
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,599
that we keep throughout the ietf meeting

1360
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,400
week

1361
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,720
to kind of promote and give us space for

1362
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,640
working on hackathon projects and we've

1363
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,640
seen that actually get used a fair bit

1364
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,920
so um yeah good point

1365
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,160
i think the code lounge aspect covers me

1366
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,839
during the meeting and

1367
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,079
but before the meeting it would probably

1368
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,720
be helpful to have something so

1369
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,559
yeah what i've seen is that i think a

1370
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,240
lot of people actually took like

1371
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,720
some time away to just do some hacking

1372
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,280
this week before the itf meeting

1373
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,000
um and and that's a positive thing but

1374
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,480
then

1375
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,680
at the same time if you have to fly

1376
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,160
somewhere whatever that's much harder

1377
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,119
so you don't know how to observe that

1378
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:53,520
actually

1379
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,920
that's that's when a lot of us do uh uh

1380
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,359
the best coding though because you're

1381
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,000
completely offline usually so it's like

1382
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,480
i know

1383
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,319
like i have no idea how you do this on

1384
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,000
your small screen and it's in an

1385
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,440
airplane squeeze in an airplane but like

1386
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,310
i know people do that

1387
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,040
[Music]

1388
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,480
better ice media better eyes

1389
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,079
niels go ahead

1390
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,720
a lot for your uh uh thanks i'm sorry

1391
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,160
thanks a lot for your work on this

1392
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,839
charles and we've uh

1393
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,680
uh been participating in the hackathon

1394
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,839
quite a bit and doing it online

1395
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:30,800
changed the dynamics um when we were

1396
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,319
having it in person

1397
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:35,359
we would get um walk-ins from people who

1398
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,119
had excellence coding skills

1399
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,200
but now we do it online we have a lot of

1400
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,440
new first-time participants to the

1401
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,160
project

1402
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,839
and people that now are also interested

1403
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,520
in participating into the

1404
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,319
in the ietf which the barrier is lower

1405
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,640
because there's also the fee waiver

1406
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,119
so we're getting in quite a lot of fresh

1407
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,440
blood and for them the hackathon is also

1408
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,520
a relatively low barrier of entry so i

1409
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,720
think that is

1410
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,559
that's also a real nice function of the

1411
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,400
hackathon which might

1412
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,440
be a bit more foregrounded in the uh in

1413
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,720
the draft as well

1414
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,119
because aside from running code i think

1415
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,440
it's also a place where a lot of

1416
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,800
new people feel a lower barrier of entry

1417
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,119
in the ietf to integrate it a bit more

1418
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,839
perhaps the ietf plenary could be used

1419
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,599
to present some of the outcomes of the

1420
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:24,559
hackathon

1421
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,640
of course not all and not necessarily a

1422
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,480
winner but maybe some

1423
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,720
some highlights maybe some things you

1424
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,160
found or others found

1425
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,920
i know you've given presentations but

1426
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,160
maybe some getting some people and some

1427
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,839
highlights might be cool

1428
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,040
um furthermore the track wiki feels a

1429
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,640
bit fragile

1430
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,079
um if it didn't the champions might

1431
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,440
update it a bit more

1432
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,200
with like daily updates where they've

1433
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,559
got uh uh

1434
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,599
with a bit of a schedule links

1435
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,960
and maybe even tickets but i'll i'll

1436
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,720
i'll leave that to others so those were

1437
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,880
my two cents thank but thanks a lot for

1438
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,680
organizing

1439
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,680
and uh yeah thanks and i think like one

1440
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,200
thing is like you know there is usually

1441
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,599
a summary of the hackathon

1442
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,200
in the plenary is there something

1443
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,559
specific you're looking for nils in

1444
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:13,920
there or like you know you think it

1445
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,640
should be

1446
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,599
expanded from what it is today or uh

1447
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,800
just trying to ask like

1448
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,880
um because there is something there i

1449
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,640
thought it would be nice if maybe some

1450
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,640
of the projects would have some space so

1451
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,920
that also people are

1452
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,480
more relatively new have a bit more uh

1453
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,520
uh

1454
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,400
time in the sun and to integrate them a

1455
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,200
bit further

1456
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,280
in the community and get them a bit more

1457
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,960
visibility of the super cool and

1458
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,000
interesting work

1459
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,920
and generally people also love to see

1460
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,040
new work right

1461
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,400
so that's fun thank you

1462
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,359
yeah so just a couple things we we do so

1463
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:48,240
um

1464
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,280
you know we we rely first on the uh the

1465
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,760
closing of the hackathon so

1466
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,960
um you know that's when the

1467
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,960
presentations actually happen and that

1468
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,480
does get recorded so

1469
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,240
in this case this was that was friday

1470
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,920
last week but then

1471
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,240
um you know i've noticed in several

1472
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,000
working group meetings that i've gone to

1473
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,280
or been in that have the hackathons

1474
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,200
with the projects that the teams worked

1475
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,960
on related to the working group have

1476
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,079
been presented

1477
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,240
in the netconf that was the case in the

1478
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,280
uh

1479
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,079
nmrg meeting that was the case and and

1480
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,760
several others so

1481
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,319
uh we've opted more for presenting them

1482
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:24,799
in the

1483
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,400
uh uh in the working group sessions and

1484
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,559
in more detail just because in the

1485
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,240
plenary we did that a couple times and

1486
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,680
that was really important when we were

1487
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,280
just starting to get the word out about

1488
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,480
the hackathon but it

1489
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,480
it did take up a good chunk of time and

1490
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,400
unless you go in a certain depth it's

1491
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,680
hard to

1492
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,680
relate to a broad audience with uh

1493
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,000
like how important the work was the

1494
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,280
working group gets it

1495
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,599
but unless you spend some time it's hard

1496
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:53,920
unless you're a really good presenter to

1497
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,160
to figure out what's going to resonate

1498
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,520
with people so

1499
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,280
um uh but we could look at that again

1500
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,480
the other thing is the uh hack demo

1501
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,440
happy hour

1502
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,040
you know we only do that at in-person

1503
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,880
events but that's the monday

1504
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,040
after the hackathon it's kind of a

1505
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,119
social thing where

1506
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,720
anyone who wants to present their

1507
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,240
project can

1508
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,000
be there sort of at a demo table and

1509
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,359
have those more in-depth

1510
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,280
interactive discussions with people who

1511
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,960
who wander by

1512
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,319
so um we don't have anything like that

1513
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,880
for online only meetings

1514
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,480
but maybe we could look to do something

1515
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,160
to replace that

1516
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,160
