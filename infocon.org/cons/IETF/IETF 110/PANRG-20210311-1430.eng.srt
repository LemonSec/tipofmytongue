1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,279
you

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,720
you are indeed sending video um

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,559
if you mean to send video that's cool

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,080
but generally we keep this off

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,920
uh issues until all right

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,800
all right i don't know shall we start

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
because we have pretty past agenda and i

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,719
guess

9
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,280
no one has nobody has excuses of

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,040
changing the meeting rooms right

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
walking from one room to another

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
shopping for cookies

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
so i'll do the interest librarian

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,320
so welcome to the the energy

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,800
session of itf 110.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,480
this is a note well which i guess most

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:00,960
of us

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,600
most of you have seen already but you if

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,720
you have not

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,080
please take a look and by the way the

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,360
agenda

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,080
should have links to all the slides so

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,119
you can click on those links

24
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
instead of looking in my shared screen

25
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,560
because i think it might be too small

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,200
so yeah brian kindly agreed to keep an

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
eye on the chat

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,079
i'll and jabber room should be bridged

29
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,720
there so we should be good here

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
so here is our agenda i think we'll

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,200
start with some

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,320
research group business when brian and

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,880
spencer will give us some updates on the

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,759
drafts which we are still trying to

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,119
publish

36
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,560
and then we'll talk about past

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,720
properties and then we'll

38
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,680
talk a bit about security and trust

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
relationships and they have a

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,560
few drops of interest here so

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,759
any last minute agenda bashing

42
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,878
any suggestions did i miss anything

43
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,480
one two three sold so i guess

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,280
brand the floor is yours and as far as i

45
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,760
know you don't have any slides right

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,000
uh yeah i don't um i don't really need

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
visual age for this point because it

48
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,760
would be

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,160
like essentially um one or two lines of

50
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,520
text on a white screen

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
uh and you can just listen to me say

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,720
those things

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,080
um so since the last time uh we met

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
uh those of you have been following the

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
list have seen that we um

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,720
put out a uh refw sent the document up

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,280
to

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,480
the um irsg for review um

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
and uh put out a revision to address

60
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,239
some of the comments that we got

61
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,879
um during that review uh one of the

62
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
uh so after that came in we got a a a

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,840
good question from adrian farrell which

64
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,120
started some conversation

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
on the list about okay well we have this

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
kind of fuzzy idea about

67
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,080
what um you know path of where

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,959
networking is

69
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,360
but we haven't really defined path and

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,879
we'd already kind of had this problem a

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,239
little bit with the questions draft

72
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:10,879
which we will

73
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,319
um speak about shortly uh and how we

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:14,720
should

75
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,040
you know um fix that you know sort of

76
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,000
like the priority

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,920
inversion with respect to how can you

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
talk about what pathway we're networking

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,120
is if you don't know what a path is

80
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,360
um i'd actually like to um

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,120
uh take the rest of this i'm gonna

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,760
be sort of quick here so we can start

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,640
early

84
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,159
and take the rest of this to the

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,159
conversation after the path properties

86
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,200
draft

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,319
um so with no hats on other than the

88
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,640
editor of this document

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
i would say the inversion is okay

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,879
because questions is supposed to be

91
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,640
questions right like and what is a path

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
that's a perfectly reasonable question

93
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,319
um however if we think that there's sort

94
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,560
of like a a um

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,000
uh a semantic issue uh with

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
trying to define the questions without

97
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,040
defining the terminology for those

98
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,920
questions

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,840
um i think the right place to address

100
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,760
that is in the discussion on the path

101
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
properties draft um

102
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,680
so uh that's where we are in questions

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,879
uh i'd like to have a little bit of that

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,840
conversation today

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,399
take it to the list um take the outcome

106
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,600
of that conversation

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
turn it into a uh

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,400
an updated version of the questions uh

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
draft um to send out for

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,960
sort of another round of discussion and

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
then we can get it published

112
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
uh so if anyone has any particular um

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,440
uh questions or points to make about

114
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
that plan we should discuss that now

115
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
otherwise i'd say we follow that plan

116
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,680
and use sort of the remainder of my time

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,400
uh

118
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
after the path properties um discussion

119
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,680
to

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
um discuss sort of like next steps with

121
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,719
the what is a path question

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
any meta questions

123
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880

not to do has been since it left the

139
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
research group uh next slide please um

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
we've actually been kind of busy we've

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,360
gotten comments

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,120
and these have been not most of these

143
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,720
have been non-blocking comments

144
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
like especially the ones from the isg

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
and things like that on

146
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,000
uh that where we did dash 17

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,319
and all of this stuff has been

148
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,360
on the mailing list previously uh but

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
the ecn stuff

150
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,759
is just was just submitted this past

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,880
monday

152
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
uh i posted texts previously but uh

153
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,080
but uh it's good for it's good for the

154
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
research group to see what

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,639
i'm actually saying um

156
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
so uh next slide please

157
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,600
so uh martin said why not ecn during the

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,639
ietf

159
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
isg conflict review um

160
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
and you know the the easy answer was

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
nobody contributed a section on ecn but

162
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,919
that seemed kind of lame

163
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,600
uh we aren't actually covering

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
everything but we wanted to cover all

165
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,319
the lessons

166
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,599
and after i talked with brian a bit

167
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,759
ecn did actually have lessons learned

168
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,360
that weren't covered elsewhere so i

169
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,880
wrote a section on

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
ecn and updated the lessons learned in

171
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,599
the draft

172
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,319
and i want to do a shout out to sally

173
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:04,960
floyd's

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,840
ecn page which was still active and very

175
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,720
helpful

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
so i like i say submitted dash 18 on

177
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,280
monday

178
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,000
with the text that i had said to the

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
melee list previously

180
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,360
and uh next slide please

181
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,800
um so

182
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
um

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,880
yeah so so what was what was different

184
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,759
about acn

185
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
uh was that these guys did a lot so much

186
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:34,960
right

187
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
the lessons from our doc which hadn't

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,199
been written yet um

189
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,120
thinking about incremental deployment

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,280
and impact on router throughput

191
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,759
and trust issues between the node and

192
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
the network but they didn't anticipate

193
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
that routers would flat out crash

194
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,039
when you said non-zero ecm bits

195
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,240
so and this was actually

196
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
a want to do a shout out to uh

197
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
dave thaler and his team at microsoft uh

198
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
they did a presentation

199
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,039
uh which is reference to the draft uh

200
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,639
about this and basically

201
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,400
said you know like this is one of the

202
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
more duh comments i've

203
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,599
seen at itf they said if you crash the

204
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
router you can't recover that at the tcp

205
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,720
layer

206
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,039
um so they turn they ship vista with ecn

207
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,400
turned off

208
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,639
because the router that was crashing was

209
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,160
a popular model from a

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,759
popular router vendor and uh

211
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
once you've turned it off you really

212
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,120
don't have much incentive to turn it

213
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,399
back on

214
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,640
uh and that log jam can persist for a

215
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,039
decade or two uh people are starting to

216
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,519
turn the ecn back on now but i mean this

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
is from you know like 10 or 15 years

218
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
later

219
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
um so the the

220
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,320
lesson learned that i took away from

221
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,160
that experience was

222
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
sometimes you get one chance to get it

223
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,439
right next slide please

224
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
so my questions are did we do the right

225
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
thing by including this contribution

226
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,640
because this was a this is a significant

227
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,200
text

228
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
late in the process that the research

229
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,839
group needs to see

230
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
and

231
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,839
martin duke asked is there a better way

232
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,800
to describe

233
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,959
the ecn lesson than just one chance

234
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,399
so i'd be interested in hearing things

235
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,720
about that and we talked

236
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
and i talked more about this my next

237
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
presentation but we talk about whether

238
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,839
lessons are

239
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,880
uh invariant

240
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
so well you know in this in and that's

241
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,240
what

242
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,200
my my suggestion was well understood and

243
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,959
likely to be applicable to any pan

244
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,320
solution

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
uh so my suggested uh path forward is to

246
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,320
get comments

247
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,959
uh on the mailing list due in two weeks

248
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,240
after ietf

249
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
and that i submit a dash 19 reflecting

250
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
those comments for

251
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
private final approval by colin which i

252
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,720
believe is the last

253
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,399
uh stop for us so

254
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,800
i should

255
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,320
a good question to ask is has anybody

256
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,279
looked at this text

257
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,959
probably um

258
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,319
brian i see you in the queue

259
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,680
uh so yeah as an individual i i have

260
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
looked at this text

261
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
uh i i think it's good i would say i

262
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,920
would make

263
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,240
like a tiny little knit here is like is

264
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
there a better way to describe dcm

265
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,959
lesson than one chance

266
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,640
it well i mean it wasn't one chance

267
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
we're doing it again it's possibly one

268
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,079
chance every two decades

269
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:40,540
um

270
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,000
[Laughter]

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,640
right like so there are uh there might

272
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,079
be something to say about sort of like

273
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,839
equipment replacement cycles

274
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,680
uh like if you have to if you have to

275
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,079
forklift hardware um it's gonna slow you

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,959
down

277
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
um but that's like a minor uh would be a

278
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
minor point to make there i think the

279
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
one chance is a good characterization of

280
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,519
it

281
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,360
um but yeah i think this is a good plan

282
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,640
forward again with my

283
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
without my hat on cool thank you

284
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,839
thank you uh looks like mr gory

285
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,519
how many buttons can i press at once

286
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,680
well does that work

287
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,959
now yes oh except

288
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,040
it says arrow video closed which is

289
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
really cool however you don't need to

290
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,519
see me

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,480
um so it's great spencer i'd have an

292
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
opportunity to say

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
i haven't read your text but i still

294
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,839
have an opinion

295
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,800
welcome to the ie that isn't that an

296
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,120
ietf thing

297
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,800
okay but but it's the same as

298
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,160
as brian's

299
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
we re i think we need to be really

300
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
careful to say it's one chance per

301
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,760
equipment lifetime

302
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,279
and really call that out because

303
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,880
otherwise it sounds like you're talking

304
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
about a dead experiment

305
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
because if we talked about st st2 we

306
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,920
would say

307
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
no it's gone forever whereas for this

308
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,160
it's not really gone forever

309
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,240
and the bug came because somebody read

310
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,639
the toss bite from a speck which was

311
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,519
10 years old when they did their device

312
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,639
so

313
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,160
they they were from a previous

314
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
generation they put the bug in theirs it

315
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,320
lasted for a generation um

316
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,760
yeah there's something about generations

317
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
here and i will read it and give you

318
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,800
some proper comments no problem

319
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,839
let someone else talk

320
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
okay i'm here yeah so thanks spencer for

321
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,680
um

322
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,200
taking my late comments um

323
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
i i wouldn't disagree at all with a

324
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
character with the like accuracy of the

325
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,600
one chance

326
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,279
and one chance per equipment cycle or

327
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,639
whatever it is that people want to put

328
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,440
here

329
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
uh i could my complaint is a little more

330
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
meta than that and then

331
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
i i don't understand how this is

332
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,600
actionable

333
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,839
to protocol designers i mean does this

334
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,519
just increase their stress level because

335
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,360
if they screw up like they're doomed

336
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,720
or is there something you can actually

337
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
do and i i think we talked about this a

338
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,399
little bit on the thread

339
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,519
um and you know i wasn't there so i

340
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,880
can't comment if there's something they

341
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,399
could have done to avoid this router

342
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,519
crashing problem and i think the

343
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,279
immediate feedback i got last time i

344
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,480
checked was that no there was nothing

345
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,600
they could have done there was a lot of

346
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,560
testing and

347
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,200
so now this happened but i i wonder if

348
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,320
there's a way we could

349
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,120
be more constructive than this in terms

350
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,079
of finding guidance to future efforts

351
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,120
uh if i was going to try to uh wordsmith

352
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
this on the call

353
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
on the teleconference which i would not

354
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,120
recommend

355
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
um i would i would probably be thinking

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,440
in terms of something like

357
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,880
um a broadening

358
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,720
you know you know basically think

359
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,240
outside the box on

360
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
uh the tests that you run because

361
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
you know they test they tested this

362
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,839
stuff just obviously not with that

363
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,959
router

364
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,440
and so things got awkward when that

365
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
router was in the path

366
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,480
so like i say let's let's talk about

367
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
that on the mailing list but but

368
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,720
thank you for the comment

369
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,639
uh so this is colin uh it is colin yes

370
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,000
can you hear me

371
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,880
i can hear you yes so um thank you for

372
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,920
doing the update

373
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,120
um on the um

374
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
the point of view of sort of release

375
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
cycles and so on i mean i

376
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,800
think the comments about once per

377
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,079
equipment life cycle

378
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,800
uh makes sense uh i'm wondering if

379
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
there's something which can be

380
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,320
um something that can be said about

381
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,000
structured approaches to

382
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,880
testing um because certainly when people

383
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,240
came to

384
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,440
to trying to deploy ecn again for the

385
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
second time

386
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
um my impression is that uh

387
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,040
and i guess it was apple that were

388
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,959
pushing it they they followed quite a

389
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,160
careful approach

390
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,279
to to to pushing out this

391
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,720
in an incremental way in small numbers

392
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
of devices

393
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
whilst also working with the operators

394
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,639
to to address problems

395
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,920
and this may be lessons that can be

396
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,680
learned from that

397
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,279
i i think that i think that i think

398
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
that's a good uh

399
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,399
i think that's a good um i think that's

400
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,320
a really helpful observation

401
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,800
uh just just the thing where um

402
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,279
even being able to roll operating system

403
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,079
uh

404
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,519
revisions you know which which happens

405
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,000
you know like every quarter of these

406
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
days on a lot of hosts rather than

407
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,959
every equipment cycle on a lot of hosts

408
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,920
when uh

409
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,279
when ecm was deployed the first time

410
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,040
but i think that's i think that's a i

411
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
think that's very a very

412
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
helpful suggestion to think about what

413
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
what's changed since we

414
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,639
uh you know since evcn

415
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,560
always tried to was attempted to be

416
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
deployed the first time

417
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,639
thank you colin

418
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,920
thank you uh and just in in terms of the

419
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
comments uh

420
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
you know for final final approval and so

421
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,959
on as soon as the research group's happy

422
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:15,519
i'm sure

423
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,240
i will be happy fabulous

424
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,399
so does this get us to gory

425
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,480
saying what i want to say measure before

426
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,440
and and test gently as you're deploying

427
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,040
i think are the two things we need to do

428
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
so so we're getting better at measuring

429
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,519
before with much bigger experiments

430
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
but we're also getting much better at

431
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,920
testing during that initial deployment

432
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
to see whether this is actually a show

433
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,160
stopper

434
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
if they'd seen that very early on they

435
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,279
would just stop doing this and we'd have

436
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,079
fixed the problem

437
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
yeah i think like i said i think i think

438
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,040
it's very helpful

439
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,559
thank you thank you corey uh

440
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,639
second peter eric hi eric

441
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,039
wait for our little audio bounce there

442
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,319
we go um

443
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,959
yeah just yeah i think uh we're gonna

444
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,640
close the line after jake now

445
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,199
so um i love talking about ecn as much

446
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,720
as the next person but we do have to get

447
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,579
to the rest of the

448
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,160
[Laughter]

449
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
to martin's comment i think there is

450
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,200
something that's actually

451
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,679
actionable that we could include here

452
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,039
which is and and

453
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,480
you know i agree with a lot of things

454
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
about doing it incrementally and and

455
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,919
working with operators and making sure

456
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
that we can measure as we go and those

457
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,039
are all good things

458
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,600
but at the end of the day um having a

459
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
at least where possible having a

460
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
fallback strategy or some way to ensure

461
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,840
that the end user pain is mitigated in

462
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
the event of a problem

463
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,039
um likely in this and many other cases

464
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,600
ends up being the key to whether we end

465
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,120
up turning something off

466
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,280
versus being able to keep it on while

467
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,720
things are being fixed

468
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
and so had we now that we know that

469
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
there were a lot of problems

470
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,679
we have all sorts of interesting

471
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,440
strategies and heuristics that we can

472
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,000
use to say

473
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
hmm this looks like a place where

474
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
somebody blows up when we use

475
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
ecn but you know pick anything that

476
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,880
we're doing which is part of why we have

477
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,000
this document

478
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,480
um and and we can do things to try to

479
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,280
either detect in the moment or or

480
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,640
remotely disable it

481
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
or or handle that that sort of a

482
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,640
situation and so

483
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
uh it's great to measure it's great to

484
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
be able to coordinate with people

485
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
but fundamentally if we measure and we

486
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,000
discover that there's a big problem

487
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
we still end up in the same bad bad

488
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
place so if if

489
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
we measure and we detect that there's a

490
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,039
problem and we are able to prevent that

491
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,919
problem from causing users lots of pain

492
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,000
then we can end up in a much better

493
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,360
place so that might be an actionable

494
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
thing that we could put as

495
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
other than a don't screw up your

496
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,320
protocol is like

497
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
kind of hard um but you know think about

498
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,799
the failure mode and

499
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,720
design a way to remove the user pain

500
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,000
from that failure mode

501
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,280
might allow things to be much more

502
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,840
deployable cool thank you so much

503
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,520
uh gets me to karini

504
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,960
hello hi chris hi kareem yeah hi

505
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,640
um i just want to echo some of the

506
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
comments that we heard

507
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,240
um one is you know um i like what eric

508
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,679
just said in terms of

509
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,360
not just tests but have a plan b have a

510
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,240
fallback plan but i i actually want to

511
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,720
come

512
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,360
go back to colin's comment and and your

513
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,799
response to it

514
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,000
which i liked which is

515
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
um the generation

516
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,760
uh you know that whole thing that uh

517
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,440
someone said you know is this to

518
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,799
increase stress

519
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,360
generations are reducing the length of a

520
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,480
generation

521
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,080
uh because you know if you have

522
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,760
microcode uh you can

523
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,799
you can fix things a lot quicker if if

524
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,440
people are

525
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
updating uh os's quicker then you can

526
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,159
fix things quicker so

527
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,000
the fact that it's a generation doesn't

528
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,360
mean it's a

529
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,520
you know it's not 10 years anymore it's

530
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
not you know

531
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
that long so not to take

532
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,600
anything away from what you're saying

533
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
here that we should be careful

534
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
and in many cases it is one chance the

535
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,720
problem

536
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
the main thing with the one chance is

537
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,559
not the generation as much as

538
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,120
the the taste left in your mouth if

539
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,480
something goes strong

540
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,440
and so your reluctance to retry it and

541
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,280
so we really have to and that's why i

542
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
appreciate eric's comment because

543
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,240
if you reduce the bad taste from an

544
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,080
experiment that goes wrong

545
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,640
then people will be more likely to retry

546
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
it

547
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,840
i i think that we have to be careful

548
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,760
that from 20 years ago to now the

549
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,080
generations have become a lot shorter

550
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,080
but the bad taste and people's

551
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
reluctance to try things a second

552
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,320
time is i think the bigger lesson here

553
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,559
thank you thank you kari

554
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,960
it gets me to jake yeah hi spencer

555
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,480
thanks um

556
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,280
the uh there's one i i agree the

557
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
protocol designers did a good job but

558
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
there's one thing i really think would

559
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,480
have been better

560
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,600
which is if ect1 was nect

561
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
so they went ahead and defined it with

562
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
that and and gave it

563
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,280
a meaning without uh

564
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,919
without making it different than the one

565
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,520
that's there and this has caused trouble

566
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,080
that's

567
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,120
still unfolding today if it had been any

568
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,919
ct

569
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,120
for ect1 meaning keep doing what you're

570
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,480
doing before

571
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,640
then some of the

572
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,960
current discussions would have been just

573
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
a lot smoother it seems like

574
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,559
there's a you know

575
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,000
i don't know how you fold that into a

576
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,919
generalizable thing but when you're

577
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,600
bringing up ect it might be worth

578
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,240
mentioning

579
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,840
in terms of um future compatibility

580
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,520
cool thank you jake so

581
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,960
uh i can i i have some comments now if

582
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,039
people have other comments you have two

583
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
weeks not counting this week

584
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,280
to send them in and then i will

585
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,320
submit that copy the

586
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,120
research group and uh let colin do the

587
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
right thing

588
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,960
if that works for people and

589
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,919
and thank you all for your input next

590
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,880
okay send spencer we are a bit over time

591
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
so yes there is a

592
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
the floor is yours i'm getting your

593
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,960
slice in a second

594
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,190
[Music]

595
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,879
hi here can you hear me

596
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
yeah yes i can hear you cool

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
hi i'm teresa i'm presenting an update

598
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
on a path properties draft and

599
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,159
next slide please

600
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,960
so we have published two revisions and

601
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
one was basically just addressing some

602
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
minor feedback points and now the most

603
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,000
recent revision

604
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,559
sort of speaks more generally to the

605
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,799
purpose of this draft because there was

606
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,120
a lot of discussion on terminology in

607
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,840
both the

608
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,760
questions and the what not to do draft

609
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,200
during the sort of

610
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,520
way to publication and so we were

611
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
thinking that

612
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
yes we need a generic terminology i mean

613
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
we know that that's what the

614
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
path properties draft is for and

615
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
our hope is that this terminology in a

616
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,600
draft can be useful

617
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,720
uh for pan rg to use in the other draft

618
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
and to discuss path awareness and

619
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,480
pathway networking in general

620
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,640
and then the the what not to do draft

621
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,559
right has a lot of specific terminology

622
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,840
so we were thinking

623
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,480
okay we have a generic terminology and

624
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,039
now

625
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,320
a specific technology would consider

626
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
specific path elements so right we

627
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
define a sort of an abstract or a

628
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,799
general path element but then a specific

629
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:22,480
terminology would say okay we

630
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,039
are talking about ip routers and have

631
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,279
their own definition of path element

632
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,880
and then they would sort of

633
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,279
make their own definition of a path and

634
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,120
uh define what path properties they

635
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,760
consider

636
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,000
and also what they can do about their

637
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
path right

638
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,559
uh so we hope that our terminology is

639
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,440
already

640
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,880
sort of um generic enough to cover

641
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,520
those uh relevant concepts and to be

642
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,039
potentially applicable

643
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,120
to path aware technologies that we talk

644
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,600
about in panagio which includes past

645
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,799
present and future technologies

646
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,000
but yeah i wanted to uh

647
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,360
know if um people think that uh our

648
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
terminology is already there or if

649
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,320
there's anything

650
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,200
that you are still missing and that is

651
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,000
my

652
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,679
first question and then i have one more

653
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
slide

654
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,159
okay and if there's no feedback right

655
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,840
now we can also move to the

656
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,720
next slide now

657
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,640
so in addition to that generic

658
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,559
terminology that the path properties

659
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,720
draft provides it also has a use cases

660
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,279
section

661
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,000
and an example section and so here we

662
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
thought okay so we have a

663
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
definition of paths and path awareness

664
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,679
and now it would be good to

665
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,080
have some motivation of why somebody

666
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,760
would even care about

667
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,279
path properties and that is part of why

668
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,880
the use cases section

669
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,320
exists right so we would um we have

670
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,960
uh three use cases a path selection

671
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,080
protocol selection

672
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,799
and service invocation and we think all

673
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,760
those

674
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,120
use cases are generic as well but then a

675
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,840
specific

676
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,440
technology again would sort of have

677
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,919
their own flavor of path selection right

678
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,559
it can consider different path elements

679
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,799
maybe it selects between different

680
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,039
routers that it knows about maybe it

681
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,799
selects between different

682
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,600
networks that it knows about and and

683
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
then this principle this use case of

684
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,880
path selection would sort of apply to

685
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,000
specific

686
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
different terminologies and it's useful

687
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,200
to explain the general

688
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,320
concept and so that is the use cases

689
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,880
section

690
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,279
and then we also have examples of path

691
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,440
properties and here again

692
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,039
we have okay this time i guess the

693
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,600
examples are rather specific we

694
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,679
reference specific rfcs

695
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
for example for some performance

696
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,120
properties but still it's

697
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,840
again it's illustrative of what you can

698
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,240
do

699
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,520
with path properties and so we're also

700
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,440
wondering if there's any specific use

701
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,600
cases or examples that people are still

702
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,960
missing from the path properties drafts

703
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,640
because we would like to get it closer

704
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
to publication to have a stable

705
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,600
reference

706
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,120
for other drafts

707
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
and that is actually all i had for

708
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,120
slides and now i'm hoping for some

709
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
discussion

710
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,000
brian you want to go first uh yeah

711
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,799
uh hi teresa how you doing um you'll

712
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:31,039
know

713
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,200
no hat uh this is the chair hat it's

714
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,640
over here um

715
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,000
so uh i

716
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,320
[Music]

717
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,200
i as a non-exhaustive list i like this

718
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,320
as a starting point

719
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,679
um it's it's up sets the use cases up

720
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,159
into

721
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,880
pretty broad categories the one nit that

722
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,600
i would have

723
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,640
is that um we should probably be pretty

724
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,200
clear that

725
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,960
service invocation in this case

726
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,000
refers to service as defined

727
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
in sort of like the service function

728
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,360
chaining um

729
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,279
context and not uh with respect to

730
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,320
sort of like endpoint services um maybe

731
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,919
i just see this because my day job is

732
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,000
compute these days and not networking

733
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,960
um but i could certainly see service

734
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,640
invocation and service selection

735
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
being part of the path property thing

736
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,399
right like so you have a front end

737
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,520
that's going to steer to a different

738
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
back end based on the

739
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,080
the properties the path on the other

740
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,240
side and that would be a different kind

741
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,600
of service indication and the kind of

742
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,520
service indication that you mean

743
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,960
and the kind of service invocation that

744
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
you mean is actually more important for

745
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,440
the the

746
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,679
the pan rg context so it'd be a little

747
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,039
bit more um yeah

748
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,159
that's the problem with this whole

749
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,600
document is that every word we want to

750
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,480
use is already

751
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,799
is already contextually overloaded um

752
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,399
back to the the previous question um

753
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,080
uh i think that this is actually a good

754
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,600
split as well by basically saying we're

755
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,679
going to try and build the abstract

756
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,000
um the abstract framework the abstract

757
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,600
meta terminology

758
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,960
as a um a way to build

759
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,600
the um the concrete terminology on on

760
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,039
top of it i think this is a

761
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,799
a good approach so um uh

762
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,240
yay to all of the changes up to zero two

763
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,039
um from me

764
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,679
thanks uh no

765
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,320
okay jake

766
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,679
uh yeah hi theresa um i just

767
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,039
wanted to say i've been meaning to write

768
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,720
an email i will get it out

769
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,000
uh there's a a couple of examples that i

770
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,520
think are relevant to this question

771
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,760
it's actually i i had tried to do it as

772
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,799
a follow-up to

773
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,240
michael wellesle's uh request to talk

774
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:44,720
about

775
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,640
uh um sort of discovery of on-path stuff

776
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,240
i think there's a few things that i've

777
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,159
been looking at that are

778
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,720
there in a relevant direction here um

779
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,760
that

780
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,080
actually brian's comment made me think

781
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,760
i'm not quite sure if i'm talking about

782
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,480
the same thing

783
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,200
that you're talking about but uh i i

784
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,960
will send that email i will get it out

785
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,720
uh so look for that within the

786
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,200
next couple of weeks thank you and yeah

787
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,760
i also appreciate uh comments via email

788
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,240
and or we also have a github maybe we

789
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,080
should talk about making it an

790
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,520
appointed github

791
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,440
now that the drive is adopted

792
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,480
okay great i do not see anyone else in

793
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,000
the queue and we're getting

794
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,600
back on time thanks teresa for

795
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,120
getting it short so a next presentation

796
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,600
will be about the past property

797
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,600
i just want to jump back in the queue

798
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,840
really quickly uh to go back to the

799
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,880
questions question

800
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,279
right like so there's a there is a a

801
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,120
standing question

802
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,159
as to whether we want um

803
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,000
questions to have a normative forward

804
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,159
reference to path properties for the

805
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,679
definition of a path

806
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,760
or whether we want to try and leave it

807
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,799
open

808
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,200
um so i would have a question for teresa

809
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,840
before we

810
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,039
um yes thank you for coming back uh

811
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,200
is in terms of like when we think we

812
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
might be able to publish this does it

813
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,240
make sense

814
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,919
in your mind as the editor of this

815
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,440
document to maybe take all three of

816
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,720
these documents and push them out

817
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,519
together

818
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,919
or should i um as the editor of

819
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:28,640
questions

820
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,080
try to um cut

821
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,640
uh like you know go back to sort of like

822
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
the abbreviated super abstract version

823
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,000
of path

824
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,320
um so that we can get them out the door

825
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,679
and put them in

826
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,960
like you know a uh a directed acyclic

827
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,159
graph of references

828
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,760
so i'd like to get your opinion on that

829
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,559
okay so my initial reaction is that the

830
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,159
path properties draft

831
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,000
answers the first question from the

832
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,600
questions draft so it's

833
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,440
it feels kind of silly to have a

834
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
reference to the

835
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,399
answer draft as a normative reference

836
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,120
and i'm not sure that it's actually

837
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,799
needed to have this kind of

838
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,960
clear rigorous definition i mean i don't

839
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,720
think it's necessary to have the first

840
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,360
question

841
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,519
already answered in order to publish the

842
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,440
questions draft

843
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,679
okay cool uh so i will take that in an

844
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,000
in answer to adrian farrell's uh

845
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
email which i'm now noticing was like

846
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,519
almost a month ago so i gotta get on

847
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:25,840
that

848
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
but i will take that to the list thank

849
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,279
you very much

850
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,440
okay okay spencer are you in the queue

851
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
okay we'll close the queue after you but

852
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,760
yeah i guess go ahead

853
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,840
yeah uh i just wanted to say real real

854
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,360
quickly for the working

855
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000
for the research group that uh we ended

856
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,559
up i

857
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,760
we ended up yeah i

858
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,519
i have a informative pointer to the uh

859
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,679
to the terminology draft but i do not uh

860
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,320
most of the most of the uh contributions

861
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,000
were done

862
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,240
with a range of definitions of what

863
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,440
people thought path-aware

864
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,360
networking was or whatever it was they

865
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,880
were doing at the time

866
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,200
so uh that question is not active for uh

867
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,240
that that question is not active for uh

868
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,120
what not to do

869
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,039
it's only only for the research

870
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,320
questions draft thank you

871
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,480
okay great kevin i

872
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,159
hear the floor is yours

873
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,919
hello hello

874
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,960
hi uh any anybody can hear me

875
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
yes yes we can hear you okay at least i

876
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,480
can hear you

877
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,399
hello oh

878
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,640
it seems like i can't hear it

879
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,559
um uh wilton

880
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,240
hi hello hello hello yes

881
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,840
yes can you hear us

882
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,918
i can't hear it i i don't know

883
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,040
if anybody can hear me or it is me i

884
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,440
have

885
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,839
any uh trouble with

886
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,429
connection

887
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,529
[Music]

888
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,960
okay but i can't hear

889
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,399
i can't hear you but maybe i will just

890
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,799
start

891
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,639
maybe you can um

892
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,079
since okay since everyone can hear me

893
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,280
maybe i will just start

894
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,839
maybe you can um

895
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,839
okay yes

896
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,400
uh hello everyone this is john from

897
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,520
china mobile and

898
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,560
this draft is about the required pass

899
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,640
properties for applying password

900
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,760
networking

901
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,800
in integrated space racial networks

902
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,480
and maybe it can be seen

903
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,320
as an input for teresa and hope it can

904
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,440
bring you some inspirations

905
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,720
and yes if you go to the next slide

906
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,040
please

907
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,280
uh for this slide it is about

908
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,720
the relationship between the istn

909
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,200
and the space and the path of world

910
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
networking

911
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,520
and basically

912
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,680
i just list some characteristics of

913
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,240
istn and pan and we can see whether

914
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,760
these

915
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,280
characteristics match well and for the

916
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,760
first

917
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,359
bullet uh uh uh uh

918
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,480
it is about the limited resources and uh

919
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,079
because of the

920
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,440
source of the light is the solar panel

921
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,880
so the power of the satellite is always

922
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,200
limited and so does the computing

923
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,000
resources

924
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,440
and storage resources but by taking

925
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,839
advantage of the pa and

926
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,520
we can leave the complicated

927
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,720
calculations all the selections

928
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
all these functions to the endpoint and

929
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,560
make the network

930
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,160
node as simple as possible and for the

931
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,720
second and third bullet is about the

932
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,280
cross

933
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,240
uh administrative administrative domain

934
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,000
and class layer because it is

935
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,119
uh quite possible that the isdn is a

936
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,160
is a clause uh the main is creative

937
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,800
domain and clause layers

938
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,480
while the pan is very suitable for

939
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,760
those kind of networks and for the

940
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,200
first first bullet it is about

941
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,119
the multipasses characteristics

942
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,000
the icon can be seen as a native

943
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,760
multipath network

944
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,200
networks since both space passes and

945
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,520
terrestrial passes can be used to

946
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,640
transmit traffic

947
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
and appearance can just take advantage

948
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,640
of these features

949
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,079
so it seems like the password networking

950
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,119
is suitable for istn and may help to

951
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,760
cope with some challenges of the istn

952
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,960
and then

953
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,160
if you go to the next slide we can see

954
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,200
take a look about the use cases

955
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,800
and the challenges

956
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,040
yes um this is a very brave

957
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,560
picture about the use cases and in our

958
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,880
understanding with the development of

959
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,480
the space technologies

960
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,359
and the satellite capabilities will be

961
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,320
stronger

962
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,560
and therefore the satellite can be

963
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
integrated into terrestrial

964
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,200
networks as a router or as a server

965
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,280
and can be seen as part of the access

966
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,400
networks

967
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,000
or car networks or even a data networks

968
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,839
then the use cases will be more

969
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,599
complicated than we starts

970
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,880
so there are many challenges

971
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,240
uh we need to be take care of for

972
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,480
example you need to adapt to the time

973
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,440
variant

974
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,599
topologies due to the mobility of

975
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,640
satellites

976
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,760
you need to adapt to limited resources

977
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,079
uh as i explained before and you need to

978
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,640
adapt to virus link characteristics

979
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,760
especially this the space links

980
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,000
which may have unpredictable link

981
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,359
failure and

982
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,640
moreover all these links maybe well use

983
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,160
totally different protocols so uh

984
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,720
it seems like uh so many things need to

985
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,440
be done

986
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,560
to handle these challenges and when it

987
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,440
comes to the

988
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,119
pan it will have some additional

989
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:17,920
requirements

990
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,160
on the path properties and if you go to

991
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,118
the next slide please

992
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,040
yes here i list i list the

993
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,480
requirements on path properties in istn

994
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,280
and as you can see we believe that the

995
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,160
path properties can have two

996
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,640
granularities

997
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,160
and for the course granular it may

998
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,680
contain the path properties

999
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,760
and for the fan granular properties it

1000
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,520
contains the node properties and

1001
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,560
link properties and

1002
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,119
some additional post properties are

1003
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,359
dedicated in space networks

1004
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,079
well maybe others are common properties

1005
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,920
in both terrestrial networks

1006
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,680
and uh space networks and

1007
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,960
uh i uh due to i

1008
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,599
because i i only have five minutes so i

1009
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,440
won't go through all those properties

1010
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,359
but if you have

1011
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,920
some interesting and and you can maybe

1012
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
find it in a draft

1013
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,680
and if you go to the next slide please

1014
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,359
yes it is just a brief summary um

1015
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,760
the integrated space racial networks can

1016
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,240
take advantage of the pan and thereby

1017
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,599
can be seen as a

1018
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,359
typical use cases uh and when the pan

1019
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,960
is applied into the istn the

1020
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,200
additional pass properties may have may

1021
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,720
be required

1022
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,839
and thanks for listening my humble view

1023
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,440
and hope uh it will be helpful

1024
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,520
and any suggestions are welcomed

1025
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,040
okay so i guess you cannot hear us

1026
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,040
anyway so

1027
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,000
i suggest we bring the discussion to the

1028
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,640
chat then

1029
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,960
in the mailing please sorry

1030
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,480
and because yeah we're again running

1031
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,440
over time

1032
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,000
i suggest we move to the next

1033
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,359
presentation thank you very much for

1034
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,240
presenting this

1035
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,840
i am getting the next slide

1036
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,839
[Applause]

1037
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,160
um

1038
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,160
one i am getting your slice in a second

1039
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,480
um

1040
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,319
[Music]

1041
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,520
oh sorry i am

1042
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,319
so slow

1043
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:03,839
and sure

1044
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,800
thank you jim um i guess you hear me

1045
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,200
well

1046
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,040
i think so yes i think we can hear you

1047
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,160
well

1048
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,240
all right thank you very much all right

1049
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,599
so i'm juan garcia pardo

1050
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,040
um i want to have a

1051
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,560
there we go so uh yeah

1052
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,800
since uh this is going to be a very

1053
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,720
short presentation on drk so the

1054
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,880
dynamically recreatable

1055
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,240
key infrastructure so i'm going to try

1056
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,119
to keep it in 10 minutes uh

1057
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,119
so the idea if jen if you can go to the

1058
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,319
index so let me quickly

1059
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,520
just yeah yeah sorry yeah yeah fine

1060
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:51,920
thank you

1061
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,839
so i'm just going to choose an example

1062
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,839
very early so i think it will be

1063
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,119
understood what later or what what drk

1064
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,040
can be used for in the context of

1065
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,359
source authentication and later on

1066
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,720
because we want to introduce

1067
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,640
epic as a path verification system later

1068
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,319
on also into the pan rg

1069
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,400
we thought uh let's give a let's give it

1070
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,319
a spin first into the r key which is

1071
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,000
like the basis for epic

1072
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,720
all right so the um uh after the uh the

1073
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,920
example

1074
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,480
i'm just gonna talk the minimal about

1075
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,319
the key hierarchy in the arche and then

1076
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:25,839
some details about the derivation and

1077
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,880
exchange

1078
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,520
so if you go to the next slide please um

1079
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,440
so what is the art key

1080
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,440
uh the id is just the practical for

1081
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,200
establishing an exchange

1082
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,880
symmetric photography keys that can be

1083
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,640
used for authentication

1084
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,119
and um any autonomous system that wants

1085
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,480
to opt-in to the

1086
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,760
drk protocol they will have at least one

1087
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,160
key server this is just an entity that

1088
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,520
understands the drk protocol

1089
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,240
uh so vrt was designed with scale in

1090
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,079
mind

1091
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,800
to scale with the internet and since we

1092
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,960
we cannot keep state for every um

1093
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,800
possible entity that would like to be

1094
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,040
authenticated into the internet

1095
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
the er key doesn't rely to keep in state

1096
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
for that much or for that many

1097
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,400
entities so there is this uh key tree

1098
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,720
uh that will that we'll see later into

1099
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,839
how that's

1100
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,920
used to derive the next keys and so on

1101
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,200
uh the configuration

1102
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,119
granularity is up to the autonomous

1103
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,720
system level so

1104
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,520
once we see the x the key exchange we'll

1105
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,400
understand that

1106
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,520
some uh key servers can deny requests to

1107
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,640
uh whole autonomous system entities over

1108
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,040
there

1109
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,839
next slide please

1110
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,720
all right so um i have to introduce

1111
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,440
these uh

1112
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,359
key levels already because otherwise the

1113
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,960
example will not be understood uh there

1114
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,680
are three

1115
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,160
levels key levels uh levels here one and

1116
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,839
two the level series also called the

1117
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,040
secret value

1118
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,280
uh there is just a key that is uh

1119
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,319
originated into

1120
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,960
one yes and the owner of that key and is

1121
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,560
always kept in secret inside that key

1122
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,119
server

1123
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,760
that is the key used to derive the level

1124
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,400
one keys

1125
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,160
those are the as2aes keys that

1126
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
could have logged the protocol in this

1127
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,960
context protocol is just the purpose

1128
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,119
of that key so for instance to

1129
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,800
authenticate dns

1130
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,520
request packets let's say this is just a

1131
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,359
string a string of bytes

1132
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,359
and then the level two key is derived

1133
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:22,480
using the level one

1134
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,319
key we'll see the details in the

1135
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:25,839
variation very quickly

1136
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,680
and then is that's the actual key that

1137
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,119
is used to uh

1138
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,720
uh tag the packet so you can do the

1139
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,560
maximum on those packets

1140
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,480
so every key has a validity period that

1141
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,079
is inherited from the previous

1142
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,040
level and the level zero is the first is

1143
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,839
the actual

1144
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,720
uh level that establishes the validity

1145
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,440
and then

1146
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,720
uh every entity uh that is part of the

1147
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,079
communication will derive

1148
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,640
that key in either one one of two ways

1149
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,240
so the owners of the key can derive it

1150
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,200
in nanoseconds

1151
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,920
um and any other entity which is not the

1152
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,839
owner of the key

1153
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,760
s will have to obtain the key via their

1154
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,440
key sir and they will see how that

1155
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,079
actually works also very quickly uh next

1156
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,160
slide please

1157
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,920
so uh this is just the um um

1158
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,720
just a picture to to remind uh that the

1159
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,079
level zero key never leaves

1160
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,800
uh the key server and we're seeing the

1161
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,720
same time the same the same key so this

1162
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,400
is the little zero one and two keys for

1163
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,359
the same key

1164
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,800
and then the level one key leaves in

1165
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,400
both key servers because that is the one

1166
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,359
that is exchanged

1167
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,520
the level two key is the actual key that

1168
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,520
is used to authenticate next slide this

1169
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,280
so um as an example

1170
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,520
we're going to have a dns server that

1171
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,119
wants to authenticate every packet that

1172
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:39,839
receives

1173
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,960
uh from end host squaring it

1174
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,640
and then this this server is going to be

1175
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,079
trusted by the key server

1176
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,200
uh for certain protocols certain users

1177
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,119
i just called it dns it could have been

1178
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,119
dns uh source authenticated whatever is

1179
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,160
this a string that

1180
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,960
we have uh agreed upon and then uh if

1181
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,480
you go to the next slide we'll see the

1182
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,520
sequence of events

1183
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,319
that are listed over there this

1184
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,319
yesterday very quickly

1185
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,440
so we have um

1186
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,319
yeah we have just the sequence uh on as

1187
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,200
a

1188
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,520
blue uh on the left side we have the dns

1189
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,240
server

1190
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,960
that is our guide that actually requests

1191
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,960
to get the level one key to the key

1192
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,599
server

1193
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,520
because the key server has configuration

1194
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,599
saying that that end host in particular

1195
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,760
is authorized to get that key they

1196
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,119
return that key to it

1197
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,480
then on the right hand side we see uh

1198
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,119
green uh the end host at p that makes

1199
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,720
that wants actually to communicate with

1200
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,599
the dns server

1201
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:37,200
and then for that they need to get the

1202
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,280
level two key to talk to that end host

1203
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,000
in particular

1204
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,680
so they will they will ask their key

1205
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,839
server please give me that level two key

1206
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:45,680
for me because they actually cannot get

1207
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,079
it

1208
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,079
and then the key server checks if they

1209
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,400
have the level one key for that other as

1210
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,920
they do in this case we'll have another

1211
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,119
example where they don't but this one

1212
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,000
they do and they

1213
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,359
they can quickly derive the level two

1214
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,599
key which is returned to the end host

1215
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,839
then that end host from that moment on

1216
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,920
uh can start using that level two key

1217
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,599
using symmetric photography or

1218
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,240
just computing the mac for instance um

1219
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:06,720
to

1220
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,880
start creating tags for their packets

1221
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,920
which arrive at the

1222
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,720
dns server and they know that that

1223
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,520
packet came from the asb

1224
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,839
and host whatever in the host this is

1225
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,839
and so they can quickly derive the level

1226
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,119
2 key on the fly

1227
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:22,960
and they can validate that attack we'll

1228
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,480
see concrete examples uh

1229
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,400
maybe later if there is time next slide

1230
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,839
please

1231
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,440
i'm sorry i have to rush a bit because

1232
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,280
otherwise all right so this is just a

1233
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:31,839
recap

1234
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,920
for for later for the uh for the record

1235
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,000
uh what we just stopped i don't think

1236
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,599
that we have to go through everything

1237
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,240
uh the that we just said uh it's just

1238
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,920
that the key points here is the level

1239
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,599
two key is the important key that's the

1240
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:44,960
key that is used to

1241
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,400
actually authenticate uh the packets

1242
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,960
um the protocol can be locked already in

1243
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,400
level zero but if it's not

1244
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,079
locked in level two it has to be locked

1245
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,520
in level one or level two

1246
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,760
so there is always a protocol locked at

1247
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,280
the very end at the very last

1248
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,760
uh the very least sorry at level two

1249
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,480
next slide please

1250
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,920
all right so um again

1251
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,280
um let's just look at the last paragraph

1252
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,599
so

1253
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,440
the key the key uh not the key the

1254
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,599
important part is is that the level two

1255
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,480
key has to

1256
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,720
be obtained by both parts uh of the

1257
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,760
communication

1258
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,760
so there is a fast side which is the

1259
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,520
owner of the key that can derive that

1260
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,000
level two key very quickly and they

1261
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,440
don't need to do anything special they

1262
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,880
just need to know which is

1263
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,559
who is the other the other guy in the

1264
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,640
communication while the slow side which

1265
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,480
is not the owner of the key

1266
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,520
they cannot derive it very quickly so

1267
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,760
the communication so the packet flow it

1268
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,839
can go both ways from hp or

1269
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:44,079
b2a but this low side will have to get

1270
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,440
the level 2 key

1271
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,359
beforehand or if they receive a packet

1272
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,559
that they don't have it they have to

1273
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,839
kill that packet to be source

1274
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:50,880
authenticated later

1275
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,520
this is symmetry um well it's kind of

1276
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,079
important

1277
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,839
isn't it all right so if we go to next

1278
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,160
slide and then um

1279
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,119
i will just conclude with the uh with

1280
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,760
the key derivation

1281
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,079
all right so the uh the key derivation

1282
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,680
uh

1283
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,160
the two key derivation functions or

1284
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,839
flares the first one is to derive the

1285
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,599
level 0 key that's the slow one but

1286
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,200
since we only do it

1287
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,760
once per uh valid per period the key

1288
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,640
period or

1289
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,480
key validity period that's not so

1290
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,319
important we're using the password-based

1291
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,559
uh key derivation function 2 with a

1292
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,440
thousand iterations of sha 256

1293
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,520
and uh that is only that's done only

1294
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,720
once again uh

1295
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,880
and uh done only in the key server of

1296
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,760
database

1297
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,119
and then the level one and level two

1298
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:36,960
keys are using a much faster

1299
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,400
pseudorandom function is aes sc mac

1300
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,119
uh this the details are explained later

1301
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,319
also in the uh

1302
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,040
in the slides and the paper zone so the

1303
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,480
important part is like the level one

1304
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,640
level two keys as we have said already

1305
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,440
they are very very fast this is just the

1306
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,280
the last point is just the um

1307
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,800
clarification the nomenclature which

1308
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,559
sometimes could be difficult to

1309
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,599
read so that key proto x2y

1310
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,319
means that there is a dr key uh which is

1311
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,440
locking the protocol

1312
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,640
proto um and has a um

1313
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,119
fast side or owner of the key x and the

1314
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:11,920
other side is

1315
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,200
y and x and y can be a yeses or

1316
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,800
n hosts depending on whether we are

1317
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,480
talking about the level one or level two

1318
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:18,880
keys

1319
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,839
if we go to the next slide

1320
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,400
yeah um the level one keys so the as2as

1321
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,160
keys are the ones that are propagated

1322
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,200
um to the um to the other

1323
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,319
uh key servers and we'll see an example

1324
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:36,880
of the uh

1325
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,000
of the propagation of the exchange so uh

1326
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,280
since the communication has to be

1327
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,200
designed and encrypted in the case of

1328
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,640
for instance scion

1329
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,920
design architecture we're using the

1330
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,000
control plane tki in the current id

1331
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,960
internet we could use rpki for instance

1332
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,720
uh this there's configuration the key

1333
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,319
servers that could deny

1334
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,720
as we had said before up to the um to

1335
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,319
the aes granularity level

1336
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,520
uh level one key requests and that could

1337
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,520
also happen for level two uh key request

1338
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,359
within the is

1339
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,440
um if there is the possibility of

1340
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,599
locking this we have set the protocol or

1341
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,400
reading the

1342
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,960
secret value that uh that allows the

1343
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,559
fast side not to

1344
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,720
not to have prefetch the level one key

1345
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,119
for the other side as well

1346
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,240
all right so just um if we can go

1347
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,599
to the next slide please this is just

1348
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,160
my last slide all right so we have in

1349
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
the middle in blue the asa which is the

1350
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,680
key server that uh

1351
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,559
that wants to propagate or the key that

1352
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,920
wants to be

1353
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
uh uh transmitted to the other key

1354
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,240
servers so we have the first thing is in

1355
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:40,880
the

1356
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,680
key server b wants to prefetch that

1357
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,640
level one key

1358
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,280
makes a request a key server a checks it

1359
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:47,839
and then

1360
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,760
returns the key of course no problem and

1361
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,200
then uh

1362
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,000
later on the an end host in the asa

1363
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,520
wants to obtain the uh

1364
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,680
level two key as we have seen in the dns

1365
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,960
server example

1366
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,640
and then in this case the key server

1367
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,400
doesn't have the l1 key

1368
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,079
which is requested to the key server at

1369
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,839
a but the permission

1370
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:09,280
to the um as is not granted and that

1371
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,839
key server c is just uh answering there

1372
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,160
was a denial of that key

1373
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,559
and the indian host doesn't get done all

1374
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,440
right so

1375
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,480
if we have if we go to the last question

1376
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,440
sorry last last live or questions also

1377
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,800
if anyone is interested

1378
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,800
in this presentation uh the next slides

1379
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,720
we have um references and um

1380
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,920
backup slides because yeah

1381
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,960
thank you yeah uh thank you very much

1382
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,800
quan i'm just afraid because you are

1383
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,559
running over time and we'd like to

1384
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,200
have two more presentations i suggest

1385
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,280
yes so we bring the discussion to the

1386
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,079
mailing list thanks a lot spencer i'm

1387
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:57,839
getting your slice in a second

1388
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,520
okay sure

1389
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,839
this is

1390
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,400
yeah thank you i just wanted to put that

1391
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,160
quote up and then next slide please jen

1392
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,040
okay uh my computer okay here we are

1393
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:40,400
okay cool um so

1394
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,480
my my computer just did something but it

1395
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,160
stopped now it looks like

1396
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,359
um so this is what we have in the table

1397
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:47,760
one

1398
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,359
in uh the what not to do dash 18 draft

1399
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:54,880
um and we're basically saying how

1400
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,400
you know what do we what do we do with

1401
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,000
the different lessons that we've learned

1402
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,880
and two of them

1403
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,200
were not now which are this

1404
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,799
characteristic tends to turn up a

1405
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,839
minefield full of dragons

1406
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:08,720
with the rest of that caveat one is

1407
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,559
imports trusting intermediate nodes and

1408
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:11,280
one is

1409
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,839
intermediate nodes trusting endpoints

1410
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:20,720
next slide please

1411
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,400
not now i'm trying to figure out if not

1412
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,000
now is actually not ever

1413
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,640
uh so one of the things that other

1414
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,119
people have observed uh hi adrian

1415
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,920
uh penergy has been focused a lot on

1416
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,160
indian transport

1417
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,079
and the conversations i've had about

1418
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,680
that uh and this is

1419
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,680
a quote from an isg uh

1420
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,480
off-site was uh if we could send packets

1421
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,400
with no source and destination addresses

1422
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,839
we would

1423
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,079
but i observe that there are network

1424
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,240
elements and hosts that trust each other

1425
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,280
uh in addition to

1426
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,160
network elements and hosts that don't

1427
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,040
which is

1428
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,599
true of pretty much all the elements and

1429
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,880
hosts in the

1430
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,000
uh iot ops puff that

1431
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,680
happened earlier this week and uh i i

1432
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,359
i wanted to call out elliott lear's

1433
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,079
presentation there as something that was

1434
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,720
really really clear on helping me

1435
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,839
understand that

1436
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,760
and that i have observed people that

1437
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,960
want to

1438
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,720
exploit trust and i mean that in a good

1439
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,240
way it's like starting with the next

1440
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,599
presentation

1441
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,880
next slide please

1442
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,480
so my questions and this is going to be

1443
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,960
for discussion on the mailing list or

1444
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,280
for an interim which is starting to look

1445
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,760
like a better and better idea as we talk

1446
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,319
um is the my is trust always going to be

1447
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,200
a mindful

1448
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,040
field full of dragons if that's true we

1449
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,880
should write that down and say

1450
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,599
and basically tell path aware networking

1451
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:50,480
designers

1452
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,200
don't go there uh if we think it could

1453
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,119
be usable sometimes we should write that

1454
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,160
down too

1455
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,680
and think about what are the

1456
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,040
prerequisites for path aware trust

1457
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,200
i mean between the the host and the

1458
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,040
first hop nodes is

1459
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,440
an obvious case between inter immediate

1460
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,280
nodes is an obvious case

1461
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,400
uh even between networks is horrifying

1462
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,359
but i mean people people try to do these

1463
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,160
things

1464
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,119
uh and my question is you know next

1465
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,240
question is how do we

1466
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,000
avoid tripping over the lessons that

1467
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,640
we've learned if trust is usable what

1468
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,000
else needs to be true in order

1469
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,040
to achieve deployment uh this is getting

1470
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:29,599
into a

1471
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,599
meta question about are we ready to

1472
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:32,880
start on a

1473
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,920
uh penargy what to do

1474
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,240
draft which people have been asking for

1475
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,640
for for a while

1476
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,920
and uh next slide please

1477
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,440
um for example uh in some of the ones

1478
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:49,920
that i'm

1479
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,400
looking at uh right now i'm especially

1480
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:55,520
interested in these uh

1481
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,359
in these lessons learned and especially

1482
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,119
the one that is invariant

1483
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,920
uh which is basically saying we're you

1484
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,599
know this is always going to be true and

1485
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:04,240
you need to

1486
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,040
have a really good story for uh the

1487
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,839
impact on operational practices but

1488
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,599
uh that's not to say that the other

1489
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,160
lessons learned are not interesting but

1490
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,559
uh it seems you know it seems obvious to

1491
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,599
me that the

1492
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,880
lessons learned are useful uh

1493
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,960
for us to be looking at different

1494
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,000
proposals

1495
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,480
both here and as the isg said in the

1496
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,680
iatf

1497
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,759
um that's my last slide i think

1498
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,079
so uh under the mailing list right

1499
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,240
uh i am afraid yes i i know it's

1500
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,079
good i would love to hear the

1501
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,240
discussions but looks like we made a

1502
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,520
mistake by scheduling just one hour

1503
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,680
uh brian in the queue okay

1504
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,880
a suggestion that we actually try and do

1505
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,520
an interim before 111

1506
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,000
um which i think is probably not a bad

1507
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,720
idea

1508
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,440
and i'm wondering if we want to just use

1509
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,160
the next

1510
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,799
minute to um have a quick intro to the

1511
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:11,200
next

1512
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,440
talk take this discussion to the mailing

1513
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,400
list and pick it up

1514
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,400
in a couple of months in an interim

1515
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,839
works for me thank you okay

1516
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:25,200
i am getting the next presentation

1517
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,559
uh ready just a second

1518
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,680
okay sorry i am not very effective

1519
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:36,720
and 230 i am

1520
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,660
uh verification in the

1521
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,440
[Music]

1522
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,799
hair this one okay

1523
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,920
can you hear me yes

1524
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,960
we can thank you

1525
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,000
i'm stumped from china mobile i want to

1526
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,359
share this base

1527
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:01,280
cluster relationship between the

1528
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,359
endpoint and the intermediate node

1529
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:07,279
a second next page base

1530
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,079
we found two problems the first one is

1531
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,480
that if for

1532
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,880
anyone get some information from the

1533
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,760
network

1534
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,119
uh can it pass the information and

1535
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,160
the second one is if the an opponent has

1536
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,000
some

1537
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,280
some suggestion to the

1538
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,200
network can the intermediate know the

1539
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,799
cluster discussion

1540
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,680
or plus that it is from uh ready the

1541
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:36,880
other

1542
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,480
this is a to the problem

1543
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,839
uh next speech please

1544
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,359
normally we cannot assume that we can

1545
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,359
trust each other because

1546
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,280
we found the reason is that the

1547
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,680
independent work work can support this

1548
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,599
layer 4 connections and the network only

1549
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,799
supported to this layer 3

1550
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:09,359
x4 is a hardware

1551
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:14,640
a replacement relationship between them

1552
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,000
because they work in the different

1553
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
network layers next page please

1554
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,440
and uh in our of the visions

1555
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,319
we find that uh the gateway of the

1556
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:30,960
endpoint

1557
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,599
is able to maintain a connection state

1558
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,000
and

1559
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,280
transfer relationship for each user such

1560
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,559
as this png

1561
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,319
it means a broadband network of g3

1562
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,000
and we also found that

1563
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,440
the ingress ee perhaps is a main node to

1564
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,559
select a

1565
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,599
path for the flow so we think that

1566
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,880
uh if we we cannot make

1567
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,920
every intermediary order trusted

1568
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,599
perhaps we can make this png and the

1569
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,400
intermediate

1570
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,200
ingress in this ingress e trusted

1571
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,078
next speed please

1572
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,839
okay so we have a initial solution for

1573
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:20,480
this from the

1574
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,359
inverse pe to the client we can make

1575
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,200
this ingress pe

1576
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,880
insert insert some technique later

1577
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,240
for the message and

1578
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,720
from the client to the ingress pe

1579
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,160
perhaps

1580
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,359
linguistic announcement of

1581
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,960
every translator so we

1582
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,440
like this indeed make us later instead

1583
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,960
so oh we can

1584
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,400
put this traffic into a

1585
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,520
set between this png or this

1586
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,839
inverse p is

1587
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:04,480
our potential solution

1588
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,240
thank you i think that's all thank you

1589
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,280
any comments okay

1590
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,880
thank you very much and i

1591
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,359
suggest again that we bring in comments

1592
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:19,200
to the mailing clients because they are

1593
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,160
run over time

1594
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,760
and as far as i know the session could

1595
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,720
automatically shut down

1596
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,640
so thanks a lot for presenting this okay

1597
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,799
thank you very much i'd like to send

1598
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:31,760
jake taking

1599
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,280
meeting minutes and i guess

1600
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,599
and as brian mentioned we probably will

1601
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,359
do interim

1602
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,280
which here looking at this all those

1603
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,039
discussions i will have to bring to the

1604
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,720
mailing please sounds like a brilliant

1605
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,280
idea

1606
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,280
more and more with every minute yeah

1607
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,720
let's take take all of that to the list

1608
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,440
and one of the

1609
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,400
we'll um reach out sort of like the next

1610
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,000
week or the following week on starting

1611
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,440
to schedule an interim we'd want to do

1612
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,400
that between

1613
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,880
uh now in san francisco which is sort of

1614
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,480
the end of july so we'd probably be

1615
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,000
looking at like uh

1616
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,200
uh late may uh mid to late may uh

1617
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,799
june but we'll find something that works

1618
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:08,319
in the time zone that works um

1619
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,480
for uh the participants as well i know

1620
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,000
this was super late

1621
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,559
for jen and super early for everybody um

1622
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,559
on the west coast the u.s so

1623
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,960
we'll try and find a a different slot

1624
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,680
for that as well

1625
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,960
so thank you all for um um

1626
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,039
for uh your attention and thank you to

1627
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:26,000
the presenters especially

1628
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,559
for going fast and we will see you on

1629
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,200
the list and at the interim

1630
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:37,359
thank you bye thanks bye
