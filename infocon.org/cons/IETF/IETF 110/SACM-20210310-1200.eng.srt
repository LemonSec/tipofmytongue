1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
oh

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so

3
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,560
let's see um

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,200
adam we give another minute or two i was

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,759
wondering if you wanted to uh

6
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,320
check your audio as somebody that i

7
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,839
expect might be speaking

8
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,000
and anybody else who thinks they might

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
be speaking fairly regularly do you want

10
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
to check your audio

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
before we get started we'll also meet us

12
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,000
a minute taker hi karen good morning

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
good morning ramen that's true

14
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
i'm guessing that you have lots of

15
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
practice

16
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,239
good morning adam okay

17
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,920
i guess it's not morning for everybody

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,280
but uh

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,319
this is bill as well can you hear me uh

20
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,599
yes i can hear you bill great

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
all right

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,080
i guess it is day three of the meeting

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
so maybe i don't need to be quite as

24
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
worried about people's tools working

25
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,200
correctly

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,238
as anticipated

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,840
all right um

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,680
all right so at 703 we'll go ahead and

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,400
get started um

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,959
i think

31
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,599
there's only um or two people i was

32
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,040
thought might be here that i don't see

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,400
at the moment so we'll go ahead and get

34
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,760
going

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,159
uh good morning afternoon good evening

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,120
all ietf activities are covered by this

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,879

and procedures

49
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,159
the agenda that we have for today is

50
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
here so the first thing i mentioned in

51
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
in the quick warm-up was we were going

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,519
to need a minute taker

53
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,720
do we have a minute taker um

54
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,680
note taker

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,919
i'm sorry could you repeat that

56
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,080
this is bill i can take notes fantastic

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
um there is the

58
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,919
committee tool if you want to use that

59
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,320
as well

60
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
or you can take them separately as a

61
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
notetaker you can choose your poison

62
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,759
um so that's the

63
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,040
minutes the

64
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,280
agenda is below it's a pretty short

65
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
agenda in hindsight

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
um i'm not sure why i requested two

67
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,080
hours

68
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,479
um it's possible that it's because that

69
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,199
little

70
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,960
reload everything from the last meeting

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,320
is just a tiny bit too convenient

72
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,039
um so apologies to the scheduling

73
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,360
folks we are probably not going to need

74
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
two hours

75
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
um

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,759
so uh first up on the agenda is

77
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,919
uh coastwood uh

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,720
there you will have seen a bunch of

79
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
github traffic

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,520
on this um

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,600
uh and so as i

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,720
kind of suspected um hank would you like

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
to talk to what the current status of

84
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
the coast would document is

85
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,440
yeah hi this is saying actually i would

86
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,000
like to do that um

87
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
um my my dear cole

88
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
editor dave waltermeier is uh also

89
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
dearly missing right now

90
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,080
so um i will i will jump in here and

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
improvise

92
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,840
if that is fine also i do not mind that

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,919
we have scheduled two hours

94
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,319
because we could go and run through all

95
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,360
the uh

96
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
restated and re-qualified issues from

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,479
roman

98
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,800
i don't know in what order we're going

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
to do that i can give a concise

100
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,720
overview of the status right now we can

101
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
do it afterwards

102
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,240
or we can do it now what's your

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
preference

104
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,360
um

105
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
well i mean i think it's it's uh dave

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,919
waltermire was the one person that was

107
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,960
one of the people i was

108
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
was was looking for

109
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,919
um so maybe we will do the meeting part

110
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,319
first

111
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,000
and then we will go back through and go

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,919
through the uh the issues if that's okay

113
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,479
with you

114
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
uh a little bit more time to

115
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
get dave here um

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
the only thing is and i i probably

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
should have reached out to them

118
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
individually was i was looking for dave

119
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
i was also looking for kathleen because

120
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
of her architecture comments

121
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,520
so we'll do that at the end of the

122
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
meeting um

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
so then

124
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,160
i can give this short summary uh about

125
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
what we're doing so a store summary

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,280
would be fantastic thank you

127
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,520
thank you so um again this is hank hi

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
everybody one of the

129
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
editors of the uh course with id um

130
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
yeah as karen highlighted there was a

131
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,680
lot of traffic on the

132
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,960
github tracker due to our uh

133
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
attempts to address romans and

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,400
kathleen's last

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,759
latest input um there there are some

136
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,520
logistical steps to open

137
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,599
uh they are basically all ayana or

138
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,879
registry based

139
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
uh like media types and such so so

140
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
that's on dave's plate i can't give

141
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,400
updates on that today

142
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,440
um skimming the list of reiterated

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,720
open issues from roman i assume uh there

144
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,440
by by

145
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,199
just reading that list that uh i think

146
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,000
like 90 of that is covered

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,039
and actually has is addressed in in some

148
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,000
text or

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,039
has been deemed uh basically not

150
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,120
applicable it's only a few cases

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,919
um so we can run through these later and

152
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,720
our uh

153
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,039
estimate is that uh yeah this is uh

154
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
unfortunate a little bit slow

155
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,000
i would like to see this a little faster

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,319
but

157
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,840
we are at the end of the tunnel here

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
there's not only light at the end of the

159
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,479
tunnel but we are at the end of the

160
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,199
tunnel

161
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
so i think this is the last round we

162
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,399
need to do to

163
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,919
ship this and uh yeah details upcoming i

164
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,399
might

165
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,399
want to have a small report here on this

166
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,680
front um we are preparing right the

167
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,160
moment

168
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,519
work in the uh rats working group that

169
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,480
will make use

170
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
of a coal switch and create a

171
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,800
rim wrapper around that and we have a

172
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
complement to code switch

173
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,120
we currently call commit the concise

174
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,640
module identifier

175
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,880
for the hardware components that

176
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,440
software resides on to identify these

177
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
and that can be composed of composite

178
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,680
devices of various complexity

179
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,440
and also addresses the problem so to

180
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,000
speak

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,920
of firmware that does not reside in a

182
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,040
file system

183
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
just as a reminder goes with or switz in

184
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,480
general

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,279
are based on rely on file system

186
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,480
existence

187
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,360
um firmware sometimes does not bring its

188
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,240
own file

189
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,279
file system some do but then again

190
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,640
there's a firmware in the

191
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,959
ranges of hundreds of megabytes smaller

192
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,640
firmware typically doesn't

193
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
and so it is uh feasible to

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,959
cover uh reference values and hashes and

195
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,240
data about that

196
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
in in on the hardware side because it's

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
about the firm things here

198
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
so um so that is upcoming just as a

199
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,120
highlight and

200
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,000
that also was a one of the implementers

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,560
here

202
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,279
um consumed codes with and therefore

203
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
created new running code

204
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
which is very helpful there are three

205
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
implementations now

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
out there that two of them freely

207
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,519
available

208
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600
one of them is used internally with red

209
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,959
hat

210
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,920
that exists and provided feedback in the

211
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
course of this

212
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,959
relatively long working group bus call

213
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,720
so that's my report on

214
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
this front and yes i talked a little bit

215
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,480
okay hey hank can you comment on

216
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,760
lawrence's github issue

217
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
yeah we addressed his issue actually to

218
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,160
some extent and then he

219
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
stated more so what we

220
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
did is we provided a single

221
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,000
uh a single rule in cdda

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
that is the root rule now that covers

223
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,279
all

224
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,279
combinations of tagging signing

225
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,680
uh tags we have two corresponding

226
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
sections in the id one of them

227
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,160
is appropriately called uh text

228
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
co-switch and the other one is signed

229
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,800
code switch

230
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,360
there we also made a very early on

231
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,279
statement here that

232
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,760
um sebor tags are not software tags

233
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,640
so software tag is a software switz

234
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,199
effect switch

235
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,640
a term attack term originating from the

236
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
switch and iso domain

237
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,360
and sibo tags is attack term

238
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,279
uh originating from of course the sibo

239
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,959
wg here in itf

240
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,959
so these are not the same tags and we

241
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,880
disambiguate them early on in the

242
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,480
section that is called tagged

243
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
code switch and uh we also play with

244
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,519
redundancy to make it very clear

245
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
uh that tagged codes with tags uh this

246
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,480
name includes two tag types

247
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
that is unfortunate but it can't be

248
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
avoided uh we have to live with this

249
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,600
terminology it's not from us we do not

250
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,279
make that choices that are not

251
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,360
conflicting here but we can disambiguate

252
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,760
them

253
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,720
so um having said that uh you can for

254
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,440
example

255
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,639
tag the outer structure of a signed

256
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,639
co-switch in this case you are tagging a

257
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,079
prefix and everything with the sibo

258
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,399
attack in front of the cosy tag of the

259
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,959
cosy envelope in which a coaster then

260
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,279
resides and due to the signing via cosy

261
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,880
um that's the thing you can emit the

262
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,480
attack you can have it redundantly you

263
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,880
can

264
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,120
add the code uh coast with sibo tag

265
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
outside

266
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
uh of the cozy envelope and then again

267
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
inside in front of the actual code

268
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,800
switch with the

269
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
redundant tagging we allow from that

270
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
that's not super cool

271
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
but sometimes we have these policies and

272
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,000
companies that say

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,639
we never touch a switch we keep it

274
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,360
pristine

275
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
and we have the policies that say that

276
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,560
has to be

277
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,519
uh unmodified and then you can't strip

278
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,560
attack

279
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,440
from that when you sign it if it's an

280
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
unsigned tag and so you can leave it

281
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,079
there now

282
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,160
and just edit again on the outside so

283
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,760
have this tagged device

284
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
so all these combinations of sign and

285
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,880
taking and all covered

286
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,000
with new cdl that is also mandatory uh

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,440
there was a comment about

288
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,959
how does this really work why is this in

289
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,959
the appendix and we're like okay

290
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,120
then it is a normative change we move

291
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,200
that up into the document that's the end

292
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
of the body here

293
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
and uh basically add cdda that's also

294
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,560
normative reflecting the normative

295
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,000
language

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,720
and tell people how this is done so for

297
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,160
signing and tagging

298
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,880
um then after doing all this and having

299
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,079
this one type

300
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,279
for uh the each claims that uh uh

301
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,040
lawrence want to use codes within

302
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,320
because

303
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
lauren said yeah but you don't need an

304
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,920
outside tag i don't i don't want that

305
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,519
i was like yeah that's fine that you

306
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,360
don't want that some people might so the

307
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,279
option not having it on the outside

308
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,240
is there so uh it is it is is it

309
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,600
possible to uh

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
to include that in a way that lawrence

311
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,720
wants

312
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
but uh it is also possible in theory to

313
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,279
include it now and eat in a way that

314
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,600
lawrence does not prefer i would say

315
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,040
having a tagged sibo attacked coast with

316
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,279
in

317
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,360
a semantically well-defined claim is

318
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
again some redundancy

319
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,880
if the claim label tells you this is a

320
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,000
code switch you

321
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,720
factually do not have to tag the sibo

322
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
item with a sibo attack that is saying

323
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,839
this is a go sweat

324
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
but i think again due to supply chain

325
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,320
uh procedures there might be instances

326
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,760
where this cannot be avoided

327
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
due to having things pristine and policy

328
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
is telling you you may not touch this

329
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
uh i think that's fringe cases in

330
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,839
general that should be possible

331
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
and i hope i have not have not talked

332
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,279
with lawrence about that and i don't

333
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
think he's here no he isn't

334
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,560
so uh so that is a thing that we have to

335
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
align on still but i am relatively

336
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,480
confident that we are like uh

337
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,000
99.5 to the text that lawrence wants

338
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,920
so so that that's i think covered

339
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
okay all right

340
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,639
uh that sounds good um

341
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,639
so at this stage i mean you said earlier

342
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,279
that

343
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,040
uh we had a few remaining open issues

344
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
uh milestone-wise do you have a rough

345
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:02,880
estimate of

346
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
of how long you think it'll take to get

347
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,160
through those or is it

348
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,959
kind of depend on the issues

349
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,199
um yeah it's a little bit uh

350
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,320
i think my my fellow co-editor uh

351
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
um i think getting us on this in the

352
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,320
same meeting is the biggest challenge

353
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,920
actually it's not the content

354
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,120
um so we uh um as there was a cut off

355
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
uh this just kind of was pressing and we

356
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,959
managed that

357
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,320
um unfortunately now uh as the cutoff is

358
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,800
passed

359
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
behind us um it is relatively hard to

360
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,160
find a coherent session at the moment

361
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,880
that is on

362
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
us that is not the problem of the issues

363
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,920
and that's not the problem of this

364
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,639
working group

365
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,560
that is our we are the reasons for this

366
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
unfortunately um

367
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,399
having said that i still think there are

368
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,759
only the logistic

369
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,079
issues of registry and maybe a few of

370
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,360
romans are still open

371
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,720
so my uh guesstimate would be if

372
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,959
we get a meeting done or two meetings we

373
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,920
have we're done

374
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
this should be done in two or two

375
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,279
one-hour meetings so uh

376
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,839
so i that that's my my premise here for

377
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,360
guesstimate off

378
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
and off april yeah and we are that bad

379
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,040
at meeting

380
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,279
okay so um you don't see too much work

381
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,240
left

382
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
it's just a scheduling issue yeah it's a

383
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,000
scheduled issue it's nothing yeah

384
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,279
it's okay sorry oh

385
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,560
all right great um

386
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,040
so with that uh during this room

387
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,800
yeah so to clarify a scheduling issue

388
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,240
means next month so

389
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,279
we're done by april yeah i thought we're

390
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,399
done at the end of

391
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
april yeah i think we need six weeks

392
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,120
to do two hours that is my uh

393
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
my new uh from speaking from life

394
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,800
experience my new guestimate here

395
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,079
okay thanks all right thank you very

396
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,040
much

397
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,799
and again i would like to sorry to

398
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,720
interrupt and again i would like to

399
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,199
run through the open items with roman to

400
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,799
clarify some of these because i think

401
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,640
roman did not find them intuitively

402
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,120
addressed

403
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
if that's fine with the group um

404
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
yeah that's fine so i i haven't modified

405
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,319
the agenda that i'm showing but

406
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,599
basically we're going to go through this

407
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,039
agenda and then at the end of it we'll

408
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,000
go

409
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,480
after the way ahead uh the any other

410
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
business will be

411
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
working stepping through the issues if

412
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,440
that's okay with you that's absolutely

413
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,559
fine with me thank you a lot

414
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,039
um okay

415
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,120
so uh

416
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,240
next up is the uh sakam architecture

417
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,440
document

418
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,880
uh adam and bill are both here i believe

419
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,840
bill you're going to lead the

420
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,960
conversation is that correct

421
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,200
i i guess i could kick this off with

422
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
there's been no update to the document

423
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
and uh the last email traffic on this

424
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,880
was but you can stay

425
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,919
speaking bill there's no update to the

426
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,559
document

427
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,879
and um uh

428
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,799
and kathleen sent comments about six

429
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,640
weeks ago but we haven't uh i mean

430
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,000
i haven't seen any response to those so

431
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,880
i'm not sure if you all have been

432
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
discussing them in the background so

433
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,760
with that

434
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,840
architecture update please

435
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,000
uh that's that's pretty much the update

436
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
uh i can uh defer to adam as well

437
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
on on anything further uh going on there

438
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,120
but uh like you said um the last real

439
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,240
activity

440
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,080
uh was in fact um kathleen's comments

441
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,200
uh on that so uh i think it kind of

442
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
rolls into

443
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
some of the the way ahead and pieces of

444
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,080
that uh

445
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,960
and you know getting getting people's

446
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,880
opinion and feedback on

447
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,240
where they want to go okay hopefully see

448
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,440
what adam has to say as well

449
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,600
hey good morning um yeah i think i

450
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,679
i think bill might you might be being a

451
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,760
little bashful but um

452
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,160
he is also working on um an

453
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
implementation of the ecosystem

454
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,200
it's not exactly from what i understand

455
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,720
like uh to the letter of

456
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,440
what the draft is today like i think in

457
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,280
implementing bill you may have learned a

458
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,120
few things that might

459
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,320
find their way into the draft um but

460
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,880
really

461
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,720
yeah at this point we

462
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,880
have the draft in its current state we

463
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,840
have a

464
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,880
a i guess a nominal implementation like

465
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,000
very basic

466
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,960
we want to see this working type of

467
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,000
implementation

468
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,320
not anything that's deployable or you

469
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,120
know product ready or anything like that

470
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,799
um but mostly i what i'd like to see is

471
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,400
you know additional feedback i know we

472
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,080
got excellent feedback from

473
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,159
from both roman and kathleen um

474
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,000
yeah i think that's basically where we

475
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
are bill if i mischaracterize the

476
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,679
implementation that you're working on i

477
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,240
apologize

478
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
hey bill can you take a moment to talk

479
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
about the

480
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,919
the implementation yeah i can do that

481
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,480
um honestly the uh that that's what i

482
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,760
was just gonna talk about

483
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,840
was the fact that um the

484
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,880
what what i've done is uh basically the

485
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,000
product of

486
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,919
uh kind of my own personal hackathon in

487
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,240
the past uh two and a half days

488
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
um so uh but uh

489
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,760
i have a bit of what i'd like to call a

490
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,039
few of the components

491
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,400
uh working yeah and and working

492
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,440
i'll say loosely um it's a

493
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,840
uh basically a management and

494
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,880
orchestration

495
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,600
component that can

496
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,840
basically interface with a collection

497
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,799
component to

498
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,880
perform some hard-coded collections

499
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,240
using s-cap related content it's just

500
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,960
some basic

501
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,159
uh some very very very simple uh

502
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,200
oval instructions um and

503
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,840
that collection has hooked into the tool

504
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
that we happen to have here at cis

505
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,280
uh amazingly enough and uh

506
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,960
it uh but it can uh send messages

507
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,320
to ensure that uh different components

508
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,720
are

509
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,000
awake um if anybody's looked at the

510
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
draft there's a

511
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,440
an operation in there called the

512
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,000
heartbeat and so that's basically just

513
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,520
sending a ping message to each of the

514
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,440
components it does that

515
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,320
um i can onboard a couple of the

516
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,679
components like the orchestration

517
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,760
uh collection components so those

518
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,840
messages that message exchange

519
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,600
and um a small amount of

520
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,559
capability uh information can be

521
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,000
exchanged

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,840
and then basically publishing the

523
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,200
collection instructions to

524
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,520
uh to to have that collector perform

525
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,799
collection i had that's

526
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
uh as far as i got i haven't gotten back

527
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,320
to any sort of

528
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,400
persisting any of the collected posture

529
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
attributes to

530
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,520
any sort of repository

531
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,520
like i said two days

532
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,400
and did is there a message framework

533
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,280
you built on top of uh i'm using the

534
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,760
opendxl

535
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,360
this is a kind of a an open source kind

536
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,080
of

537
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,840
layer on top of mqtt

538
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,760
oh roman's in queue yeah sorry i

539
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,039
i guess we don't have enough people that

540
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,039
we really need to worry about this so

541
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,440
bill can help me understand i get the

542
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,039
implementation you did relative to the

543
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,320
text of the architecture

544
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,799
but what sam technologies are you using

545
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:37,600
to instantiate that architecture

546
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,080
uh all right so i'm gonna jump in for

547
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,960
bill for

548
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
anomaly up so what do you mean by that

549
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,159
roman

550
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,919
yeah so so that this is a little bit of

551
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,279
a guess the lar i mean i'm thrilled we

552
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,960
have an implementation because

553
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,520
it makes the architecture real what i'm

554
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
trying to get my

555
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,159
head wrapped around is

556
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
you know what what is kind of the

557
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,679
architecture really codifying

558
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,000
and are there technologies we're

559
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,360
developing

560
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,600
that and that we feel we need to

561
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,400
standardize as part of this process so

562
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,960
long term i mean what there were a bunch

563
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,480
of questions about you know we got some

564
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,840
reviews on the architecture

565
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
what's unclear to me is how will we know

566
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,360
we're done with the architecture

567
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,159
document

568
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,279
what more needs to get done and

569
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,559
is there additional work that is related

570
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,320
to actual protocols and standards that

571
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,679
we need to develop as part of that

572
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,240
architecture

573
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,799
i mean so is the architecture a sack of

574
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,720
architecture or is it a series of in my

575
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,400
head like operational practices about

576
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,080
how to compose existing tech

577
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,440
um yeah that's a good question it's

578
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
really

579
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,159
what were i think the the the sacchamine

580
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,720
things that are about it are kind of

581
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,240
dealing with the

582
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,120
the roles and and the interfaces and and

583
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,240
kind of the

584
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,480
the different message structures that go

585
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,279
that are

586
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,880
transported back and forth between

587
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,960
components but i think

588
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
implementation of each of the components

589
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
is

590
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
however folks would like to do it it's

591
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,080
uh just a matter of

592
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,039
uh the the different types of uh

593
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:13,679
messages

594
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,200
over whatever um you know kind of

595
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,080
operational interface uh that's being

596
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,279
defined in the draft

597
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,159
and that's kind of whatever the taxonomy

598
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,400
or

599
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,799
ontology section or whatever i think

600
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,799
it's labeled taxonomy

601
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,120
um so that sort of defines the different

602
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,320
topics

603
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,520
um that are uh

604
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,760
communicated over uh the things that are

605
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,559
you know

606
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,480
where things get published or subscribed

607
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
to or uh the different

608
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,600
sort of directed message topics that

609
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
that

610
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,400
are made available as well so that

611
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,600
that's really what

612
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,360
i guess that's the most sacchamine

613
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,120
portion of it

614
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,880
so bill can can i can i just clarify

615
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
if i heard that correctly i mean so the

616
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,600
the sac of me portion is really the

617
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,320
the message formats for like

618
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,520
orchestration and

619
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,639
and capability yes

620
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,760
yes

621
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,360
does that answer the question roman

622
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,080
i i guess i may have a different mental

623
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,720
model

624
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
than others but you know i look at what

625
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
the sack and working group has actually

626
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,520
published

627
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,039
and or is in flight we have co-suid

628
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,960
we have a an aposter enterprise use case

629
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,400
we have requirements

630
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,279
and we have software inventory messaging

631
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:49,600
so

632
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,080
when we say we're doing sacchamine

633
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,120
things

634
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,600
and we're rolling that in i i guess i

635
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,880
don't see where the

636
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
working group developed technology is

637
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,559
being inserted here

638
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,400
i can see that we're talking about apis

639
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
but we're inventing the whole cloth in

640
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,679
this document it seems

641
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,279
and so i'm just trying to get a sense of

642
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,520
whether this this architecture document

643
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,559
is tipping or hinting that there is new

644
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,080
standards work to be done

645
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,960
or what we're trying to do is develop a

646
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,600
self

647
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,559
just a self-contained document and

648
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,919
that's going to be the end of it

649
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,440
and this is again just tipping my hand i

650
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
mean i'm trying to understand what the

651
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,520
way ahead is

652
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,799
and i'm trying to understand whether

653
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,799
this is an architecture that's defining

654
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,840
more work that we need to do or or if

655
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
it's not that we're

656
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,880
how do we get to closure i mean how do

657
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:49,840
we know this document is done

658
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,919
i guess i'll just talk yeah okay so um

659
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,440
sorry i tried to raise hands and all

660
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,760
that

661
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,600
um roman that's a really good question

662
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,720
so i mean

663
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,320
and and this might be a discussion for

664
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,840
the way ahead as well so

665
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,760
in in my mind right now the architecture

666
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
drafted as bill was

667
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,679
mentioning chris bill chris were

668
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,440
mentioning um

669
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,480
it defines components roles the

670
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
interfaces

671
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,240
um and right now like in the in the

672
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
notional implementation that bill's been

673
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
working on we're using

674
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,440
essentially s-cap information you know

675
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,960
messages to go back and forth like

676
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,360
that's

677
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,120
that's the payload if you will between

678
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,279
all these different components

679
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,640
um when sacrum first started we had the

680
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,440
idea of

681
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,080
evolving

682
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,440
those that portion of um

683
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
i guess this architecture in a sense so

684
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
we had the idea of you know

685
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,039
bringing in a way to model assets

686
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,279
a way to improve on fccdf

687
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,520
possibility the way to improve oval

688
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
i think back in the day oval was even

689
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,480
submitted to the working group

690
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,520
as a way for mitre to kind of

691
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,360
say it's you know to kind of bless the

692
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,799
effort i guess

693
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,440
um so to answer your question really i

694
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,520
think requires additional discussion

695
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,720
we could leave the architecture the way

696
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,600
it is

697
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,120
and just to find um

698
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,440
the interfaces and sorry hank i know

699
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,799
you're probably cringing at all the

700
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,880
different terms that i'm using

701
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,240
um and then make the

702
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,480
message payloads that go back and forth

703
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
kind of like

704
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,840
more extensible in a sense so it could

705
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,159
handle s-cap it could handle other types

706
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,720
of messages

707
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,760
or we could do that and

708
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,279
move beyond that and try to i don't want

709
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,559
to say reinvent

710
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,559
but you know create the checklist format

711
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
create a better oval if you will

712
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,279
things of that nature like we tried to

713
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
do this information model back in the

714
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,399
day that was massive

715
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,000
like i don't think we need that but

716
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,399
anyway that's my thinking on it so i

717
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,640
don't know if that helps characterize

718
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,440
what what it is you're after but maybe

719
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,120
it does yeah i mean

720
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,159
now hearing that that that's helpful so

721
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,919
maybe i didn't hear it when bill was

722
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,840
saying it so kind of sorry bill

723
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,559
that you're defining roles and

724
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,000
responsibilities it's

725
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,279
an a an api kind of of sorts

726
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,799
we there's a decision point here about

727
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,840
whether there's working group

728
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,320
specificity but the contribution of the

729
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
of the implementation that bill was

730
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
talking about correct me if i have it

731
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,600
wrong

732
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,080
is that utop took the roles in this

733
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,840
document as they were kind of defined

734
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
and found a series of kind of

735
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
technologies that were that is able to

736
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,279
kind of demonstrate a manifestation of

737
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,080
said architecture

738
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
fair

739
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,360
i think so yes

740
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,399
okay thanks

741
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,799
i guess the last um if i if i may like

742
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:21,760
the last point

743
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,360
that uh i'd like to kind of share and it

744
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,720
kind of goes

745
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,360
along a little bit of you know what adam

746
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,480
was kind of talking about

747
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,360
about more extensible message payloads

748
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:33,679
and

749
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,360
and things of that nature like the um

750
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,320
you know some of the stuff that i kind

751
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,640
of

752
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,760
discovered in this while i was kind of

753
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,320
trying to put something together was

754
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,440
um in the the kind of capability

755
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,559
discovery or

756
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,559
capability advertisement between the

757
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,919
different components like

758
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,360
uh a certain piece could say you know

759
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,480
defines you know like i speak oval or i

760
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,559
i understand coast with and things of

761
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,799
that nature and i think that those

762
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,760
uh one of some you know some or many of

763
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
those things could be defined

764
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,480
um in in the draft as well to kind of

765
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:12,960
help

766
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,080
illustrate the different uh

767
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,399
i'll call it languages that components

768
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,879
can speak

769
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,039
so that was also something that was

770
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,960
helping to like

771
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,519
it was giving me information as i was

772
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,640
hacking some things together

773
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,360
yeah i mean what you're what you're kind

774
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,799
of saying makes makes kind of total

775
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,519
sense to me

776
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,279
kind of bill about how they could

777
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,200
suggest future work uh i guess

778
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,320
i'm coming from the perspective of who

779
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,039
would do

780
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,600
that work and i'm not gonna we can save

781
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
that for the way ahead because

782
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,039
i'm a little skeptical that we have the

783
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,120
bandwidth to pick that work up

784
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
sure

785
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,360
in some ways i'd say it could apply to

786
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,000
you know any

787
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
group that needs to i guess transport

788
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,279
specific message payloads to

789
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,960
other components within the ecosystem

790
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,840
you use big word

791
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,600
uh others have a sense of what the next

792
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,880
step would be

793
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,040
what is that a question that we should

794
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,440
do it way ahead roman or

795
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:21,839
do you want to do that now

796
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
bill do you have something for that uh

797
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,679
i'm sorry i was uh

798
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,879
doing some notes so i i'm i'm

799
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,839
repeat the question i'm sorry

800
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,800
go ahead kathleen sorry yeah my my

801
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,000
question was i'm just trying to

802
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
understand what the next step is and

803
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,839
how will we as a working group know

804
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,359
we're ready to go to last

805
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,319
call for example

806
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,879
yeah i guess roman i was saying that

807
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,639
maybe we should do that in the way ahead

808
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,079
conversation

809
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,160
do you want to talk about it with just

810
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,440
regards to this or do you want to talk

811
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,240
about it with

812
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,079
lay ahead talk about it with way ahead i

813
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,520
was just repeating the question since

814
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,119
bill was building ketchup

815
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,280
okay sorry kathleen and

816
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,280
i am sorry i just moved my headset so

817
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,720
you might hear a spinny toy in the

818
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,000
background

819
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
um so i i think what adam and bill

820
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,400
are saying and and we um

821
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,839
i think what adam and bill are saying

822
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,920
makes sense and

823
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,160
you know just in terms of how do we do

824
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,680
posture assessment how do we do the

825
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,480
things

826
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,680
sakham sets out to do um

827
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,040
you know backing it up with the

828
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,720
implementation is very good uh

829
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,480
and then yesterday i had presented in

830
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,160
rats it might be interesting

831
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,599
to um and that would expand this

832
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,760
so it may make it take longer but it

833
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,520
might be interesting to also include the

834
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,880
intersection

835
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,960
of other types of work to ease posture

836
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,880
assessment and just

837
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,960
advance this but that would make it

838
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,280
bigger and take longer so i don't know

839
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
if there's tolerance for that

840
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,240
putting it down as a note but i'm gonna

841
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,800
table the conversation till

842
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,359
after we when we get to the way ahead

843
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,649
[Music]

844
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
cathy

845
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,599
any other questions on architecture that

846
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,119
aren't

847
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,359
oh yeah i was talking about nobody

848
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,598
i apparently muted myself so um

849
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,240
i'm not sure what anybody has heard that

850
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,839
i just said but anyway that's beside the

851
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:04,880
point

852
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,960
uh so we have status on coast we have

853
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,920
status on saccum we have um

854
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
and then the next document is on the

855
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,520
agenda because it is

856
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,839
it is a document we have been working on

857
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,359
but there have been no updates and it's

858
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,320
expired

859
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,040
and i wanted it on here to sort of

860
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,560
complete the

861
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,040
uh status review before we moved away

862
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
ahead so

863
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,960
uh does anybody want to say anything any

864
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,920
of the authors want to say anything

865
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,640
about the

866
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,839
roley configuration checklist extension

867
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,480
this is bill um there there hasn't been

868
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,760
a lot of work on that

869
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,040
probably since early december um

870
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,960
they we had uh stephen banghart and

871
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,400
uh gabe alford from red hat and i had

872
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,119
uh kind of regularly scheduled meetings

873
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,000
for a little while

874
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,359
um you know i'd say

875
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,560
since the the previous uh

876
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,079
previous ietf um

877
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,200
and that was moving along nicely i feel

878
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,000
like and

879
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,240
part of it was focused on the draft and

880
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,760
getting it ready and part of it was

881
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,880
focused on

882
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,240
i think red hat trying to do an

883
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,359
implementation of it

884
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,839
um you know at the same time of rolly in

885
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,880
general

886
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,160
um but uh then

887
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,400
gabe alford left red hat and it pretty

888
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,240
much stopped after the

889
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,759
the work pretty much stopped after that

890
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,599
that that's been the last update was

891
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,839
probably early december

892
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,280
okay um so

893
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,520
i could yeah if i could ask kind of a

894
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,720
question so

895
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,560
you know this is something we have a

896
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,000
milestone for

897
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,480
we have an expired draft and we don't

898
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,119
even have an

899
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,680
adopted working group document you know

900
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,839
do we really have the energy to do this

901
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,240
work

902
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,520
because i ask in august we did a call

903
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,720
for adoption

904
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,119
and we you know we did not have enough

905
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,599
energy to even adopt this document

906
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,160
so i'm a little kind of confused maybe i

907
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,599
missed the interim which is i know we

908
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,119
talked about at the interim but what are

909
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,000
the facts that have changed

910
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,680
on the ground in august we couldn't even

911
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,760
get enough folks to

912
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,680
to to marshall up enough support to

913
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,040
adopt this so

914
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,079
what's the thinking here

915
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,520
uh i think that this is really on on me

916
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,359
more so than the authors it was it was

917
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,680
basically i wanted all of the documents

918
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,520
on here that we had any progress on

919
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,880
before i moved to the

920
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,800
review of milestones and the way ahead

921
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,760
discussion because that

922
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,520
tease up the conversation the way i

923
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,200
organized it

924
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,160
okay perfect thank you

925
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,960
okay um

926
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,119
so now that we've gone through the three

927
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,119
documents that we're currently

928
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,680
making summer some progress on or that

929
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,920
we've at least had contributions on

930
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,720
um i'm going to go to the way ahead and

931
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,319
i wanted to preface this a little bit

932
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:06,800
with

933
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,000
um this is all just my

934
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,520
opinion and uh chris and i had a

935
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,000
a really quick conversation about this

936
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,119
uh so

937
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,400
uh and roman

938
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,319
had sent an email a little while back

939
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,480
that oh

940
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,079
i didn't um i didn't really think all

941
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,599
the way through until i started trying

942
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,720
to write slides on this

943
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,000
so our current milestones this is what's

944
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,440
currently listed

945
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,920
um and i went through all of these and

946
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,079
this explains how i constructed

947
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,920
the agenda uh and this is

948
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,880
where we are with these milestones um

949
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,160
the ones that i marked through are

950
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,800
things that

951
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,760
so you know to sort of refresh our

952
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,119
memory if

953
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,400
i guess it's now maybe it must have been

954
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,560
like the 2017 time frame we did a

955
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,319
rechartering and in that rechartering

956
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,680
we're like okay we need to have really

957
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,119
concrete milestones that we can make

958
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,400
progress on

959
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,000
and these were the milestones that we

960
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,599
published and clearly we're not updating

961
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,280
the dates on them

962
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,520
um a couple of these items we haven't

963
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,560
gotten any

964
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,240
uh input on at all and that is the

965
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,760
two that i have marked out um

966
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,800
the roley document we have

967
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,200
as roman has already indicated we have

968
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,960
no adopted working group document on

969
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,079
this yet

970
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,720
um the

971
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,760
uh i i actually marked the software

972
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,800
descriptor as

973
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,000
as uh i think i marked that one wrong

974
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,760
because i think that one is

975
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,720
was decided to be set i've actually

976
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,079
confused the status of software

977
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,680
descriptor and configuration checklist

978
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,960
this is what happens when you do slides

979
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,160
late at night

980
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,839
um architecture as we've already

981
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,480
discussed was last updated in september

982
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,599
uh and coastwood was has been

983
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,800
submitted to the isg

984
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,760
uh and it is slowly making progress uh

985
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,280
and we've talked about that

986
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,839
so our milestones look pretty bleak uh

987
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:08,960
in addition to that

988
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,079
our mailing list is is

989
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,520
pretty much uh there's been no activity

990
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,040
since the last meeting except a whole

991
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,079
bunch of

992
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,920
uh github activity on the coastwood

993
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,760
document and kathleen's review

994
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,640
of architecture so basically what are we

995
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,520
doing here

996
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,560
um so this is my list of next steps that

997
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,270
we could take um

998
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,200
[Music]

999
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,680
and again this is my opinion uh

1000
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,560
as uh teased out of conversations with

1001
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:40,960
uh

1002
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,680
chris and roman but doesn't was not

1003
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,960
reviewed with them so

1004
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,240
i get all the blame uh proposal a drop

1005
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,440
all the milestones which aren't co

1006
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,119
sweater architecture

1007
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,440
uh see if we can get some realistic

1008
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,720
milestones on the table for the

1009
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,760
architecture

1010
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
and then add a milestone about closing

1011
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,800
or rechartering

1012
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,920
um by the end of this year um i do

1013
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,359
believe like

1014
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,960
i didn't look up the exact date but it

1015
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,400
seems to me like six months or a year

1016
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,680
ago we were like

1017
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,760
uh we're going to keep the working group

1018
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,359
around for another six months to see if

1019
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,760
we can get to the end of our work

1020
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,480
or get some energy and we're basically

1021
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,640
rehabbing that conversation

1022
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,000
um proposal b so basically it's a

1023
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,200
proposal a was a

1024
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,319
recharger proposal b was to uh to finish

1025
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,680
coast wood and pause the working group

1026
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,880
for a year to see

1027
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,119
if contributions and maturity is

1028
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,319
forthcoming especially in the

1029
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:35,520
architecture space

1030
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,280
or a proposal c that i haven't thought

1031
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,839
of um

1032
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,319
so that was

1033
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,560
um

1034
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,920
where we are with that so um comments

1035
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,800
questions

1036
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,630
what do people think we need to be doing

1037
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,769
[Music]

1038
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
wow

1039
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,920
sorry i know it seems like nobody's

1040
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,440
talking i think i'm just taking some

1041
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:23,520
time to digest a little bit

1042
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,599
sorry this is adam i i guess we're

1043
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,720
supposed to say that right

1044
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,160
i'll give you a break in that of what

1045
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,400
it's it's almost 7 00 a.m

1046
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,520
right adam yeah

1047
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,000
exactly

1048
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,359
exactly hi yes i can't find the hand

1049
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:44,160
raised tool

1050
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,440
i don't know what i'm doing wrong oh

1051
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,680
there it is right next to the new audio

1052
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,440
jessica wake up all right

1053
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,839
um

1054
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,119
i'm kind of leaning a little bit towards

1055
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,040
proposal a

1056
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,440
um i think it would be interesting to me

1057
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,480
to see

1058
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,920
the architecture mature more i think

1059
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,800
with the

1060
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,160
attestation proposal and rats and with

1061
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,800
some

1062
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,680
related work we have going on in oca in

1063
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,760
terms of the saccum or the s-cap

1064
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
architecture

1065
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,280
i think there might still be goodness to

1066
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,960
the architecture i'd like to

1067
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,240
to let it carry on if the authors are

1068
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,920
still interested and if they still have

1069
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,040
bandwidth

1070
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,760
um so yeah i guess that's

1071
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,839
that's my approach right now

1072
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,090
yeah i think i think i tend to agree

1073
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,240
[Music]

1074
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,280
i mean i think um

1075
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,960
the thing that concerns me and i think

1076
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,319
the thing that's concerned me for a

1077
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,280
little while is

1078
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,280
is the participation right so i mean

1079
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,599
um

1080
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,920
bill and and i mainly bail

1081
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,319
you know we've been working on the

1082
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,800
architecture for a while granted it

1083
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,839
hasn't been

1084
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,599
uh consistent right it's uh

1085
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,599
like a sine wave right like we get

1086
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:22,800
involved with it and then

1087
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,359
other things overtake with priority and

1088
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,839
then we can come back to it and so on

1089
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,880
i i guess um i have no problem with

1090
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,079
proposal a

1091
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,400
i would just you know we'll keep putting

1092
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,400
out calls for participation i guess

1093
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,119
right like um

1094
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,560
so when we see reviews or um like when

1095
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,760
roman

1096
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,839
posted his review and kathleen posted

1097
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:51,520
hers

1098
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,880
um yeah i think it would just be nice to

1099
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,200
have

1100
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,560
additional participation in these things

1101
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,760
if that makes sense so i have a question

1102
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,880
in adam before you

1103
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,160
kind of yeah before you walk away which

1104
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,000
is

1105
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,520
do you believe it's do you have any

1106
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,160
feeling

1107
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,400
i don't know if it's a belief or as an

1108
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,760
evidence by anything

1109
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,040
do you have any uh opinion on

1110
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,200
is it easier to participate against

1111
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,960
a you know kind of a a demo piece of

1112
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,440
code

1113
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,119
versus um i mean i've read the

1114
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,960
architecture draft i'm not sure

1115
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,839
really what the meaningful feedback can

1116
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:36,319
be

1117
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:37,839
yeah we've had this conversation and i

1118
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:41,040
know we've had this kind of you know

1119
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,720
without exploring some of it and so

1120
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,400
so i obviously have a bias but what's

1121
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,319
your thoughts

1122
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,440
yeah i mean it's a what

1123
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,480
i i think i would ideally like to see is

1124
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,599
two implementations of what we have

1125
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,040
written

1126
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,680
um or close to what we have written so

1127
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,440
that they inform what we have written

1128
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,880
right

1129
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,960
um and i think we've said that for a

1130
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,559
little while at this point like

1131
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,680
that the draft is where it is but

1132
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,160
we can't

1133
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,960
let me rephrase that we probably

1134
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,520
shouldn't

1135
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,800
move too much more on the draft without

1136
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,680
experimenting and ensuring that it it's

1137
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,319
actually

1138
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:32,000
you know that is something that can be

1139
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,839
efficaciously implemented

1140
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,319
and that to me means that we should have

1141
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,280
at least one

1142
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,480
preferably at least two

1143
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,240
um implementations that could

1144
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,240
potentially work together right like

1145
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,359
um so um

1146
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,400
and this isn't necessarily just an atom

1147
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,400
question but you're using opendxl

1148
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,920
does does anybody else in the working

1149
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,599
group have an opinion of

1150
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,920
you know is that something to build on

1151
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,160
um

1152
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,880
there are objections to building

1153
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,480
prototypes on top of that

1154
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,559
i mean you know it's obviously not an

1155
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,280
ietf technology

1156
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,839
i'd love to hear some feedback on that

1157
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,839
because presumably if we did

1158
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,000
some kind of alternate implementation

1159
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,520
that might be able to work with

1160
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,960
the cis implementation um

1161
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,880
sorry bill if that's not how i should

1162
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,839
phrase it maybe it's the bill

1163
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,040
implementation

1164
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,079
um then you know

1165
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,839
does anybody have objections against

1166
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,960
opendxl

1167
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,040
just a quick comment before anyone

1168
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,079
objects or not

1169
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,000
um and i think bill

1170
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,720
you might have to keep me honest but um

1171
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,880
i think the use of opendxl

1172
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,480
is something that we can rely on for

1173
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,640
implementations it's not something we

1174
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,760
would require

1175
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,680
for the architecture i would prefer to

1176
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:09,118
see the architecture draft

1177
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:27,839
like message fabric agnostic

1178
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,839
[Music]

1179
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,599
okay anyone else

1180
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,119
yeah i think the funny thing for me

1181
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,880
right now is that i expected this to be

1182
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,920
the

1183
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,960
animated part of the meeting and i seem

1184
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,480
to have taken all the air out of the

1185
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,720
rain

1186
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,760
[Music]

1187
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,280
go ahead hank yeah so um

1188
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,720
i really want to have a and then people

1189
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,359
have to do

1190
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,400
bandwidth to do that as just i hate it

1191
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,040
and i i'm not doing a at the moment as

1192
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,720
apparent it's very apparent

1193
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,640
so um so uh um

1194
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,680
i'm i'm i can only commit to be and i

1195
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,520
would really like to see a happening

1196
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,200
without being a part of the solution

1197
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,240
right now

1198
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,960
so so that's why i was hesitant to uh to

1199
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,520
speak up so because what's that

1200
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,359
kind of an opinion you know not helping

1201
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,800
the only wish list

1202
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,440
no contribution well that is not helping

1203
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,599
so so that is why i'm speaking last year

1204
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,440
i think

1205
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,839
well that's helpful actually hank so if

1206
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,359
others are in that boat that

1207
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,760
the chairs the av we would really like

1208
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,640
to hear that actually

1209
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,760
yeah i think right

1210
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,440
um adding to this um bill was

1211
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,200
talking about um and that's a side

1212
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,800
conversation here with chat about that

1213
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,079
also um

1214
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:12,880
about uh mqtt as the uh the broker

1215
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,400
solution here used

1216
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,480
so uh so uh uh personally uh uh having

1217
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,760
worked with xmbp mqtt amqp

1218
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,640
and everything uh what we internally

1219
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,599
used when

1220
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,000
building broker uh or inter broker

1221
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,119
systems

1222
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,640
for for years now even with itf

1223
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,800
hackathons at i don't know 90 something

1224
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:36,000
itfs um we used kafka

1225
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
because kafka was basically the broker

1226
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,000
tool to buy to rule them all it was so

1227
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,520
easy to implement that we could

1228
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,720
combine yang push with xmpp and because

1229
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,480
the interfaces were i don't know

1230
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,280
a little bit clunky sometimes um we just

1231
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,440
use kafka as a broker in between

1232
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,359
it was easier to write anything else so

1233
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,440
so that is what we were stuck with so

1234
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,680
so when i think about uh implementing

1235
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,599
second for example at some point

1236
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,400
um i think that the broker should be

1237
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,359
exchangeable

1238
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,359
and that's what we need an architecture

1239
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,760
for uh the architecture tells you

1240
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,000
what solution will fit here mqtt is the

1241
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,800
proof of comp

1242
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,040
concept and if mqtt can do the trick

1243
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,480
kafka can also do it

1244
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,880
and so uh so that is something i would

1245
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:17,680
uh uh

1246
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,800
um voice interest in

1247
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,079
and uh but but i guess that in the

1248
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,839
current itf iteration that i would have

1249
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:29,839
not even close to any bandwidth left for

1250
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:30,240
that

1251
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,559
but but i think that the uh the the idea

1252
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:33,920
of an architecture is

1253
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,480
exactly about that and bill's code is

1254
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,680
facilitating a proof

1255
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,599
of concept for exactly that and that is

1256
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,800
nice to see

1257
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,160
because i then will i think have another

1258
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,040
cool tool to work with and if the second

1259
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,160
architecture fits that

1260
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:57,359
it would be very very happy

1261
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,440
okay um

1262
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,599
so it go ahead ramen

1263
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,520
yeah i was just wanted to if we got to

1264
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:10,880
the point where no one else had

1265
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,319
additional comment comments i wanted to

1266
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:12,800
share

1267
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,920
my particular bias if that's okay uh

1268
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,200
yeah just let me uh

1269
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,880
go back and clarify one tiny thing um

1270
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,280
that which was related to the to the

1271
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,160
rolling documents

1272
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,880
so we adopted the really software

1273
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,520
descriptor

1274
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,040
it's expired we

1275
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,599
did a rolly configuration checklist uh

1276
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:38,400
which was

1277
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,880
uh an individual which is still an

1278
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,839
individual submission and it has expired

1279
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,400
so um that's why i have not put rolly on

1280
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:46,960
these

1281
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,640
either of the really documents on this

1282
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,180
list

1283
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,200
[Music]

1284
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,920
and i think possibly the primary

1285
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,000
proponents of the

1286
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,440
documents are not in the meeting this

1287
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,880
morning so um

1288
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,559
anyway so now you go ahead roman

1289
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,280
thanks uh so i guess my personal

1290
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,280
observation is that i see a lot of

1291
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,079
aspiration to potentially do more but

1292
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,119
not a lot of

1293
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,400
energy or plan how to get there so

1294
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,200
we for a long time have been limping

1295
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,640
along for a very

1296
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,440
wide scope in the charter but the work

1297
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,319
that we're doing

1298
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,799
is not commensurate with the wide scope

1299
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:29,680
we have

1300
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,960
so i i think really to get us to closure

1301
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,040
i think we need to focus all our energy

1302
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,359
on finishing the very few limited things

1303
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,240
that we have

1304
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,440
which i believe are some of the

1305
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,960
milestones that's outlined in proposal a

1306
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,640
then i think really is a question of

1307
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,400
what happens after that

1308
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,559
and as a forcing function to make sure

1309
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,520
we have sufficient energy

1310
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,000
what i would like for us to do is to

1311
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,160
actually modify if we decide we want

1312
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,799
more

1313
00:55:56,799 --> 00:55:58,640
we would actually modify the charter to

1314
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,079
be very specific

1315
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,000
to the new things we would take on

1316
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,280
because i think the current charter

1317
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,000
language you have

1318
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,319
frankly doesn't doesn't work for it

1319
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,839
doesn't work for said future

1320
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,359
and if it turns out we have all that

1321
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,680
energy wonderful we can kind of do that

1322
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,799
but what works with proposal a is

1323
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,520
that we have a switch that says if we

1324
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
don't have energy which frankly

1325
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,799
you know the last kind of two years on

1326
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,319
the mailing list have demonstrated you

1327
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:23,839
know we have a graceful exit where we

1328
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:24,400
can declare

1329
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,720
success on on the focused things that we

1330
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,599
have

1331
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,040
what i would like to hear i didn't hear

1332
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,359
anyone pushing for it for proposal b

1333
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:31,760
actually

1334
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,920
i heard everyone push for proposal a so

1335
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,760
this may be kind of a non-sequitur i

1336
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,200
think the some of the challenges with

1337
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,079
proposal b

1338
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,000
is when you when you put a working group

1339
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,480
on pause that's not an official thing

1340
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,880
and we don't have a good criteria to

1341
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,559
decide how to light that back

1342
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,880
up frankly and what appealed to me for

1343
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,839
proposal a

1344
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,720
is we have an approach to light that up

1345
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,200
and then

1346
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,520
selfishly for me about why even keep the

1347
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,520
working group open as long as january

1348
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,640
2022

1349
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,160
is that i envision that there's going to

1350
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,680
be some iesg time

1351
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,240
to iterate revised comments uh on the

1352
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,680
architecture and the coast with and

1353
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,319
that's

1354
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:07,520
that's sometimes a little bit of an

1355
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,359
unpredictable timeline and having a

1356
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,799
working group to help resolve those

1357
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:11,359
comments

1358
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,359
is actually a lot easier than one that's

1359
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,119
disbanded

1360
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,640
right okay but i didn't hear anyone

1361
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,920
advocating for anything other than

1362
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,359
proposal a

1363
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,799
yeah i haven't heard anything besides

1364
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,799
proposal a either

1365
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,480
the other observation i would make on

1366
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,559
your comment about narrowing the scope

1367
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,319
is i feel like the last time we

1368
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,000
recharted we had that exact same

1369
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,520
conversation where we were like we're

1370
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,280
going to narrow our scope and i guess

1371
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,960
from your perspective the scope is still

1372
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,760
much broader than what we're actually

1373
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,559
accomplishing

1374
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,559
and we've been down this road once

1375
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,240
already where we tried to narrow it

1376
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,839
um and get concise things um

1377
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,680
so completely agree um so given that i'm

1378
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,319
not seeing

1379
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,040
um a ton of people in the queue at the

1380
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,359
moment

1381
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,160
and i see a plus one from ira in the

1382
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,480
chat for proposal a

1383
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,280
i think we i mean we will do a really

1384
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:05,760
quick

1385
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,799
confirm this on the mailing list

1386
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,480
but uh

1387
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,119
i i the consensus of this meeting

1388
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:18,799
definitely appears to be proposal a

1389
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:22,079
and

1390
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
i guess there's really not more much

1391
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,280
more to talk about here on this

1392
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:28,640
um so

1393
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,160
fine question karen if we're really

1394
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,319
heading down the path of uh proposal a

1395
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,440
which is what it looks like

1396
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,839
you know there's i think two potential

1397
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,520
there's one negotiation thing

1398
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,359
that if we can try to get feedback on as

1399
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,559
well which is the dates of december 2020

1400
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,680
and january 2022 were added

1401
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,599
do we or do we think we can finish the

1402
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:48,960
document sooner is

1403
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,240
december too much time

1404
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:03,330
[Music]

1405
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,839
i i can offer a comment on that um

1406
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,280
it's kind of off the cuff but um

1407
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,040
relative to what i was saying earlier

1408
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,559
about preferring to have

1409
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,880
one preferably two implementations

1410
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,870
rolling on it

1411
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:20,000
[Music]

1412
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,680
and this assuming that those

1413
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,559
implementations will help inform

1414
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,760
the shape of the draft

1415
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,240
i would say we could leave it as is

1416
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,839
right now

1417
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,700
and see if we can pull it in after

1418
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,359
[Music]

1419
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,359
getting one or two implementations more

1420
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:47,839
fully baked

1421
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,839
okay um

1422
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,879
i think the other thing is um

1423
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,599
i mean the december 21 i don't remember

1424
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,520
if that was something you proposed or

1425
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,280
something i came up with roman um so

1426
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:12,319
guys said that dude okay um

1427
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,839
the i i guess we we have no idea what

1428
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,920
the future of ietf meetings is but i i

1429
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,319
think um

1430
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,000
in particular some some working groups

1431
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,160
work really well without face-to-face

1432
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,920
meetings and for better for worse this

1433
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,079
appears to be a working group that

1434
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:30,079
does derive some energy and motivation

1435
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,599
from a regular

1436
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,520
face-to-face meeting and and i think

1437
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,359
we're making progress in hackathons

1438
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:37,520
and i think it's proving to be a lot

1439
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,480
more difficult

1440
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,400
um for us in this world so

1441
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,160
um all right so proposal a

1442
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,680
is our choice of the meeting and we will

1443
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,000
reconfirm it on the mailing list

1444
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,040
um and

1445
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:56,160
that takes us back to any other business

1446
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,000
the only other any other business i had

1447
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,760
was um

1448
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,400
i don't think and and chris you can you

1449
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,200
can speak up

1450
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,559
here as well oh i see uh

1451
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:11,680
we don't have um plans for a virtual

1452
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,000
um

1453
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,359
i

1454
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,119
the problem with parallel chat streams

1455
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:23,359
is you can get lose track

1456
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:25,839
um

1457
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,839
oh okay kathleen yeah i just have

1458
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:34,000
i find that energy associated with face

1459
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:34,960
to face

1460
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,839
sort of revitalizes my uh motivation but

1461
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:38,720
anyway

1462
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,000
um i would agree is it better for us to

1463
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,920
actually

1464
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,079
i know that if we schedule if we

1465
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,280
schedule

1466
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:52,160
um roman you can tell me i'm wrong if we

1467
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,280
schedule kind of

1468
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,000
semi-regular design type meetings then

1469
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,920
those have to be

1470
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,400
announced in minutes and the rest right

1471
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,839
um

1472
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,000
just like a virtual interim uh so

1473
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,920
technically design team meetings don't

1474
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,839
need that but if we do an interim we

1475
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,160
would

1476
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,760
right and so karen i would i would ask

1477
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,440
and i would ask the group

1478
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,280
would we rather do you know have a

1479
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:22,480
supported bi-weekly

1480
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,839
um maybe you know more than that less

1481
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:26,799
than that i don't know

1482
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:31,200
uh or would we rather schedule an intro

1483
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,520
yeah if i could repeat that kind of

1484
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,039
chris in another way

1485
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,319
if we really say december 2021 is

1486
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,240
the date that we either have it done or

1487
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:42,240
we're wrapping up that's

1488
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,359
two more formal meetings that's the the

1489
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:47,119
summer one and the fall one

1490
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,119
i can't prognosticate and this is not an

1491
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,240
official statement

1492
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,559
uh kind of for anyone but i don't know

1493
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,599
whether we're gonna really meet in

1494
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:54,160
person

1495
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,839
in the summer time so best case we're

1496
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,000
maybe talking about one in-person

1497
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,240
meeting and if we really just have two

1498
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,079
more meetings to close this

1499
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,240
i i really think we need more

1500
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,000
intermediate milestones to

1501
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,599
to make sure we make progress

1502
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,880
um yeah i might have uh

1503
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,200
my my commentary on face-to-face

1504
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,240
meetings was more about

1505
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,240
what it was was less about

1506
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,319
setting our milestones i i think the

1507
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,480
miles there's four months between now

1508
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,000
and the next meeting are almost

1509
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,440
five months i don't think we can sit

1510
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,640
around and wait

1511
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,400
uh if we really think we're going to

1512
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,240
meet the end of the year deadline i

1513
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:39,520
think we need to see some progress

1514
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,039
between now and then the question is

1515
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:41,839
whether

1516
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,880
that progress needs to be driven by the

1517
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,400
chairs scheduling virtual interim

1518
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,680
meetings or whether it needs to be

1519
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,280
driven by

1520
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,400
the primary editors of the architecture

1521
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,680
document

1522
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,359
scheduling architecture

1523
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:01,759
editing meetings um

1524
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,520
so uh i i

1525
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,680
i mean perhaps chris and i could have

1526
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,760
done a better job of scheduling virtual

1527
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,319
interims

1528
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,000
although between the last meeting and

1529
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,319
this one was kind of tough i think but

1530
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,920
do you all want a virtual interim or

1531
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,520
adam i mean

1532
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,640
you and bill what do you think

1533
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,480
i mean i think we can make the the

1534
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,240
design team meetings

1535
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,359
and when we can announce them on the

1536
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:32,559
mailing list anybody can come

1537
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,000
it's really about who's driving the

1538
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,480
agenda

1539
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,880
yeah so um kind of having an open

1540
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,400
conversation with bill in front of

1541
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,680
everybody but um

1542
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,960
to me i think that the more frequently

1543
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,559
we meet the better uh but that said

1544
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:52,799
bill's the one who really does most of

1545
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,160
the implementation stuff

1546
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,599
like all of it actually and um so

1547
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,280
it's really going to depend on his

1548
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,119
availability

1549
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,960
um that sort of thing but i mean

1550
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,960
to me the more frequent meetings things

1551
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,799
just get done right you can

1552
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:11,280
chunk things up into smaller bites it's

1553
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,960
easier to take those smaller bites

1554
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,200
it's more regular it's more front of

1555
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,559
mind all of that so

1556
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,079
my preference would be to meet more

1557
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:21,599
frequently than

1558
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,039
scheduling virtual interims

1559
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,640
bill feel free to uh throw me under a

1560
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,400
bus or you know

1561
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,480
push me off a cliff whatever makes sense

1562
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,520
i i would agree and um

1563
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,079
you know i can i can take an action item

1564
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:42,799
uh

1565
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,280
i'll have to go you know back to my boss

1566
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,400
who's kind of a hard case

1567
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,000
uh about uh scheduling um

1568
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,440
but uh yeah we'll take that as

1569
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,039
as an action to find find times where we

1570
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:57,520
can

1571
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,630
uh get some editing meetings scheduled

1572
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:02,079
[Music]

1573
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,839
okay um

1574
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,280
so so the action will be for

1575
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,920
between now and the next ietf meeting

1576
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,799
will be for you

1577
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,200
all to schedule meetings and report back

1578
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,839
to the working group

1579
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,319
and uh chris i don't know if you want to

1580
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:28,319
speak up on this do you have a

1581
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:31,839
do you want to plan for you know

1582
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:33,599
penciling in a virtual interim

1583
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,240
halfway between or do we want to just i

1584
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,920
think a short virtual interim is

1585
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,839
probably a good thing if the design

1586
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,240
meetings actually take them there

1587
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,280
you know it just puts a marker in the

1588
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,200
ground of progress

1589
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,720
i would say if we have something to talk

1590
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,520
about a virtual interim

1591
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,200
you know for folks who may not be

1592
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,039
involved in design meetings say

1593
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:57,039
a person like hank who can't commit to

1594
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:58,799
that might be useful

1595
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,200
hank i mean for folks like you jessica

1596
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,720
maybe

1597
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,440
would you guys find that useful i don't

1598
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,640
want to have a meeting that

1599
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,920
no one feels the need to have

1600
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,319
i absolutely would like to spend some

1601
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:15,920
regular interval time

1602
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,400
on getting up to things and discussing

1603
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,119
why things

1604
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,359
are there how they are in implementation

1605
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,400
i have to admit i have no idea how the

1606
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,559
implementation looks like i'm not even

1607
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:28,720
sure what to look at it and so

1608
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,039
um so yeah uh like like starting these

1609
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,000
meetings for

1610
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,039
a catching up uh is also a

1611
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,480
there's a blocker on my schedule you

1612
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,359
know i i call in there is time

1613
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,359
reserved for that it's easier than to

1614
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,920
say i will do it at some point so yes

1615
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,440
structure

1616
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:49,839
is very very come here for me at least

1617
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,559
same for me i'm not really good this

1618
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,240
pandemic about like actually following

1619
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,520
up on but if you put it on my

1620
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,079
calendar

1621
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:59,200
i might um i guess i would like to see

1622
01:07:59,200 --> 01:07:59,599
us

1623
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,680
use a little bit of time to talk about

1624
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,520
deconflicting a bunch of efforts

1625
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,559
as well i think kathleen's out of

1626
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:08,079
station document

1627
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:10,480
has a role here i know there's related

1628
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,599
work in oca

1629
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:13,760
that's very similar to what adam and

1630
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,039
bill are trying to do here i'd like for

1631
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,120
us to take some time to like

1632
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,640
really sit down and figure out what are

1633
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,719
we doing and where are we doing it

1634
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,520
um with the knowledge that you know i

1635
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,120
know adam and bill are like

1636
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,960
throwing this boat alone so i think we

1637
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,719
need to do some resource allocation as

1638
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:29,040
well

1639
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,238
um to the extent possible so

1640
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,158
jessica do you want to have that kind of

1641
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,158
deconfliction here or do you

1642
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,479
envision that like some of these

1643
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,920
follow-on meetings

1644
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,920
i i was envisioning it in the follow-on

1645
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,439
meetings only because i think there's a

1646
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:44,960
lot of nuance to a lot of these things

1647
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,238
but i think we need to

1648
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,359
set that scope early enough to be sure

1649
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,560
all the right participants are there

1650
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,880
okay thank you

1651
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,198
that's it so maybe a virtual interim

1652
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:03,359
to discuss architecture and to discuss

1653
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,560
deconfliction

1654
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,799
announced well in advance of when it's

1655
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:09,520
going to be scheduled

1656
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,560
yeah and i think jessica adam others

1657
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,198
will need your help to to get maybe some

1658
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:18,640
of the non-ietf participants to

1659
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,520
to at least have one conversation with

1660
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,679
us

1661
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:28,960
[Music]

1662
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,960
okay um

1663
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,799
so coming out of this

1664
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:39,439
uh adam and bill are going to schedule

1665
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,359
design team meetings design team slash

1666
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,319
editing meetings

1667
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,238
and chris and i will schedule a virtual

1668
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:47,040
interim in roughly two months

1669
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,640
the agenda of the virtual interim will

1670
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,479
be

1671
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,158
a touch point on where the the

1672
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:53,759
architecture document is and

1673
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,880
it will be deconfliction does that sound

1674
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,440
like our plan

1675
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,600
[Music]

1676
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,760
all right any other any other business

1677
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,159
besides uh

1678
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,360
hank's desire to go through the

1679
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:16,380
issues of the coast with

1680
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,480

1681
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,159
okay um

1682
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,400
so that is the approach we will take uh

1683
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,199
at this point i'm going to close the

1684
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:30,560
main meeting and

1685
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,320
hand it over to well let me i i mean

1686
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,360
we didn't actually ask roman if if he

1687
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,360
wanted to sit if he wanted to work on

1688
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:40,800
issues now or if he wanted to do it

1689
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,719
later so perhaps we should do that

1690
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,640
celery closure in the document i'm happy

1691
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,080
to walk through

1692
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,360
walk through that list from my

1693
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,440
perspective it's what i put on the

1694
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,320
mailing list

1695
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,400
it's i put a link in the in the chat as

1696
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,840
well and it's also in the document

1697
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,840
history

1698
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:12,480
go ahead somebody said something

1699
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,840
uh let me let hank share his screen just

1700
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,640
share

1701
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,920
if possible um yeah let me grant you the

1702
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,679
screen

1703
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,360
oh wait i have to unshear mine first

1704
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:27,839
hold on a sec

1705
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,600
discussion or if uh if we're good on

1706
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,840
notes

1707
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,280
i uh hank do you i wasn't making this

1708
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,880
part of the minute so do you want this

1709
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,320
minute or do you

1710
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,960
um actually i'm not sure yes it seems

1711
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,000
like a good idea to

1712
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,440
capture maybe maybe basing minutes on

1713
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,199
the email or something

1714
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,280
i'm going to share my entire screen

1715
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,760
which is typically a very bad idea but i

1716
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,960
want to share

1717
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,760
two windows at the same time so first we

1718
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,000
go

1719
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,760
all the way down

1720
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,880
and then this does it does it show

1721
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,600
appropriately

1722
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,679
to some extent two windows should be uh

1723
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,679
visible yes

1724
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,360
cool so yeah that's

1725
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,320
i'm sorry sorry i was gonna say okay

1726
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,199
thank you bill for

1727
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,280
taking what notes you can and so at this

1728
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,560
point

1729
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,159
i'm considering this to be an editing

1730
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,679
meeting so those who

1731
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,560
are not necessarily involved may feel

1732
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,760
free to step away

1733
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:47,280
all right hank you are now

1734
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,320
running the meeting so to speak

1735
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,760
uh of course you are so um thanks roman

1736
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,679
for the time

1737
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,480
uh i will not be able to uh speak with

1738
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,480
confidence to everything because summer

1739
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,760
this and this is yeah

1740
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,280
the commit from dave waltermeier

1741
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,520
to the text so we can dig up some of the

1742
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,320
items but i'm

1743
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,560
familiar with most like with eighty to

1744
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,080
ninety percent of the items

1745
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,199
um so we're starting with the version

1746
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,560
hank dave's on now

1747
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,550
hi dave why am i doing this

1748
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:23,040
[Laughter]

1749
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:26,719
dave could also talk to this so

1750
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:33,840
does your mic work

1751
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,760
dave yeah i'm not going

1752
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,120
dave um but we've ended the

1753
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,880
thing and now we've transitioned to

1754
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,640
editing uh

1755
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,800
coast with and we didn't notice when you

1756
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,840
joined so

1757
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,360
um can you speak are you

1758
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,080
yeah maybe he's here in his advertising

1759
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,280
okay let's start with

1760
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,719
um in any case

1761
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,840
so uh um running through the items as i

1762
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,520
see them here right now

1763
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,800
um you annotated them with when

1764
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,960
since when does this apply or when did

1765
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,600
you check this i think it's the

1766
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:18,159
first one

1767
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,239
um yeah the nomenclature of the

1768
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,040
draft version so i think we've seen 15

1769
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,080
16 and 17

1770
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,880
15 was the original review so where

1771
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,520
possible

1772
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,400
i tried to annotate it in such a way

1773
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,159
where it was clear that the comment

1774
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,640
was first made in that document in some

1775
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,280
cases

1776
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,199
text changes have occurred or discussion

1777
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,719
has occurred so

1778
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:46,000
uh so i annotated it below sometimes

1779
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,520
talking about multiple version numbers

1780
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,960
as you might see in the next entry

1781
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,440
around

1782
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:52,719
section 2.9.4 where there's commentary

1783
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,640
on the 16 and the 17 as well

1784
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,800
ah now i get it so the stars indicate

1785
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,800
the item and you have two multiplica i

1786
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,320
see now okay now i get it

1787
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:02,640
that was a little bit uh this is even

1788
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:03,600
less than i thought

1789
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,480
because the stars indicated yeah as you

1790
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:06,880
know

1791
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,640
thank you um first item

1792
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,000
is since 15 uh so so the

1793
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,719
the the initial the initial response of

1794
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:17,920
the editors was

1795
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,480
we don't get the question so uh let me

1796
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,080
try to reflect what we

1797
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,920
understand or what i now understand here

1798
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,320
you hinted versioning

1799
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,080
beyond the native support of sibor the

1800
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,120
versioning of sibor is called tagging do

1801
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,679
you mean that

1802
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,480
yeah i mean what i meant there was there

1803
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,120
is no

1804
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,280
version field being jammed into the

1805
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,719
coast wind i was

1806
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,560
checking whether that's an explicit

1807
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,640
design

1808
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,199
that's an explicit design uh and it's

1809
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:54,560
really as simple as

1810
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,520
do we need a tag in uh in the coast

1811
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,760
width that says this is version

1812
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,280
1.0 or whatever we want to call it

1813
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:06,320
okay so then in some future so in some

1814
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,080
future version if we do update it there

1815
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,600
would be a 1.1

1816
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,920
and i wasn't exactly sure how that was

1817
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,120
handled with

1818
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,239
the in the in the xml in the

1819
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,320
uh in the original kind of squid format

1820
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,600
but i also since there's

1821
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,199
a little bit of a divergence so i didn't

1822
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:24,159
want to have one driving the other

1823
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,480
i see so i think what you mean then is

1824
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,080
beyond the data support provided in

1825
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,280
cdda in the cds specifications oh yeah

1826
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,640
yeah sorry it doesn't really

1827
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,560
mean okay because we were like why a

1828
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:35,760
mistake yeah

1829
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,239
okay so so yeah so that makes it that

1830
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:39,679
this is what we thought

1831
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:42,960
and uh so no there is no

1832
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,880
versioning of the cdda specifications

1833
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,360
and that is intentional because versions

1834
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,440
are things that always

1835
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,760
are difficult to align in when you think

1836
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,199
about the iot

1837
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:58,560
so uh so the idea is here to have a

1838
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,679
very stable core specification that you

1839
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:02,000
can

1840
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,120
extend this specifications again and

1841
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,960
these specifications you can pull in or

1842
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:07,360
not

1843
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,920
every parser or encoding mechanism or

1844
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,360
decoding mechanism

1845
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,640
should be careful with things that

1846
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,880
that are extensible and check what it

1847
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,000
knows and

1848
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,719
and and just not assume that uh uh there

1849
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:21,120
are

1850
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,120
items in a in a map that you are

1851
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,400
familiar with or even

1852
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,080
complete sub-maps that you are familiar

1853
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,920
with so that's uh

1854
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,760
more like a scalable approach to

1855
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,440
versioning versioning

1856
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,840
should be solved outside of cddi in

1857
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,719
general

1858
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:38,000
uh there is sometimes a thing some city

1859
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:38,960
specifications

1860
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,840
use something like a qualified name for

1861
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,360
their structures for example if you

1862
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,640
define a protocol

1863
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,920
like update or delete like crud messages

1864
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,239
with ctga you can you can give that

1865
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,560
operation a qualified name that also

1866
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,440
tells you

1867
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,159
i am i am the first of my kind and

1868
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,760
another operation would be at the same

1869
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,280
operation name but tells you

1870
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,360
but i am the second version of my kind

1871
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,800
that that it is

1872
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,040
possible to do this with qualified names

1873
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,120
um again that would be per

1874
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,480
uh uh nested structure in the ctl for

1875
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,560
example operations or

1876
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,080
payload types or unions or something

1877
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,440
we are not doing this here with

1878
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,719
co-switch because we have a very very uh

1879
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:22,239
flexible extensive

1880
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:25,360
extensibility mechanism that should

1881
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,840
allow for for emitting versions we are

1882
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,040
not elaborating

1883
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,360
about this in text because that is

1884
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,080
basically

1885
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,199
explaining how cdi works in a

1886
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,600
respect that uh uses cti so i think

1887
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:38,320
that's not the

1888
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,679
correct place to do that would you agree

1889
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,800
so let me replay that conversation this

1890
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,239
co swift specification is just trying to

1891
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,320
trying to come up with an alternative

1892
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:53,280
data model to what we already do in xml

1893
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,719
in the suit format

1894
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,239
and the suite format in its xml

1895
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,480
manifestation doesn't have an explicit

1896
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,360
version number

1897
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,280
and that it's probably i guess handled

1898
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,120
by some namespace versioning

1899
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,320
and we are handling

1900
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,960
that namespace versioning that swit does

1901
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,080
in cdl

1902
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,320
by you're just going to recognize it by

1903
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:16,640
the fields that are in there

1904
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,120
um the swift has a

1905
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,199
identifier for different version which

1906
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,960
is the year

1907
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,360
that's because it's an iso standard so

1908
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,239
uh i think

1909
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,600
current is 2015.

1910
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,280
um some would say this is a version

1911
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,719
um so how do we handle that here

1912
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:41,840
we say that the specification text

1913
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,719
says on what specification this is based

1914
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,520
and that's the iso version from 2015.

1915
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,280
the cdda does not express this

1916
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,760
so how will we know because i was under

1917
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,360
the impression from how dave answered

1918
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,199
some of the earlier questions that iso

1919
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,719
is going to update their

1920
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,800
their version so we're going to have a

1921
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,080
2015 one

1922
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,280
uh and our suite our coast with thing

1923
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,800
will only ever align to

1924
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,080
2015 or are we gonna how do we future

1925
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,840
proof it that when we do an update to

1926
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,800
this because i assume there will be

1927
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,360
interest

1928
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,440
to do that how will we recognize the

1929
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,639
2022 update versus the 2015 update

1930
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:22,639
is it really just gonna be well it's

1931
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:24,320
just there'll be new fields

1932
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,880
uh and that's how i'm gonna see it you

1933
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,560
know based on the normal cddl

1934
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,480
way exactly so um

1935
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,440
if the assumption is that uh it is very

1936
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,639
unlikely that the

1937
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:39,120
structure presented in the cta today

1938
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,159
will change

1939
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,920
and it is not intended to change

1940
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,159
actually there might be a critical

1941
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:46,639
error to all of this and then we have to

1942
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,880
go to abyss and actually change it

1943
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,960
um but i don't think that will happen

1944
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,199
actually to be honest but you never know

1945
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,679
uh the extensibility mechanism provided

1946
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:56,880
here will

1947
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,199
allow for a another um rfc or another id

1948
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,760
that basically uh extends the current

1949
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,480
ctda

1950
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:07,040
to the uh version that might be upcoming

1951
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,159
with iso

1952
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,560
but uh knowing that authors of the

1953
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,120
isospec are authors of the uh uh

1954
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,760
with spec um the ice respect will

1955
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,360
basically align

1956
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,159
more to the uh kosovo spec and that will

1957
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:20,400
be

1958
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,960
the next version iso but we do not know

1959
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,159
how future version will look like

1960
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,520
there's no assumptions

1961
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,159
make in the text how future version of

1962
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:28,960
iso will

1963
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,520
develop therefore we say that's not

1964
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,880
necessary here

1965
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,760
so just to be clear i'm an implementer i

1966
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,000
consume a coast with

1967
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,800
when i consume it i will not necessarily

1968
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,440
know

1969
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,239
whether it's the 2015 version or the

1970
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:45,320
updated

1971
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,760
2022 version if we go there i don't know

1972
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,120
that the only way i'll know that

1973
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:53,199
is by what

1974
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,520
i'm trying to contact you your parts so

1975
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,239
so uh

1976
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:57,920
i think from a software point of view

1977
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:59,600
you are a parser

1978
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,400
of course widths and you are using the

1979
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:03,600
initial version

1980
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,480
and you encounter a item it is allowed

1981
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,040
you are

1982
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,120
excited yeah that is a summer uh

1983
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,880
creeping in via extension points you

1984
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,000
don't know

1985
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,080
uh the any field could also so so you

1986
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,600
you can encounter a new thing that you

1987
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,400
don't know

1988
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,400
and you don't have an extension for that

1989
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,400
this all will be captured by

1990
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,880
the any attribute so you can parse it

1991
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:23,679
today

1992
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,840
due to the structure of the cdda but you

1993
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,360
don't know that's a future version it's

1994
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,040
just an unknown attribute to you

1995
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,880
if you if you are now the code that is

1996
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,159
updated you now

1997
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,719
know that it's a future version but you

1998
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:36,639
uh

1999
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:38,480
again arbitrary items go to the any

2000
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,560
attribute so this this this

2001
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,400
layering mechanism so to speak allows

2002
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,679
you to uh

2003
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,920
not use versions anymore it allows you

2004
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,280
to just be aware

2005
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,840
of the current state or not and parse

2006
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,960
any attribute

2007
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,960
any it's cause you get in any case you

2008
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,040
just have to do the careful passing

2009
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,520
with the any attribute as is always the

2010
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:00,639
case even for the very initial version

2011
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,360
i i understand that trickery i guess in

2012
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,040
the in terms of kind of the magic that

2013
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,080
the cdl provides

2014
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,520
i guess maybe i'm making more of a

2015
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,280
statement that

2016
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,520
i was left under the impression that

2017
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,480
everything

2018
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,040
that we have in swin will have a

2019
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,719
representation in coast with

2020
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,520
and what what i'm hearing you say is yes

2021
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,719
but

2022
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,800
so i feel like we're losing information

2023
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,320
that i have in suite

2024
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,280
in coast with because in suid i will

2025
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:27,679
have

2026
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:31,440
an explicit way to say i got the 2015

2027
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,080
thing

2028
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,040
and in coastwood we have an implicit

2029
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:37,760
understanding that i got the 2015

2030
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,280
and that's perhaps the point i'm drawing

2031
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,880
here okay

2032
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,199
so yeah but that is captured by the

2033
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,120
introduction that says this is a based

2034
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:45,520
on

2035
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,880
200 2015. you could added attributes and

2036
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:49,280
say

2037
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,280
we never but but i think we already say

2038
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,880
this this

2039
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,800
specification does not make any

2040
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,639
assumptions how the switch

2041
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,159
iso standard will evolve and uh

2042
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:02,480
however the voice we can parse it due to

2043
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,920
the nature of our structure

2044
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,880
and we already say that

2045
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:12,480
okay okay if that's feasible to you

2046
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,080
i think it's very feasible to things

2047
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,760
that are a difficult to version update

2048
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:16,639
so

2049
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,639
we don't expect kosovo to have millions

2050
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,080
of branches and versions

2051
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,199
so uh uh but but we adhere to the idea

2052
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,159
uh or the the benefits ctda provides uh

2053
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:26,719
and and

2054
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:28,080
that's basically the point why we don't

2055
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,000
have a version if you would really be

2056
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,920
at a month on adding a version that's

2057
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,120
that's a no-brainer

2058
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,400
but it is i think actually a blocker

2059
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:39,199
long long term

2060
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,360
yeah i mean listen if that's the design

2061
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:43,760
you want i my caution is i think that's

2062
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,920
going to break the future version but if

2063
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,440
if really what we want to do is have

2064
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,760
this very strict thing like we have in

2065
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,400
our one hand the 2015 thing and we're

2066
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,159
doing it based on the 2015 thing and

2067
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,760
we're comfortable with the drift

2068
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:57,600
i i i think that's fine because then

2069
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,440
we'll have the ietf coast with

2070
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,960
and then we have the squid that's kind

2071
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,080
of something else i mean that's the

2072
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,600
drift i think we're talking about but

2073
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,560
that's a design

2074
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,560
choice for for the working group i'm

2075
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,080
good you would have to do it next

2076
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,920
yeah but that's a comment now we will

2077
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,360
have to do another i

2078
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,120
i i see any case to update cosmic

2079
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,800
and and you can still do that without

2080
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,159
versioning

2081
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:21,040
but so with what caveat hank right which

2082
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:21,920
is

2083
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,440
if the semantic meaning changes of if

2084
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:29,120
if iso changes the semantic meaning of a

2085
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:30,159
data item in

2086
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:33,920
suit between say 15 and like a 22

2087
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,679
you can't make sense of that in co-suite

2088
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,280
that's correct then you may have to make

2089
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,360
a biz with that and you have to visit

2090
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,800
the original

2091
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,040
but but how would you know you have that

2092
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,800
so if i packed a

2093
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,400
2015 uh and made a co suite on the wire

2094
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,920
and it had field a

2095
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,920
and i have no versioning information

2096
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,360
then at some point

2097
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,920
uh you know the meaning of a change to

2098
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,480
be

2099
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,679
a a prime when i'm on the wire as an

2100
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:02,400
implementer

2101
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,400
and i read the switch the coast with

2102
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,239
because i don't have a version number

2103
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,320
i don't know how i because i don't know

2104
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:09,679
whether it's 2015

2105
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,440
or the new one that has the a prime

2106
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,040
definition what a

2107
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,679
what a means is it a or a prime but but

2108
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,920
you do because you're doing a conversion

2109
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,960
and the converter of course knows what

2110
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,040
version the new suite is

2111
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,800
and if the converter does not know what

2112
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,639
it's converting into the old switch and

2113
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:27,840
doesn't throw an error

2114
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,880
that's uh implementation problem and so

2115
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,080
of course you can't translate a new

2116
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,480
switch attributes from a future version

2117
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,400
that are not covered here of course it's

2118
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,400
that's apparent you can put them into

2119
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,679
the any field and just

2120
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:44,480
pass them through yes but also the

2121
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,600
converter

2122
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,920
would know because you implemented that

2123
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,840
and it knows that it passes a new thing

2124
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,600
now and if you're not implementing that

2125
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,320
correctly

2126
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,440
that is not a problem of the

2127
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,520
specification actually because a

2128
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,920
specification says this is equivalent to

2129
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,120
2015.

2130
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,120
an implementer how probably read that

2131
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,719
when implementing the spec so

2132
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:05,199
so again i think uh assuming that

2133
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,880
everything is updated correctly with

2134
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,840
versions in

2135
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,480
in a lot of things is unlikely it is it

2136
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,040
is

2137
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,679
i think more graceful to uh to have a

2138
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:15,440
ctda that allows for

2139
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,400
uh for the any attributer uh which we

2140
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,080
inherited from the from the uh swift

2141
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:20,800
rhyme uh

2142
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,520
natively actually so so i think still

2143
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:25,840
that this is a fine way to move forward

2144
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,360
wait so what's the converter we're

2145
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,520
talking about i'm confused because

2146
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,840
i thought that uh what was going to

2147
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,600
happen is some software producer was

2148
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,040
going to drop something in the file

2149
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,639
system for me and it's going to be a

2150
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,159
coast with blob

2151
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:41,360
and then i uh uh not knowing how the

2152
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,400
coast wood blob

2153
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,679
got red have find this blob on my file

2154
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:46,320
system

2155
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,639
and then i'm going to take my my

2156
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,480
implementation

2157
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,120
and i'm going to try to parse that blob

2158
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,280
i have a 2015

2159
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,440
implementation which has the definition

2160
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,520
of a i didn't know that

2161
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,400
the software producer made an it now

2162
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:02,880
read

2163
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,280
now instead of using the a definition

2164
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,080
uses the a

2165
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,239
prime definition and put that blob in my

2166
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,600
file system

2167
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,080
you can't use an a prime co-split

2168
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,600
because there is no a prime cosplay

2169
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,600
there's only a goes with

2170
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,600
because that's in the specification here

2171
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,600
if you create an a prime co-split it's

2172
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,639
it's something you made up

2173
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:24,320
because there's no specification for

2174
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,880
that right well right but again this is

2175
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,159
the future-proofing

2176
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:29,760
aspect of it because we think we're

2177
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,280
going to have to update it because

2178
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:33,199
in the discussion we said that there's a

2179
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,040
new new suid

2180
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,280
implementation coming so how will i know

2181
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,360
i have a new thing

2182
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,600
um you will have the new thing when you

2183
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,520
create a new thing and this is created

2184
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,719
via software

2185
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:46,800
so again it's this converter thing so

2186
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,800
when you have this notion of a version

2187
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,040
of switch and the version of code switch

2188
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,960
then you need something that makes this

2189
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,639
connection a software

2190
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:55,840
implementation that makes this

2191
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,360
connection and that is the software what

2192
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,320
i was talking about

2193
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,159
if you're just creating cosmetic and do

2194
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,360
not care about switch

2195
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,960
you don't have this problem you only

2196
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,639
have the problem when you have a new

2197
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:06,639
swift version as you are postulating

2198
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:09,040
and then you are creating with this new

2199
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,280
swift version something that as a new

2200
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,080
sorry a mismatching uh cement tech with

2201
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:15,440
an existing coast with and that is

2202
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,159
uncatched

2203
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:18,719
but that cannot happen if you adhere to

2204
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:19,920
the specification

2205
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,159
because uh you're not creating co-switch

2206
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:23,199
anymore uh

2207
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:24,800
and and therefore you because you know

2208
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,960
you know creating close with a prime

2209
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,440
that that fear would look like the same

2210
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,960
thing as the switch a prime you're

2211
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:31,760
postulating

2212
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,239
but there's no specification covering uh

2213
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:36,000
close with a prime so therefore it's an

2214
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,520
invalid code we're creating

2215
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,840
and it's very fine not to understand an

2216
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,880
energetic

2217
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,679
i think that that's appropriate so maybe

2218
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:44,080
again

2219
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,480
am i misunderstanding every time i drop

2220
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,440
a coast width

2221
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,440
on the file system there's an equivalent

2222
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,840
suit also there

2223
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,960
so that's how i know okay no so

2224
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,320
well right but so then i don't

2225
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,840
understand this implementation thing

2226
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:58,719
because

2227
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,639
i feel the piece of software that uh

2228
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,560
and with that software i got the coast

2229
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,719
with i don't i mean so this is now you

2230
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,560
know on my network and i have my

2231
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:10,719
old implementation that the 2015

2232
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:12,639
implementation i have no knowledge

2233
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:13,120
whether

2234
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,520
switz or coast winds got updated all i

2235
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:17,600
know is i have a file on my file system

2236
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,440
and i'm trying to consume it

2237
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,360
and when i consume it the only

2238
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,760
understanding of field a that i have is

2239
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,800
the one hard-coded in my implementation

2240
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,239
but unbeknownst to me the code switch

2241
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,960
the codes would work evolved and a is no

2242
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:34,480
longer a it's a

2243
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,920
prime so so it's kind of the

2244
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,600
so how would i recognize that if i don't

2245
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,600
have a version number is it that

2246
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:43,760
if that actually occurred what should

2247
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,280
have happened by the producer of the

2248
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:45,840
software

2249
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,840
they should have recognized that issue

2250
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,360
uh kind of from sweden they would have

2251
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:50,639
created a different tag

2252
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:52,080
and that tag would have been different

2253
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,920
my 2015 implementation wouldn't have

2254
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,679
recognized it and then it fails is that

2255
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,239
the fail-safe

2256
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,800
there is no fail-safe for something not

2257
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:02,639
doing versioning with their software

2258
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:05,920
no we do not build into the cda a

2259
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,960
uh a a solution for uh failing to do

2260
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:09,600
versioning

2261
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,320
no you're not doing that uh so if you

2262
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,199
are

2263
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:16,239
putting out a software onto a device

2264
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:18,960
that is actually consuming coswets and

2265
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,040
and therefore has to uh uh interpret

2266
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:21,600
them

2267
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,920
and then the if the software that you

2268
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,520
you put out there is abandoned for

2269
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,040
example the company goes away

2270
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,800
and it's not maintained anymore but

2271
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,600
still working so and now you

2272
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,440
have basically out of life software

2273
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,159
running and then you encounter a code

2274
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:37,440
suite that is newer

2275
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,000
but the software is not updated and can

2276
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,760
never be versioned anymore because it's

2277
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:42,719
abandoned

2278
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,040
then you will have a problem but i think

2279
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,239
when you arrive at that point you

2280
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,080
already had so many problems beforehand

2281
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,199
that you did not solve

2282
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:51,280
with respect to software management and

2283
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,239
versioning

2284
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,480
uh that that that's not the fault of the

2285
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,080
cddi and the coast where that is

2286
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,719
adhering

2287
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,199
to a based co switch which again is

2288
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:00,480
unlikely to happen

2289
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,320
um because that is the only problem here

2290
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,159
if the semantics change that is the only

2291
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:04,639
problem

2292
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,239
if you add more semantics that is not a

2293
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,320
problem uh with the original course

2294
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,120
right here

2295
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,080
so so uh if you if you encounter a that

2296
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,679
scenario where you have an abandoned

2297
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:14,719
piece of software

2298
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:17,040
not maintained they're running not aware

2299
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,719
and not versioned due to the versioning

2300
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:19,679
of the missing versioning

2301
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:22,880
of the new business coast with irc then

2302
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,280
you have a problem that is correct

2303
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,960
there's no failure detection for that if

2304
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:29,040
the semantic of tag it

2305
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,920
changed uh uh somehow and and when we

2306
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,080
made that happen we are abyss

2307
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,159
this software will never be able to

2308
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:41,199
understand that change that is correct

2309
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,840
yeah so i think i think i've reached the

2310
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,760
same conclusion that we don't need a

2311
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,760
change but for a different reason

2312
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,120
because i think that

2313
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,159
if the existing

2314
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:55,120
uh swit implementation changes to do

2315
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,440
this

2316
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:58,320
a versus a prime thing what should the

2317
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,679
right thing that should happen

2318
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,520
from the co switch side is that we would

2319
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,440
use a different tag for that field

2320
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:06,239
and then that would break the the uh the

2321
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:07,920
implementation the older implementation

2322
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,040
that's trying to consume it

2323
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,639
and that's perhaps how we would trigger

2324
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:12,560
it and so we're relying on

2325
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,800
the coast with ports to catch that and

2326
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,480
that's fine yeah okay exactly

2327
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,239
exactly that is fine the next version of

2328
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:20,080
cta would would make

2329
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:22,800
sure that the previous vision will fail

2330
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,520
that that is

2331
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,199
that is a very good way to do this

2332
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:26,880
exactly because we fail hard

2333
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,719
and then the the abandoned software that

2334
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:30,159
you should not use in any case anymore

2335
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,199
because of life

2336
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:35,920
will now fail hard when consuming this

2337
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,679
so since we had to spend about 20

2338
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:39,840
minutes on this before i got it could we

2339
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,400
put a sentence into that effect that we

2340
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,360
would expect

2341
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,760
uh future coast with versions that are

2342
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,719
tracking

2343
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:48,880
you know tracking kind of swin would

2344
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,719
create kind of new tags if said

2345
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:51,760
semantics occurred

2346
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:53,280
you know we explicitly aren't putting

2347
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,639
version numbers because that's not the

2348
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:56,960
cddl way

2349
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,280
yeah i think i think what what you could

2350
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:01,520
say is if if the semantics of the

2351
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,560
already defined codes would change

2352
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,560
uh this has to be expressed or this

2353
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,400
could be expressed via maybe

2354
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,480
not mandatory but and to prescriptively

2355
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,920
bad this could be expressed via

2356
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,840
a new tag and that is fine that's

2357
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,440
perfect yeah that makes perfect sense

2358
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:16,800
okay good let's do that

2359
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,120
okay thank you and that's sorry but but

2360
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,080
i think it's very

2361
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,760
important to talk about this because i

2362
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,760
think we had a mental disconnect here

2363
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,199
and it's also very for me very

2364
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:26,960
interesting to understand what that was

2365
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:27,760
and again

2366
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,960
i think it's 20 minutes where i spent

2367
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,530
no worries okay um

2368
01:34:33,530 --> 01:34:34,800
[Music]

2369
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,560
yeah there is no date field uh in uh

2370
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,280
uh in cttl we are using the time field

2371
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:44,000
uh as we are not typing x as date in

2372
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,719
switch we are having sx i think it's

2373
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:47,119
date

2374
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,440
time

2375
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:56,400
i think access date is not used in swit

2376
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,080
yeah i'm trying to catch up on the url

2377
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:02,559
link there

2378
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,800
so i thought that the recommendation

2379
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:15,840
made on the mailing list

2380
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:22,080
oh that is a different issue uh so uh

2381
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,560
yeah data has nothing to do with time

2382
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,440
date is like

2383
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:28,639
calendar stuff and uh and and such so

2384
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:29,199
and and

2385
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:32,000
time is is about time stamps and such so

2386
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,199
there are different types

2387
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,280
and you were talking about access date

2388
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,280
uh in the first place so i was uh maybe

2389
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,719
maybe taking this too literally maybe

2390
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:41,199
you meant

2391
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,679
uh what's it called an xml access date

2392
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:44,880
time i think right

2393
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,800
yeah that's the recommendation was to

2394
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,320
use excess date time

2395
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,840
i believe no yeah it it x daytime is the

2396
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:52,400
only

2397
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,000
uh time relevant uh value used in

2398
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,040
a type sorry for value used in the uh

2399
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:02,400
xsd and we decided to go with uh

2400
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:05,520
the binary one which is tag one time tag

2401
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:06,880
right

2402
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:09,520
and uh and but but there's one thing

2403
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,639
that we i

2404
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:14,000
actually elaborated on in the text uh

2405
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,840
there's a small discrepancy between zero

2406
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,360
and one zero is the

2407
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,639
standard uh iso time and a string and

2408
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,440
uh and that can express leap seconds

2409
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,560
because you can say

2410
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,199
it's 60 seconds you know but you can't

2411
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,320
express that with

2412
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:31,119
posix and you just may have to make very

2413
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,320
sure that you do not

2414
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,320
issue a signed uh a payload

2415
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,040
codes with on a leap second that would

2416
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:39,840
be

2417
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:42,320
bad because you don't know which second

2418
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:42,880
that is

2419
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,800
this is the bond before one after you

2420
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,880
don't never know

2421
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:48,800
there's no no standard that tells you

2422
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,840
which second it is actually

2423
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:53,840
unfortunately

2424
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,960
but for the sake of brevity and not

2425
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,719
using strings oh my god

2426
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:01,440
uh we are using time tag one and it's

2427
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,400
it's it's

2428
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,639
more than good enough uh you you just

2429
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:07,840
can't express leap seconds

2430
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:15,520
is that fine with you sorry i'm just i

2431
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,719
didn't see that

2432
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,440
change in the text i'm just trying to

2433
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,239
find it here

2434
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:22,718
that's all

2435
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:27,440
standby that is good

2436
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,080
because i thought the the resolution was

2437
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,679
clear i just didn't think it got merged

2438
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,040
into the text

2439
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:35,840
that's all i

2440
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,560
i think we're simply using

2441
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,239
integer time yeah

2442
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,000
i'm only with you this is dave's changes

2443
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,320
probably those are my changes

2444
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:53,440
actually yeah but i'm confused

2445
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:57,760
is integer time tag one

2446
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,880
yes oh

2447
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:03,760
string time is textual sorry yeah yeah

2448
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:04,159
right

2449
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:05,920
okay so that's why i didn't recognize it

2450
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,119
when i was reading it quickly if it's

2451
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,080
tag one then that's

2452
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:11,199
it i i just didn't see that one

2453
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,199
actually to be honest the sheboy also

2454
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:14,320
stumbled on this

2455
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,159
to me it's unintuitive there was a

2456
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:17,360
reason for this

2457
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:20,719
back in the days i don't know yeah

2458
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:23,840
right so yeah if uh if that's time

2459
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,239
if integer time is tag one then we're

2460
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,679
good yeah

2461
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:30,719
yeah it is okay

2462
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,080
so that was the second item um let me

2463
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,199
read quickly

2464
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:38,320
uh this is covert uh

2465
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:42,159
okay so i missed how that got covered

2466
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:45,040
uh there are now i think a lot of this

2467
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:45,840
isn't dave's

2468
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,280
stuff here i think um

2469
01:38:51,040 --> 01:38:53,760
it's it's close to the x path i think i

2470
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,320
wrongly know

2471
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,480
yeah my top line concern there was just

2472
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,239
that the field names looked different

2473
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,600
not that there was anything wrong with

2474
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,040
those field names and we either

2475
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,679
fix the field names to be the same or we

2476
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:06,880
call out to say

2477
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,239
you know the mapping is a little

2478
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:13,119
different

2479
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:16,639
here you can see it there's explicit

2480
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,440
uh text about process name for example

2481
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:20,560
edit here at the end

2482
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,880
this is maps2 and we even have an x-path

2483
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,600
expression

2484
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,000
that tells exactly what it maps to we

2485
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,600
address that with every

2486
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:30,880
place where that happens so you're

2487
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,000
pointing to something and i can't see it

2488
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,280
oh i'm not sharing anymore no you are

2489
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,639
sharing but uh

2490
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:44,320
here can you see my i haven't updated in

2491
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,920
a while though

2492
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,560
oh yeah maybe i don't see it because i'm

2493
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,119
looking at

2494
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:51,440
version scheme right now that is not the

2495
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,199
thing you want to look at sorry i will

2496
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:54,159
share

2497
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:56,000
please i'm so sorry i was not aware

2498
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,760
thank you for highlighting uh and now

2499
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:58,960
you can see my highlighting

2500
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,639
i hope is that better

2501
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:06,719
no oh it looks like it's frozen

2502
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,960
okay then i will simply stop sharing

2503
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,119
entirely swoosh

2504
01:40:11,119 --> 01:40:14,639
did it stop for you yes good then i will

2505
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:16,000
reshare

2506
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,920
let's see if this works and

2507
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:24,159
how does that look like uh

2508
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:26,000
it looks good because but you're sharing

2509
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,440
the screen so

2510
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,280
can you share the window so i can read

2511
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:32,159
it well there it is

2512
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:36,080
it's line eight and five eight

2513
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,760
and there could see at the end that we

2514
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:40,159
always added something this snaps to

2515
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,000
so this is our process name it's an

2516
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,679
example here on this side

2517
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:46,480
and this maps to the actual uh x path

2518
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:47,920
expression in this bit

2519
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,600
of xml sure so very thorough

2520
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,520
yeah check i i didn't notice that okay

2521
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,080
that's good

2522
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:04,080
so yeah we moved the file entry stuff uh

2523
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,000
there was another request actually outs

2524
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:06,480
or

2525
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:09,119
the world that it's confusing how we

2526
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:10,719
ordered it

2527
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:13,760
we mimicked the order of the switch uh

2528
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:16,840
iso text but um that was apparently

2529
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,400
confusing

2530
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:22,559
let me look if i can find it here

2531
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,760
no that was not covered here dang it so

2532
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:28,880
we moved

2533
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,440
everything about file hashes into a

2534
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,119
single section

2535
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:36,560
now and you were asking about uh

2536
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,400
does fire entry have a hash entry but

2537
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,760
does that yeah so

2538
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,880
it's the other way around sorry i'm not

2539
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,040
getting this right uh yes in switch

2540
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,159
there is the option to attach a file

2541
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:48,080
hash to the any attribute of

2542
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,360
every file uh actually the switch

2543
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,280
specification itself uses the any

2544
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,159
attribute

2545
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:55,760
uh the code with sophistication is more

2546
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,000
specific here but the option exists

2547
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,239
there it's just probably why i didn't

2548
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,600
catch it i mean because if that's in

2549
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:03,600
any i didn't read the switch spec clear

2550
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,040
enough i probably just went to the file

2551
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,719
edge and just said i didn't see hash and

2552
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:07,600
didn't realize anything

2553
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:10,960
yeah yeah yeah it's it's covered in

2554
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:13,280
english text and says use any and put

2555
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,400
this there and it's like

2556
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,280
okay um yeah we made this more extra set

2557
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,760
path elements um

2558
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,880
uh uh there is the path elements is just

2559
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:23,199
a

2560
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:25,520
uh a helper structure i can maybe it

2561
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,760
could go back to this

2562
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:31,280
full thingy here and now

2563
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,719
here search for path

2564
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,719
elements so that's that that's a huge

2565
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:39,920
that's a group

2566
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:44,159
path elements i see it i see it in below

2567
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,360
okay this is basically a uh we

2568
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,280
created that one because it used in two

2569
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:50,960
places yeah yeah and

2570
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:52,639
that's only because it's just here and

2571
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,800
there and that's just a which if we save

2572
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,960
one line of text actually so but

2573
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,400
but it's there the redundancy is removed

2574
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,600
i see it thanks that's helpful okay so

2575
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:04,960
that was done

2576
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,719
but that's just an explanation of things

2577
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,719
that have been done for a long time

2578
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:12,080
sam bear i think uh we we

2579
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,119
we uh um fixed the

2580
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:18,239
ref for some bear it's an

2581
01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:20,719
actual uh it's an actual reference now

2582
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,000
here as you can see

2583
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,920
it's not only a uh i don't know what it

2584
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,920
was before but now it's in real

2585
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:28,960
full-blown reference no but i think

2586
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,119
but i think the issue is that that

2587
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:32,480
reference

2588
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:34,080
maybe i mean again maybe i'm looking at

2589
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,520
the wrong version that

2590
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:38,719
references that website and that website

2591
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:40,400
is not going to fly as a normative

2592
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,520
reference

2593
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:45,280
so my advice was that

2594
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:47,199
instead of referencing that website and

2595
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:48,800
i know that's the best reference

2596
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,679
we instead say we're doing what's in the

2597
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:52,239
iso

2598
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,080
spec which will be a perfectly fine

2599
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,080
normative reference and the iso spec if

2600
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,000
i'm not mistaken actually references

2601
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,480
this website inside yes but that way you

2602
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,159
get around the issue of

2603
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:04,080
you not having a good normative

2604
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:05,199
reference

2605
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:07,679
here okay then we misunderstood the

2606
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:08,400
issue i guess

2607
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,400
so because it said if this is used in

2608
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:12,159
swift then that would be compelling

2609
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,440
argument to waiver it

2610
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,239
so maybe the waiver it was not clear

2611
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:17,440
what what actually is

2612
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,880
favored yeah um so

2613
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,320
yeah i i have no strong feelings here

2614
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,040
referencing these iso spec and saying

2615
01:44:27,040 --> 01:44:28,080
we're doing

2616
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:30,800
it the same way as in uh not using

2617
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,000
somewhere but

2618
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,119
this year suite is fine with me uh it's

2619
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:36,000
a minor change

2620
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,040
text yeah that was in the dash 15

2621
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,040
i talked a little bit about how other

2622
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,880
folks would ballot on that document

2623
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,440
and there's a desire to point to

2624
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,719
something tighter

2625
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:49,119
and if you do the if you do the

2626
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:51,360
reference where if we list the iso

2627
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:53,040
reference that will make it an okay

2628
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:54,400
reference and if someone really wants to

2629
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:55,679
get the details through the iso

2630
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:56,800
reference you'll be able to click

2631
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,199
through

2632
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:59,119
that link that you already have so we'll

2633
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:00,960
cover it as kind of an administrative

2634
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:02,480
thing in that way

2635
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,320
okay so so basically what we're doing

2636
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,600
here is uh

2637
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,080
c uh switch would basically it's not

2638
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,119
same there but we would

2639
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,440
say c suite here and maybe a little bit

2640
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,960
more text above here okay

2641
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,960
yeah that's a no-brainer of course i

2642
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,880
mean there's no reason why you can't

2643
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,480
you know have an informative reference

2644
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,320
to semvair in the inline text that

2645
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,000
actually explain it but when we have to

2646
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,080
have a formal reference to explain

2647
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,239
that that particular iana registry we

2648
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:28,639
use the iso spec instead

2649
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:30,080
understood so this is the first open

2650
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:33,119
review thank you um

2651
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,560
no the second one is because we're still

2652
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,320
gonna include new text

2653
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:40,239
at the top for the versioning right

2654
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:43,280
oh yeah thank you bill um just us

2655
01:45:43,280 --> 01:45:45,840
asking uh did you capture these two uh

2656
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:48,320
actions

2657
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,239
otherwise i will make a note now

2658
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,360
what i have in the notes is that the

2659
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,040
reference is a website and the website's

2660
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:00,800
not a normative reference the normative

2661
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,679
references

2662
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,840
should be to the iso switch spec and the

2663
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,920
iso switch spec includes december

2664
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:07,360
reference

2665
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:11,119
okay cool could you uh um um at like an

2666
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:14,239
action summary like action on sibo

2667
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,159
attack for next version

2668
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:20,639
and or uh um the assembler item so like

2669
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:22,560
they have a small action item list here

2670
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,840
in the minutes it says fine with you

2671
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:28,000
here super cool thanks

2672
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,080
and thanks roman for reminding me about

2673
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,520
the sibo attack

2674
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,960
which i probably would not have

2675
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,440
forgotten

2676
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,239
so yeah i can't i

2677
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:43,840
never never know now so um next item

2678
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,560
uh what are the normative requirements

2679
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,520
yeah uh there

2680
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,960
are a lot of normative requirements now

2681
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,639
and you are asking is there something in

2682
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:54,239
swift preventing normal guidance that

2683
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:55,199
says should

2684
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,000
or must sign

2685
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:01,440
um

2686
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:05,679
right so i appreciate the new section i

2687
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:06,880
appreciate the new kind of section

2688
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,719
describing how to precisely do the

2689
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:10,159
signing in coast with so

2690
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:13,520
so there's an analog to xml kind of sig

2691
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:15,440
in kind of swift that's great now the

2692
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,840
question is you've given the blob of how

2693
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,960
to do it right

2694
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,600
but what's the operational workflow

2695
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,000
about

2696
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,560
when it should be applied and is there

2697
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,880
something some parallel we need to apply

2698
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,960
from suit or is there something new we

2699
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,840
should say here about that

2700
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:34,480
no actually uh suit is as ambiguous as

2701
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,199
we are

2702
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,960
so what you're basically saying how you

2703
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:39,040
do it and you're not with a single

2704
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:41,199
word mentioning that you must do it or

2705
01:47:41,199 --> 01:47:42,880
recommend when to do it

2706
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:45,280
uh that is due to the nature of switz

2707
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,080
for example

2708
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:48,480
if you create an evidence switch tag on

2709
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:49,360
your system

2710
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,960
it's basically like a claim set for uh

2711
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,119
for attestation evidence because you are

2712
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:57,040
creating all the hash values for the

2713
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,119
files that are running right now

2714
01:47:59,119 --> 01:48:02,960
so um and the uh oh they were executed

2715
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:03,760
right

2716
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,280
at some point and are running right now

2717
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,880
so they think that's better phrased

2718
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,679
so so that is a suit that you can create

2719
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:10,320
ad hoc

2720
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,480
on a for example a target environment

2721
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:13,520
and rats

2722
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,440
for for clips and that would be super

2723
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:18,000
fine and that is not signed by itself

2724
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,840
the the the testing environment will

2725
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:21,600
sign all the whole other things you

2726
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:23,920
you bang it in there so that it probably

2727
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:25,679
would use an unsigned switch with an

2728
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:26,719
evidence tag

2729
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:29,600
that is signed by a uh let's call it uh

2730
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,239
um

2731
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:33,119
authorized uh entity on on the on the

2732
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:34,239
producer side

2733
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:37,600
so um so that is why we are we have no

2734
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,920
text in here when to sign because the

2735
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,760
document cannot know

2736
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,000
when you sign stuff it's it's the

2737
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,800
application

2738
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,119
usage scenario that basically tells you

2739
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:48,800
if you want to sign something or not

2740
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,199
this is just the format and how to do it

2741
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,440
right that makes sense i think what we

2742
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:54,719
could benefit from

2743
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:56,639
is a sentence in the security

2744
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:58,800
consideration that says something on the

2745
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,239
order of

2746
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:02,639
this document only provides a data

2747
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:03,600
format

2748
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,280
uh any application that adopts

2749
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:10,320
it will need to strongly consider

2750
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,920
you know its operational environment and

2751
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:13,679
the security constraints you know that

2752
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:14,880
it operates under

2753
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,360
you know the primitives to do integrity

2754
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,560
are here

2755
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:20,320
so we want to distinguish and say

2756
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,320
defining the operational scope and some

2757
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,760
of the security considerations

2758
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:25,520
are out of scope of this document

2759
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,520
because we're we're only strictly

2760
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:28,800
defining a data

2761
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,800
an agnostic and environment agnostic

2762
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,440
data format

2763
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,840
sounds fair i think that is a sentence

2764
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,599
that we can drop in the security

2765
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:38,560
requirements yeah

2766
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,400
there's nothing i could say against that

2767
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,800
it is a very put requirement we will do

2768
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:44,960
that

2769
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:49,760
okay got it um so we are now

2770
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,560
we have 10 minutes left and one two

2771
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:53,599
three

2772
01:49:53,599 --> 01:49:56,560
four five items with our rate not

2773
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,679
necessarily

2774
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:00,880
enough time so um let me check your

2775
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:04,080
next item please

2776
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:12,400
oh that's basically the same

2777
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,360
item we could would do that uh that

2778
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:17,119
notion of how to uh

2779
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:19,119
how secure the provisional validation

2780
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:21,119
logic and how to make the trustworthy

2781
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:22,880
into the security

2782
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:24,960
requirements right yeah that's right i

2783
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,719
mean i think just we need some logic to

2784
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:27,199
say

2785
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:29,840
it's a difficult problem to talk about

2786
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,440
trust anchors and how you get them

2787
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,880
you need to do that that's an

2788
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,880
application specific thing probably done

2789
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:36,719
with yeah

2790
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:39,840
maybe false collapses with the previous

2791
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:41,760
item because i think it's actually in

2792
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:43,360
the same scope of the and thank you for

2793
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,320
that of the

2794
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:47,040
uh security considerations okay moving

2795
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,440
on

2796
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:50,879
um to

2797
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,040
this item here swoosh

2798
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:58,480
and your newest comment is

2799
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,119
um

2800
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:10,639
yes we can explain what integrity means

2801
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:13,280
or integrity protection in this case um

2802
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,320
do you really

2803
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:18,080
think that is necessary well

2804
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:21,280
so what struck me is

2805
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,280
the gestalt here is that we just have a

2806
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,560
data format

2807
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,480
and all of the application

2808
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:28,239
considerations are out of scope

2809
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:29,599
but then later in the security

2810
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:31,679
considerations text we actually talk

2811
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:34,080
about the behavior of the applications

2812
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,960
and how they can use that data so if we

2813
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,400
are going to go through the trouble of

2814
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,520
talking about

2815
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,760
how applications will process it i do

2816
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,599
think we need to say the very explicit

2817
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:44,400
thing which is

2818
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,880
if you don't have intel you know we need

2819
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,000
to say something on the order

2820
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,920
of what what i have there because we're

2821
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,719
talking about the application behavior

2822
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:54,080
i mean it's a choice either we talk

2823
01:51:54,080 --> 01:51:56,080
about it and it's in scope uh

2824
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,840
or it's out of scope but if we start

2825
01:51:57,840 --> 01:51:59,199
talking about it i think we need to go

2826
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,320
down

2827
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,480
instead of it being a self-contained a

2828
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:05,678
self-contained blob of text

2829
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:08,800
okay thank you i think that's valid uh

2830
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,719
if you open that can of worms you kind

2831
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:11,520
of have to

2832
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,239
deal with the consequences correct

2833
01:52:14,239 --> 01:52:15,040
that's right yeah

2834
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,320
yeah yeah i get it um yeah

2835
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,840
it was hard to follow but i think your

2836
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,760
reasoning i thank you for the for the

2837
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:25,040
uh connotation uh really helps

2838
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,920
um this will go not to the

2839
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,760
considerations but to this section

2840
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:30,800
actually i think

2841
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:34,000
that's better placed there

2842
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,280
okay but this speed we can actually make

2843
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:39,599
it through

2844
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:41,599
the next item i have to look at sorry

2845
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:45,840
for the moment here

2846
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,800
so this is a semantic play on i i

2847
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,159
understand the definition

2848
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:51,760
that you've created this word called

2849
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,280
authoritative codes

2850
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,440
co swit tags which is meant to say the

2851
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:56,400
place that

2852
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:59,280
created them is the authoritative place

2853
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:00,960
but again this is back to the previous

2854
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:02,480
thing which is to comment to say

2855
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,080
you can call it authoritative which

2856
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:06,080
makes it seem like that's the place you

2857
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:06,800
get it for

2858
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,560
but if you didn't sign it there's no way

2859
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:10,159
of knowing whether it's authoritative or

2860
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:11,280
not

2861
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,880
because i can modify it at will

2862
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,920
so this again collapses with ah that's

2863
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,840
a there's a top there's a semantic

2864
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,760
discrepancy between the two items

2865
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:29,679
okay yeah i will i don't have an easy

2866
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:31,679
fix for that i see the problem

2867
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:34,159
um i think there isn't there does not

2868
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:35,199
need many words

2869
01:53:35,199 --> 01:53:37,920
but uh i think we have to place it well

2870
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:40,159
i think that's the actual challenge here

2871
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:43,440
where to place the the words

2872
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:47,040
okay uh yeah i can't i can't provide a

2873
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:47,679
uh

2874
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:51,360
answer right now i we will but that's a

2875
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,760
really open issue then and uh that's the

2876
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,599
first okay i'm

2877
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,159
not worried still and there's a net

2878
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:00,239
which we can cover then and then there

2879
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:01,280
is

2880
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,080
yeah pub key is my fault i'm i'm i this

2881
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:04,480
is

2882
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:08,080
force of habit i apologize

2883
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,679
straightforward that's an easy it's an

2884
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,440
easy yeah

2885
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:14,320
and the final item is implement and the

2886
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,040
use

2887
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,159
of sign tags whose signature is verified

2888
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,000
to use too

2889
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,360
so the the challenges of uh

2890
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,199
some of the challenges were were kind of

2891
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:26,800
laid out in that last paragraph and all

2892
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,000
i'm saying there is that

2893
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,599
in addition to input standardization

2894
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:31,040
loop detection

2895
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,800
actually adding signatures might help us

2896
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,400
in mitigation as well so it's just

2897
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,639
input sanitization comma loop detection

2898
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:37,920
comma signed

2899
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,679
side tags is a way to address these

2900
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:40,960
concerns

2901
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:43,520
ah okay yeah then we can we can yeah

2902
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:44,639
okay then i can uh

2903
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:46,880
this is a place where maybe even address

2904
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:49,199
then section six problem here

2905
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:51,360
okay yeah i see the the okay that's an

2906
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:53,440
easy that is almost a nits okay uh i

2907
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:54,800
will do this

2908
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,239
and uh sounds actually doable

2909
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,880
maybe we will be done with this earlier

2910
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,840
than april

2911
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:06,239
wonderful and thank you for making this

2912
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:06,719
happen

2913
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:09,040
because i think this 45 minutes really

2914
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:09,760
did the trick

2915
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:15,040
i think uh that helped a lot excellent

2916
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,239
all right is there anything we think we

2917
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:19,280
need to still talk about with that

2918
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,199
document

2919
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:24,239
because i think we're really close

2920
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,880
hello is there anything else we think we

2921
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,560
need to talk about did you lose my audio

2922
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:33,360
or something

2923
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,440
no no no you're there i was i was

2924
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:36,880
wondering if hank was going to say

2925
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,480
something but it seems to me that

2926
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:41,520
we're at a good place to uh okay say say

2927
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:42,320
goodbye

2928
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:46,080
and give everybody five minutes

2929
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,679

2930
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,360
so bad

2931
