i'm sorry for this

188
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,640
delay to start the decision so we

189
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
just right after the the first session

190
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,080
we had last last time we um

191
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,720
we we tried to to capitalize on the i

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,600
would say on the

193
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
on the comment that we received so far

194
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
and the the various comments we received

195
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
during the decision and also

196
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
the some of the consideration we have

197
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,600
ordered the draft

198
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
and we would like to um to make a

199
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
proposal so that we can we can make some

200
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,560
progress for the um

201
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,200
yeah for the for for the specification

202
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
of course this

203
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
this proposal does not mean that all

204
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,360
will be will be frozen

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,440
but at least we will have something we

206
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
we would like at the

207
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,080
end of the meeting to to have i would

208
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,160
say a base so that so that we can we can

209
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,839
we can adjust on the future

210
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,839
but at least the sum of the key feature

211
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,760
can be can be covered so

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,920
the the memphis portal will be will be

213
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
structured um as shown

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,880
in this slide so we we the first

215
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
key consideration that we heard they

216
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
would say at least for the um

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
the last meeting is that yeah if we if

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
if dnsec

219
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
is supported by the client and we have

220
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,600
the record that are signed at the uh at

221
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,959
the server side

222
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,200
so the information that will be i would

223
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,120
say sufficient so for the um

224
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,279
for the for the client to uh to discover

225
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,640
the the resolvers

226
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
will be the idiot itself and a list of

227
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
ip addresses

228
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,440
uh and then once this information is

229
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,120
supplied to the client the client can

230
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,240
use the svc bqs to resolve the

231
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,399
i would say the the domain name and this

232
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,560
information will be sent to the api that

233
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,440
is provided in this information but the

234
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
as we all know that dns sec is not that

235
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,959
supported by some of the clients and

236
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,640
we we may also have they would say

237
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,079
design which is not signed

238
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,560
so we have the the the uh the next step

239
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,360
is that

240
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,920
uh if the nsx is not supported so uh

241
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,839
what what are the uh the key information

242
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,279
that will be required by the

243
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,760
medic client so that it can securely

244
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
retrieve the information that would be

245
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,000
needed for

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
for um for for the process so in

247
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,760
addition to

248
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
uh the edn the the name information that

249
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,120
is already uh the

250
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,040
uh present in the in the previous step

251
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,680
and also the um the list of ip addresses

252
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
we will need an ultimate port number

253
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
because um we for instance for dns

254
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,560
or tls or even for for quick we may not

255
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
have the same port number used for uh

256
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,600
for i would say

257
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,680
binding the service and in addition to

258
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,839
that we'll also need to uh to convey

259
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,240
to in the dhap option the information

260
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
about the type of the encrypted dns

261
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,760
which is supported by

262
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,079
by the server this one is is needed in

263
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,160
order to avoid having the problem to

264
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,920
to go through all the variant of the

265
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,760
integrated dns services that are

266
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
supported by the client

267
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,959
so all this from this this for

268
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,279
information can be uh at least required

269
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,959
to be returned in the

270
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,600
shape option and then once we have this

271
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,560
formation the

272
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
the client if it support dns over

273
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,320
or over tls or if it support also dns

274
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,279
over quick

275
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,959
and in addition to that it supports also

276
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,959
the damage over https

277
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
in in that case the we the client will

278
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,120
establish a secure connection

279
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
using the information that is provided

280
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,240
in this previous step

281
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
so that to to uh to retrieve the list of

282
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
the ui templates from the

283
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
from the server but if the the client

284
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
is only supporting the uh uh

285
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,160
in in that case the client must request

286
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,399
a list of era templates from the from

287
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,240
the from the dhcp server

288
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
uh this is this is important to avoid

289
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
having the external attacks against the

290
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
um um the svcp carriers and also the

291
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,279
if in case the the the request the svcp

292
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,839
requests are get blocked somewhere so

293
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:10,800
this is basically

294
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
i would say the um the uh the overall

295
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,240
sketch of the proposal that we would

296
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,800
like

297
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
uh to propose for the for the working

298
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,480
group uh of course the

299
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,160
we we may consider some some

300
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,519
simplifications and

301
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,279
uh as shown in the next slide

302
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,120
well let's uh sit here for a second

303
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,560
we've got some confusion going on in

304
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
chat and people that want to

305
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,079
uh jump in with couple questions so

306
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,199
tommy paulie please first

307
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,120
all right uh yeah thank you for updating

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,160
the proposals i

309
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,360
i like like the first half i'm not it

310
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,959
sounds like you know this is kind of a

311
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,040
hybrid in which we have the stuff we

312
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,160
were talking about tuesday and the stuff

313
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,720
that was

314
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,920
existing um and that's being conditional

315
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,720
on dns

316
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,760
can you explain a bit more why

317
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,040
i don't recall why dnsec should matter

318
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,560
here really because

319
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,320
if we have the name um

320
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,240
then we can

321
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
do a secure upgrade the only

322
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
attack that i can think of is that

323
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
someone could do a denial of service

324
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,519
but that already is possible someone

325
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,880
could just block your communication

326
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
yeah i think this point particularly

327
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
tommy was discussed on the mailing list

328
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,839
and the clarification was already given

329
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,040
there is that you

330
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,160
for instance if you can if the nsx is

331
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,320
not supported then someone can return to

332
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,639
you

333
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,199
i would say some queries and then it can

334
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,160
directly to

335
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,160
another fake server which is claiming to

336
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,040
i would say on the name and so on so

337
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,880
but but i guess in that case so i i have

338
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,920
if i have the name from

339
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
dhcp and if i'm on a network where i'm

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,279
trusting dhcp

341
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,480
more than dns because i have dhcp guard

342
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
or something like that

343
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,120
then unless this name that the network

344
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,320
is giving out is fundamentally

345
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
compromised so let's say it's

346
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,120
cloudflare dns or it's your uh xfinity

347
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
dns or something if that

348
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,839
is that if people if rogue dns servers

349
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
have valid certificates for that

350
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
then people are going to have a bad time

351
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,000
connecting to that dns server

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,680
in general um but assuming that that is

353
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,480
valid and people are when they're using

354
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:30,800
the

355
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,399
svcp record results they're using the

356
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,880
the name

357
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,639
hello yeah tommy you're right that if

358
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,320
dhcp gives you an adm

359
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,240
tls certificate validation would happen

360
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,480
and there is no possibility of an attack

361
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,399
but the attack that we discussed in the

362
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,880
last minute of yesterday's meeting was

363
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,440
a scenario where the dns response is

364
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
modified in a way to show that there is

365
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,680
a dohd or dioco server

366
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
but the parameters are set in a way that

367
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
the client doesn't connect to it it's

368
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,040
basically spoofing attack

369
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,360
but it says the servers are available

370
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,240
and the client

371
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,920
tries to connect to that maybe it picks

372
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
some parameters which

373
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
the client doesn't support or it takes

374
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
any other let's say it talks about some

375
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,240
protocol that

376
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,760
the client does not support and it

377
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,519
becomes a denial of service the denial

378
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,680
of service is not because i think that

379
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,399
that reduces down detail of service

380
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,839
right because there are many ways to

381
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,199
deny the service you can block yeah

382
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,120
better than this you can

383
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
modify it to be incorrect or more easily

384
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
and what you are still vulnerable to

385
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
no matter what you put in dhcp someone

386
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,680
can just block your communication

387
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,959
to that so so we

388
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,560
so there are multiple types of denial of

389
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,320
service we are just talking about

390
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,399
an attack of denial of service where you

391
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,079
get tampered responses

392
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,759
and the client thinks the server is

393
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
available it's supporting the uh but

394
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,360
it's still not able to connect and it

395
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
just gives up and falls back to do 53

396
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,120
but in case if there is a denial of

397
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,360
service where somebody's blocking it the

398
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
client would be sure that hey

399
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,639
there is an attacker which is blocking

400
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,240
it but in this case the client would be

401
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,800
thinking

402
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,560
hey maybe it's the server is upgraded

403
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,160
it's using some latest version that i

404
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,959
don't have

405
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,040
and i'm falling back so there's a

406
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
difference between the two attacks that

407
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
uh uh uh uh you can see that

408
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,720
in one case the client has no knowledge

409
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
uh why it was blocked

410
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,880
from assets if i received

411
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
this scenario that you're describing in

412
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
which i received

413
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,639
indication that i support encrypted dns

414
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,680
with a name

415
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,440
i looked up the record and i failed to

416
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
connect i would treat that as an

417
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,639
attacker and i think we would need to

418
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,160
let the user know

419
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
um i don't think there's any reason to

420
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,519
have a client assume that

421
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
oh they just have an old version i think

422
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,839
that should look like an attack

423
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,880
and we should mandate that anyway i'll

424
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,000
let thank you tommy

425
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
um ecker please

426
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
thank you so i think like maybe like

427
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,720
let's just take a step back here

428
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,959
um and make sure we all agree on the

429
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,399
basic assumptions

430
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,720
the first biggest assumption is whatever

431
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,439
stuff you got

432
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,880
in this um you know in in in this

433
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,439
message

434
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
is authentic correct

435
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,319
yes yep okay good

436
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,919
and that whatever you get over

437
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
dns is not authentic unless it is

438
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,520
authenticated via either

439
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,120
dnsec or tls correct

440
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,679
right okay good um

441
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:38,080
and um so

442
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,280
and the server has no way knowing the

443
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,720
client's capabilities

444
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,880
but the client but the server knows it

445
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
it's correct

446
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
so when you say if dnsec is not support

447
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,520
is supported by the client or dsa is not

448
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,880
supported by client i don't understand

449
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
what that means

450
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,160
yeah this is the behavior from the

451
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,480
client standpoint

452
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,240
i i understand but my point is the

453
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
server has to provide the client

454
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,280
something it can accept

455
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,240
yeah that's it this is something that

456
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,960
we'll discuss

457
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
on the next slide to see how um because

458
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,799
the um

459
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,400
as a function of the capabilities of the

460
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,200
client the this this will trigger

461
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,640
i would say the um some of the

462
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,160
information that will be requested by

463
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,600
the client itself

464
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
to the server and also how it will

465
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
handle some of the information that we

466
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,600
receive from the

467
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
from the server the server does not need

468
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,200
to to be aware of the capabilities of

469
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
the client itself

470
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
right what i'm saying is rather than

471
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
having two versions have one

472
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
have the one that works when the client

473
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
does not support dns sec

474
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,120
yep so like i don't understand i don't i

475
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,080
don't understand why i'm making the

476
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,880
switch statement here like the like

477
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,760
the um as i understand this point the

478
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
security properties

479
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,679
do you believe the security properties

480
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,679
of these two arms of this slide

481
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,039
deanth is supported by the client or

482
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,640
insect is not supported by a client are

483
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,039
the same

484
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,559
yes then i don't yes and i don't

485
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,760
understand why

486
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,520
we need to have both arms like let's

487
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,120
just have the second arm

488
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,840
um and uh um

489
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,280
yeah so i think if you go over the dns

490
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,600
sec

491
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,240
is not supported then uh dnsec is

492
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
supported just becomes a sub case but we

493
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,360
just wanted to cover

494
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,480
why uh why the difference is required in

495
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,160
case of dns occasionally not required we

496
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,679
can just go with this case but

497
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,440
it was just to illustrate the purpose

498
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,799
why uh

499
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,000
uh the svcb query was not sufficient and

500
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,960
you had to

501
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,559
rely on something else because of

502
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,919
clients which were not doing that but

503
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,679
the proposal could be just sticking to

504
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,799
the later ones without sure so this this

505
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,080
brings me to a final point

506
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,480
which is what we are now doing is adding

507
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,799
like tiny little pieces of svcb

508
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
into this into this message to get to

509
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,480
the point where we're satisfied

510
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,559
and bringing back to my point yesterday

511
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,840
let us add all of that

512
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,360
svcp here and they really didn't know

513
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,880
analysis whatsoever determine what

514
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,080
pieces of svcb

515
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,159
we have to manage and we will not have

516
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,360
to do the thing we want to do the next

517
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,640
slide which is required dot

518
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
and all we'll have to do is import svcb

519
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
so instead of trying to do like a bunch

520
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,039
of

521
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,120
like when we first agreed to accept this

522
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,799
set this work

523
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,600
um i said and i believe the number said

524
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,280
let us not create a situation we have a

525
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,000
a

526
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,919
disjoint set of information or an

527
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,280
overlapping set of information which is

528
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,679
in this

529
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,000
record and which is svcb the original

530
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
puzzle was designed to have exactly one

531
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,720
thing

532
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,280
which was the adn so it was like easy to

533
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
analyze but now what you're doing is

534
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,360
you're creating a whole pile of new

535
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,720
stuff which we have to analyze i mean

536
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
much easier or simply to say svcb and

537
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,440
then we don't think about the problem at

538
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,170
all

539
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,200
[Music]

540
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,320
yes thank you ecker i do i'm sorry sorry

541
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,360
i do want to i want to say one more

542
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,960
thing and if and if the problem is for

543
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,640
some reason it's too big put a digestive

544
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,440
svcb

545
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,400
no i'm done okay excellent eric and

546
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,559
anterio and med i i hope you will

547
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,039
uh very much take those uh comments into

548
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,000
consideration

549
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,360
and now uh ralph weber

550
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
yeah though please think the initial

551
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
draft was very simple in the way that it

552
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,480
had kind of the ip address and then a

553
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
bitmap and then you connect it and be

554
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,039
done

555
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,320
and uh i agree that

556
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
dhcp should be that should be like that

557
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,679
you get the information

558
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,440
and you can with that information make

559
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,760
a connection to a dns server what we are

560
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,640
now

561
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,240
doing is kind of like creating a

562
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
circular dependency and i

563
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
agree the i mean if we are want to go

564
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,320
down the svcp record

565
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,200
just stick the record in the dhcp packet

566
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
and be done

567
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,960
i mean why are these additional steps

568
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,600
needed

569
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
that's something i don't understand

570
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,679
thanks

571
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,840
thank you ralph ben schwartz please

572
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,880
uh so to me the the core

573
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
sticky question here that that we need

574
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,240
to address

575
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,320
is what happens if you are a doe

576
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,679
only client and your

577
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,720
network hands you a resolver that says

578
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,039
and says this resolver supports

579
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,880
encrypted dns

580
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
and you you chase the information about

581
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,520
that resolver and find

582
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,960
that it only does dns over tls

583
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,400
uh or any other combination of protocols

584
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,120
you're a dot only client and the network

585
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,000
hands you an encrypted

586
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
resolver that appears to only support

587
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
doh

588
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
um there's there are various options

589
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,200
there

590
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,559
um you know the obvious options

591
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,640
are to fail open or fail closed

592
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,080
um and they're both bad uh they both

593
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,320
they both create some either secure

594
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,000
serious security or operational

595
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,520
challenges note that we're talking about

596
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,480
dhcp

597
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,919
there's no negotiation here between the

598
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:54,880
the

599
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,080
client and the dhcp server

600
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,360
really um the dhcp server is just

601
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,320
informing the client

602
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,840
so uh i think that to me is the is the

603
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,200
core thing that we

604
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,320
we want to resolve here

605
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,199
thank you ben becker

606
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,039
um i think i think there's perhaps

607
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,120
i want to i think by agreeable thanks

608
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
for that thanks for uh

609
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,919
uh sharpening that so much i'll let you

610
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,440
start a tiny bit more

611
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,080
which is that there are two questions

612
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,440
one question is you have the information

613
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,320
authentically another

614
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,280
question you got that information

615
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,840
authentically and the uh attack you

616
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,280
propose on the mailing list involves

617
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,039
having the information not authentically

618
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,919
but if you have information

619
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,679
authentically i think i actually don't

620
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,159
agree

621
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,559
with tommy which is um if i join a

622
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,320
network and um

623
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,120
and i only speak doe and network says

624
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,000
well i only i only

625
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
have doke that's like oh well that was

626
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,679
kind of sad um you know

627
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,600
but i mean but um and i just go ahead

628
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,720
but i mean the the

629
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,679
the point of this mechanism is um i mean

630
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:00,320
the

631
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,720
the point of this mechanism after all um

632
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,760
is to allow you to discover that

633
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,559
networks do have

634
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,080
upgraded security and take advantage of

635
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
that and um

636
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,080
and so uh you know if if we were willing

637
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,919
to if we were willing to have the

638
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
assumption that the client would

639
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,840
actually refuse to connect an armored

640
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
secure resolver actually it's probably

641
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,440
much much simpler right um

642
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,120
because then you wouldn't have to trust

643
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,880
me this information at all um

644
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,000
so um so i think that the you know uh

645
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,200
so i think my understanding is

646
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
assumption is the client wants to i

647
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,000
don't want to say opportunistic that's

648
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
not quite right but the client wants to

649
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,440
discover if the network supports secure

650
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,679
resolver and then use it um but also not

651
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,039
use it if it does not have one

652
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,200
so um so i think if the information is

653
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,440
authentic the answer is actually um i'm

654
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
not sure if you want to call fel open

655
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,840
but it's a continuous 53.

656
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,000
thank you ecker ben is back please

657
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
so uh i i am perfectly okay with that i

658
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,320
just want to be clear about

659
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,640
the what the result of that is um the

660
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,320
result of that

661
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
in this design is that um is is

662
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,400
essentially

663
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
what what muhammad has has put on the

664
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
slide

665
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,240
which is that um at a minimum

666
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,640
you you need um you need the dhcp server

667
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,600
to enumerate

668
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,960
for you the the set of protocols

669
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,159
supported by the server so the client

670
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,880
cannot

671
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,480
insecurely discover that set of

672
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
protocols using only

673
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,919
the adn i concur and

674
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,840
and uh and i and i agree with eckerd

675
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,960
that if you're going to

676
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,919
include that kind of information then uh

677
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:38,799
you should probably

678
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,360
ship the whole configuration

679
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,600
thank you ben uh jim reid please

680
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,559
i'm getting a bit confused with this

681
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,240
discussion because i think we're diving

682
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,799
too much

683
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,279
in detail when things like the threat

684
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,880
model is really not clear and fully

685
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,080
understood

686
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,640
um i mean what are the risks here about

687
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,880
using dna where are the requirements

688
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
um maybe we need to step back a little

689
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,240
bit even further from what echad

690
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,039
mentioned

691
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,159
a few minutes ago what is it this

692
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,000
this particular proposal is trying to

693
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,919
solve from a threat perspective

694
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,720
thank you jim um

695
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
glenn did you have something you were

696
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,799
going to say

697
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,600
yeah so not wearing a hat here i just

698
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,320
want to point out

699
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,679
that you know the device of this dhcp

700
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,960
server we're talking about right now

701
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,000
will be an older

702
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,120
legacy cp device in most cases

703
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,400
so it just strikes me as we should i

704
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,799
think

705
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,320
always keep in mind that we need to keep

706
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
that portion of the

707
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,200
things simple and you know i'm getting

708
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,320
these things upgraded

709
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,760
is going to be very difficult it has

710
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,840
always proven to be very difficult so

711
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
keeping what behavior we expect from the

712
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,679
dhcp server

713
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,080
at a very simple level i think is is the

714
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,279
path of success here

715
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,679
not uh adding a lot of complexity onto

716
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,840
it

717
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,000
uh thank you glenn terry please

718
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,400
yeah i mean i i understand the proposal

719
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,480
of putting in the entire svcp dns

720
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,520
response in the

721
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,840
thcp option but what we realized was

722
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,760
when we started looking into the dhcp

723
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,320
options

724
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
uh uh the way the dhcp options were

725
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,919
supposed to be designed it's supposed to

726
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,279
be really simple

727
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,440
and if you're supposed to put the entire

728
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,399
svcp

729
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,799
uh recorder it seems to be deviating

730
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,840
from the

731
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,440
guidelines that were set with regard to

732
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,279
dhcp option set and uh

733
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,960
this needs to be definitely discussed in

734
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,039
a much larger form probably in other

735
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,840
working group

736
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
where dhcp options are being defined but

737
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
if if svg options were put we don't have

738
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
to do all of this and it's very

739
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,640
straightforward

740
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,279
but the concern why we put all of this

741
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
in in a format that would be acceptable

742
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,000
by the tcp working group was to keep it

743
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,120
as simple as possible and uh uh if svcp

744
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,640
record is the way to go and

745
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,919
uh if this working group and the dhc

746
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,919
working group has no issues i i think

747
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,520
that's the easiest way to get this done

748
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,000
thank you to tommy bali back

749
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
yeah i'd like to maybe kind of call on

750
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,440
eckhart to clarify

751
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,240
the the thing that was he said last time

752
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,080
and what he has in chat around

753
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,320
using the hash so would that essentially

754
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,480
just be

755
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,840
a hash of this so that we would query

756
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,960
the scp svcb records but we would be

757
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
able to detect

758
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,200
if someone is messing with them

759
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,840
so it's really just like a way to

760
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,480
validate

761
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,360
that to validate i'm not under attack

762
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,960
that sounds like an interesting

763
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,120
direction for this

764
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,880
yeah that sounds like a really simple

765
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,559
way of solving it and we could just give

766
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,440
the adn plus ip addresses plus the hash

767
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,440
so right and if you know the hash then

768
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,559
you can validate that you have the

769
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,679
correct set

770
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,880
of bonuses and then that's the limit

771
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,799
that you'll ever have

772
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,640
um of all the information you ever have

773
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,520
to put into ecp or any other protocol

774
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,559
right oh we cannot hear you echo yeah

775
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,760
ecker is

776
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,799
um oh jesus it doesn't say here just a

777
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,399
simple

778
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,240
that you're referring to paulie right

779
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,600
nothing to do with any secrets or

780
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,679
anything like that it's just simple

781
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,559
i assume sorry anyway once once echo can

782
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,679
speak well

783
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,679
yeah cool i i like the direction

784
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,520
for the moment while ecker hopefully

785
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,880
gets that sorted out

786
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,520
um could uh ben please comment

787
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,000
hi uh so i wanted to

788
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
first say in terms of simplicity

789
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,399
i think move okay in terms of management

790
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,960
i do not think shipping a hash of the

791
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
record or record set

792
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,080
is is really an option here um

793
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
these these things are dynamic so if the

794
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,200
client

795
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,159
does a lookup there is no particular

796
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,039
guarantee

797
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,200
that it gets the exact record set that

798
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
that was previously seen

799
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,640
by the dhcp server

800
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,320
so uh that you know you could easily get

801
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,799
mismatches that are are not due to any

802
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,840
kind of attack and

803
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
that would result in a in the client

804
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,720
essentially going offline

805
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,919
the um i do not think that shipping

806
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,440
these records creates a lot of

807
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,279
operational complexity

808
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,520
or implementation complexity because

809
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,640
they are opaque

810
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,000
to the to the dhcp server

811
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,600
um you know the dcp server uh

812
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,480
just basically needs the domain name and

813
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,919
it can fetch this record although

814
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,559
there's some

815
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,159
some security questions about the

816
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,880
bootstrap process there but

817
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,399
but it doesn't need to look inside the

818
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,559
record it just needs to

819
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,320
plop the record into this dhcp option

820
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,159
if the concern is really about record

821
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,440
size

822
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,679
i also think that we don't need to worry

823
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,679
too much about that

824
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,880
service b is tightly optimized for size

825
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,080
because dns records are also under

826
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,679
considerable size pressure so it's a

827
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,880
very efficient encoding

828
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,519
they so i floated an a suggestion on the

829
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,640
mailing list to ship

830
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,960
entire dns responses essentially

831
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,360
with multiple records in the standard

832
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,760
full dns wire format

833
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,840
one reason that i think that's relevant

834
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,200
is that we need to talk about ttls here

835
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,480
it's dhcp leases are typically

836
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,519
measured in in hours to days

837
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,840
but dns records can turn over much

838
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,640
faster

839
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,039
especially address records that are used

840
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,039
for load balancing

841
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,080
so if your entire if an entire large

842
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,279
subnet you know it could

843
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,200
thousands of of devices or even more

844
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,360
could be served by a single dhcp server

845
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,440
that's handing everybody a single

846
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,679
a fixed set of ip addresses for a dns

847
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,480
server

848
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,840
that is uh which they are then holding

849
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,720
on to

850
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
for uh for days

851
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,919
at a time that's going to interfere with

852
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:24,720
the ability

853
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,360
of typical cdn style load balancing

854
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,720
which is allowed

855
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,320
with service b so

856
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,080
so i think ttls are valuable here

857
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
although if necessary we can

858
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,919
say that you should shorten your dhcp

859
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,360
lease to compensate

860
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,760
that's not i suspect some people

861
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,880
wouldn't be so happy with that

862
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
um but but if we can omit the ttls then

863
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,519
we can also talk about an even more

864
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,080
compressed representation where you just

865
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,480
ship the the service b contents

866
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,080
essentially resolved service

867
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,200
be and that's really very compact it

868
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,760
should be fine

869
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,039
okay thank you ben i'll observe um i i

870
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,399
plan on taking just kirsty and ecker

871
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,880
for comments eliot if it can be really

872
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,720
quick i suppose you have snuck in under

873
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,760
the wire

874
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,679
we spent a long time on this slide then

875
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,120
we still have quite a few things to get

876
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,519
to

877
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,159
in the session so i think there's been a

878
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,240
lot of great discussion here and it's

879
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,320
certainly now um kind of well

880
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
encapsulated to bring to the list

881
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,200
to to hammer out the details so uh

882
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,760
kirsty please

883
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,600
thank you um i'll be quick sir elliott

884
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
can speak i'd just like to go back to a

885
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,799
point i don't think was really

886
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,200
addressed very well which is um in order

887
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
to know kind of what security things we

888
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,159
should be using here

889
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,640
we need a clear threat model and to know

890
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,320
what you're trying to protect

891
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
from who and what the assumed

892
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,200
capabilities are of your various

893
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,080
attackers

894
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,679
so i'd really like to have a lot more

895
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,279
discussion on what

896
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,000
problem this is solving and what you're

897
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
assuming of your attackers

898
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,039
thanks thank you kirsty

899
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,600
ecker glad to have you back yes i was

900
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,880
cleverly trying to make a contribution

901
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,440
to sag

902
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,639
um so um anyway um i mean i basically

903
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,320
agree with what ben was saying um you

904
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,800
know

905
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,239
that there's like there's some version

906
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,239
of the world where the hash like adds

907
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:14,719
value

908
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,719
but like it's like where you can't like

909
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,839
fit things in

910
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,000
like in the record or because like for

911
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,440
some reason people don't think like any

912
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,639
structure on the record is good which i

913
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,679
don't understand why that would be

914
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,520
i think putting it in lining it is

915
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,119
obviously better

916
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:34,560
if you can thank you ecker elliot please

917
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
good afternoon good morning i'm just

918
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,839
typing as fast as i can uh

919
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,040
just one quick comment about what uh ben

920
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,079
said uh or our refinement rather

921
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,280
dhcp ttls are all over the map

922
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,399
um in in in enterprises in in home

923
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,040
in homes and elsewhere uh they range

924
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,839
from

925
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,200
five minutes to hours i don't think

926
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
anybody uses longer than hours these

927
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,680
days

928
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,160
except in specialized cases so far as i

929
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,440
know at least it's not generally

930
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,040
considered best practice

931
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,599
at that point unless you have a

932
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,160
stability issue within the environment

933
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,880
um what i think then is is where i would

934
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,240
find agreement with ben

935
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,320
is that if you have to match the dns ttl

936
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,839
to a a dhcp

937
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,520
uh lifetime or an ra lifetime

938
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,760
um one of the important things to think

939
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,720
about then

940
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
is who owns each of those values in

941
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,880
terms of how they're set

942
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,040
um and that should receive a little bit

943
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,240
further consideration

944
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,279
and thanks for the time

945
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,800
thank you elliot um glenn

946
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,920
and med on to the next slide please yeah

947
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,280
thank you so thank you for all for

948
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,960
sending this comment to you

949
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,119
yeah so the in the next so this is this

950
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,640
is reflecting what we call the uh

951
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,240
simplified proposal this is based on

952
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
some of the inputs from

953
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,079
from then so he's basically uh proposing

954
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:00,480
that

955
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,680
he uh to consider the um to make the

956
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,320
uh the support of dot uh i would say

957
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,079
mandatory but for this one

958
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,720
we we have an issue as we um we can see

959
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,839
in the next slide please

960
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,000
is that this is this is basically

961
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,839
updating the existing rfcs and

962
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,839
it's it's really where to uh to require

963
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,599
to monitor some capabilities on the tank

964
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,800
that we are trying to

965
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,640
to discover and they and we think that

966
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,000
this is this is not an option for

967
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,400
us and um and also this is this is

968
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,200
beyond the uh the working group charter

969
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,680
so any comment on that part yeah i think

970
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,640
well i think ecker

971
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
has a direct comment right on that part

972
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
okay i i

973
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,119
don't understand why we're just moving

974
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,320
forward with the slides as if we didn't

975
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,520
have a long discussion about how this

976
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,920
direction was wrong

977
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,680
yeah i want just to make sure that the

978
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
option that was proposed by being atlas

979
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,880
for making monetary i would say the

980
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,960
support of duty is something that we

981
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,800
that is formally excluded by the working

982
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,280
group and that's it

983
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
okay but we surely have to reach that

984
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,240
question because like we just like

985
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,280
discussed entirely different direction

986
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,079
which doesn't require it

987
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,040
yeah um and yeah med

988
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,119
and theory would you like to address

989
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,119
that yeah yeah i mean if you're taking

990
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,480
the direction of putting the svcp

991
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,160
parameters in the dhcp i think rest of

992
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,119
the slides

993
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,800
are basically discussing uh if you have

994
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,400
to mandate dot based on what we were

995
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,839
discussing in the mailing list yesterday

996
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,320
but

997
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,839
they're no longer relevant for the

998
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,839
discussion so i think if there's

999
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,440
consistency to pick that approach we can

1000
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,720
update the draft and uh

1001
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,560
uh post revision if we see here

1002
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,760
no more objections to that

1003
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,079
so so i so let me jump in here i think

1004
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,839
the step here forward is

1005
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,480
take this to the list um whatever you

1006
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,359
think your

1007
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,280
whatever consensus you think you've sort

1008
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
of heard here to

1009
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
our med post it to the list let the list

1010
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,119
discuss

1011
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,800
it let's get to the point where

1012
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,160
everybody is sort of

1013
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,079
understanding what the proposal is at

1014
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,000
this current state after this discussion

1015
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,359
just took place

1016
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,440
and then we can also reevaluate where

1017
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,280
we're all at okay

1018
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
i think that's the next step forward

1019
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,759
from this discussion

1020
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,400
we're good okay yeah do we need any more

1021
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,760
slides from this deck or can we

1022
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,880
can we move on to the next there's only

1023
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
i think that's where with the um there

1024
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
is only one about the

1025
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,240
customization of the year tom plays but

1026
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,760
but i think that's that will be covered

1027
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,320
if we

1028
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,920
just include the default set of the

1029
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,320
video of the cpu option so i think we

1030
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:28,960
are done

1031
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,480
for this one okay thank you

1032
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,280
uh all right then so we're going to go

1033
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,720
on to the next

1034
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,920
uh discussion point in the agenda which

1035
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,320
is

1036
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,119
uh dns server information with assertion

1037
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,800
token

1038
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,560
uh who's speaking to this one dear

1039
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
uh hello everyone uh can you hear me

1040
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,240
yes yeah hey thanks next slide please

1041
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,920
yeah so we have done several revisions

1042
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,760
to the draft and we have received

1043
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,359
several comments from the working group

1044
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,079
and uh

1045
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,760
in the last working group session how we

1046
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,440
had presented the

1047
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,599
requirements for the resolver uh

1048
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,119
publishing its

1049
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,760
self description and we have updated the

1050
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,280
draft to align with district uh

1051
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,880
requirements

1052
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,359
um we would like to discuss the next

1053
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,800
steps for this draft and we have a

1054
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,320
couple of issues that we wanted to

1055
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,119
discuss

1056
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,839
and see how we would want to make

1057
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,040
progress

1058
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,759
next slide please

1059
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,040
this draft was trying to publish the

1060
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,800
resolver information it had various

1061
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,920
attributes i mean

1062
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,280
we had received several comments from

1063
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,200
the working group and

1064
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,119
the current list that you see is the one

1065
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,960
that had pub we had published yesterday

1066
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,920
which is the

1067
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,599
uh i would say the minimum set of

1068
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,920
requirements that there was consensus on

1069
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,599
that should be supported and we stripped

1070
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,520
off all the other attributes so

1071
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
that's it's very clear as you see it's

1072
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,960
just talking about the dna server

1073
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,040
capabilities whether it's doing doing

1074
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,920
minimization uh it's written in all the

1075
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,839
error code possible error codes that the

1076
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,520
server would return so for example a

1077
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,960
client would know that

1078
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,720
hey uh with their codes like blocked

1079
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,319
filtered and censored which are already

1080
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,560
defined in

1081
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,000
rfc8914 it would know that the server is

1082
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,440
performing filtering

1083
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,119
uh client auth is for basically

1084
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,560
identifying if the server

1085
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,880
can do client authentication uh we have

1086
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,319
changed the way the

1087
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,319
resolver information would be provided

1088
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,359
and uh

1089
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,119
based on the comments that we received

1090
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,480
from tommy it's changed to a

1091
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,960
simple generic unstructured resolver

1092
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
information which would provide

1093
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,960
uh probably the aps being used by the

1094
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,400
duh server

1095
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,560
what kind of templates it supports any

1096
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,400
contact information in case if

1097
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,319
the server is not reachable or it's very

1098
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,800
slow so it's mostly for troubleshooting

1099
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,079
and other purposes

1100
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,839
the other one that we had discussed in

1101
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,680
the last interim was to

1102
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,760
display and human friendly description

1103
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,520
of the resolver identity for the end

1104
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,720
user so

1105
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,640
the resolver information has been

1106
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,280
stripped off to this pair minimum set of

1107
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,839
information next slide please

1108
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,079
uh so there's one question right how do

1109
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,520
you convey the result of information so

1110
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
the draft has been always relying on

1111
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,400
uh res info uh resource record type for

1112
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,119
uh

1113
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,280
zero five version uh but then we saw

1114
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,240
that uh

1115
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,800
uh that draft was so even though it was

1116
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,599
adapted in

1117
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,000
dns of working group uh it got expired

1118
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,440
and uh we don't see any progress

1119
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,960
happening on that then we were thinking

1120
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,560
of looking into svcp

1121
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
resource record types but that doesn't

1122
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
suit like the right

1123
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,440
resource record type but because it's

1124
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,200
supposed to just give the alternate uh

1125
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800
equivalent services

1126
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,200
point to them and uh that's the

1127
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,480
discussion we are having with ben

1128
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,520
and uh now the issue that we have now is

1129
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,839
hey uh is do you want to revive that

1130
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,920
resin photograph or we can just add

1131
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,599
a very similar resource record type

1132
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,200
within this route which just

1133
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,440
supposed to publish the information in

1134
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,599
json format and we make progress of it

1135
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,200
so that's the

1136
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
one issue that we wanted to bring to the

1137
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,880
attention of the working group and get

1138
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,599
feedback on that

1139
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,119
would anybody like to comment on this

1140
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,440
issue

1141
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,520
uh hey so my my troll suggestion is to

1142
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,240
put this

1143
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,400
in uh resinfo as a txt record

1144
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,839
on resinfo.bind in the chaos class

1145
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
because that's what this is right this

1146
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,359
is this is

1147
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,920
like version.bind this is server

1148
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,000
debugging info

1149
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
uh that is designed to be more or less

1150
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
human readable

1151
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,400
um just you know so we have a pattern

1152
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,079
for that but i assume everybody will

1153
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,319
hate that so leaving that aside

1154
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,680
um i i do support

1155
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,880
i do support using the the res info

1156
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,240
rr type or a txt record on a

1157
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,040
on a well-known name

1158
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,079
thank you ben

1159
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,560
well i'm not sure thank you is the right

1160
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,839
response to that

1161
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,800
um no one else so let's move on to the

1162
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,480
next slide please yeah thanks thanks for

1163
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,839
that uh

1164
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,640
another issue was the resolver assistant

1165
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,599
information i mean

1166
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,280
yeah i mean we had quite discussed why

1167
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,119
do you need that uh

1168
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,400
and what are the advantages it's

1169
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,160
basically talking about cryptographic

1170
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,599
assertions that would be

1171
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,599
provided along with the resolve of

1172
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,280
information for

1173
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,839
the client to validate whether it's this

1174
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,760
is always actually hosted by and

1175
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,599
legitimate organization if some

1176
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,839
legitimate organization had done any

1177
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,160
audit on this dns server for it to know

1178
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,880
that hey

1179
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,760
uh uh it's not being host by an attacker

1180
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,319
so

1181
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,040
uh ben had suggested that keep this

1182
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,240
draft simple and keep

1183
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,800
this resolver assistant token separate

1184
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,839
so that uh

1185
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,839
we can discuss the need for it and what

1186
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,359
kind of threats it addresses and what

1187
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,280
what sort of scenarios it is required

1188
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,119
and whether there are other mechanisms

1189
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,880
where we can do this out of band without

1190
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,680
having to

1191
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,040
embed it within the uh within a jwt

1192
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,920
right so

1193
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,680
ah that's a question again back to the

1194
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,200
working group if the working group wants

1195
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,960
this graph to just specifically

1196
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,800
stick to the resolve information that we

1197
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
just saw and take this out of the draft

1198
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,400
and discuss it and

1199
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,880
probably debate uh if this is something

1200
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,319
that we want to solve or

1201
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,560
is this the right way to solve it and uh

1202
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,119
are there any better ways of doing it

1203
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,480
emilia please

1204
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,040
yeah hi tierra just a a stupid little

1205
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,240
thing but

1206
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,920
can you please everybody's going to get

1207
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,400
confused with rat because of rats

1208
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,040
and remote attestation and it's really

1209
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,720
these areas are really close just like

1210
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,599
something else

1211
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,119
sorry to take the working groups time

1212
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,359
with this but you know it's hard enough

1213
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,800
to read this stuff without getting lost

1214
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,920
in acronyms

1215
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,880
it it is uh no need for a policy yeah i

1216
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,640
i realized after putting that name that

1217
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,400
it resembles what's happening in rats

1218
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,119
working group

1219
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:04,720
i will figure out some other name yeah

1220
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,560
we will remove change that elliot thanks

1221
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,440
for that

1222
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,920
but but it resembles the for the working

1223
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
group interest it resembles the

1224
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,839
background check that we have in the

1225
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,599
rats architecture so it's very close to

1226
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,240
what

1227
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,160
is being discussed in the rat's working

1228
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,440
group

1229
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,920
so so so my suggestion here is i think

1230
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,880
in order to us

1231
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,319
track this and manage it i think a

1232
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,800
separate draft would be

1233
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,760
the the right path here uh if if the

1234
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,200
group makes the decision we can always

1235
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,560
fold it back in

1236
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,040
uh into the the main work but i think a

1237
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,240
separate draft would allow us to track

1238
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,839
and discuss it more effectively

1239
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,000
so sure for what it's worth for mature

1240
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,839
view

1241
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,920
yeah i don't see an issue with that so

1242
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,280
yeah

1243
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,880
i mean that probably makes the resolver

1244
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,800
information to progress much faster so

1245
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,720
why not it also makes it easier

1246
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,400
ultimately we need to link to some other

1247
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,200
external group

1248
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,160
that wants to also weigh in on it so

1249
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,720
okay

1250
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,960
moving on um i think that's about it i i

1251
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,640
think probably it's too early called for

1252
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,839
working competition based on this

1253
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,760
because we have work to do and uh we'll

1254
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,280
probably show you guys draft split this

1255
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,720
draft into two and then we'll take it to

1256
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,680
the list so

1257
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,920
yeah thanks for all the comments and uh

1258
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,359
looking forward for further comments

1259
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,400
after we posted the questions

1260
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,760
okay thank you uh so we're at 4 46

1261
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,640
uh here 46 minutes 14 minutes a hour do

1262
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,480
we want to take a short break now

1263
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,560
since it's the natural sort of place or

1264
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,760
do we want to

1265
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,119
uh trudge on with the next uh draft

1266
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,760
um as your co-chair i think let's move

1267
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,240
on to the next and then take the break

1268
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
awesome okay the next one who's speaking

1269
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,520
to this one

1270
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,359
yeah i i will speak i'll speak to this

1271
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,359
one as well so

1272
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,440
uh we just published this a few weeks

1273
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,000
back and and there was tremendous

1274
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,520
response from the working group thanks

1275
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:57,839
for that next slide please

1276
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
yeah we'll just i'm not going to go into

1277
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,680
too many details with the proposed

1278
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,280
mechanism we'll just talk about the goal

1279
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,960
scope and the issues uh

1280
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,640
so that we can discuss more on the

1281
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,560
issues and next steps

1282
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,839
next slide

1283
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,560
uh this is again what we had presented

1284
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,640
uh as one of the emerging requirements

1285
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,040
in the

1286
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,800
interim working group so i'll just

1287
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,640
reiterate that without taking too much

1288
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,640
time that's to discover local names

1289
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,720
uh this is very similar to what was done

1290
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,200
in the abstract me working group

1291
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,520
where the vpn client would discover the

1292
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,880
internal domains

1293
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,040
and uh the other one was to discover if

1294
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,800
the network allows splitting its

1295
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,400
configuration

1296
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,839
next slide

1297
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,559
yeah uh the scope was is pretty limited

1298
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,839
to uh uh

1299
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,359
networks where the client can

1300
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,119
authenticate the identity of the network

1301
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:49,520
so

1302
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,079
it has some pre-existing relationship uh

1303
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,119
this draft is

1304
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,559
the scope of this draft currently is

1305
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,440
restricted to uh vod devices joining an

1306
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,400
enterprise network

1307
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,160
without any mdm and configuration

1308
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,079
profile because if they have that

1309
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,400
then those secure mechanisms mdm can be

1310
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,920
used to provision the domain with the

1311
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,520
provision the device with

1312
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,280
the internal domains or the

1313
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,720
configuration profile could be

1314
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,720
used to solve that problem and in this

1315
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,760
case the

1316
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,599
user trusts the network to override the

1317
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,440
dns settings similar to the b

1318
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,520
uh if you are using any vpn today you

1319
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,040
can disable vpn let's say in my

1320
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,720
enterprise network or my home network

1321
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,680
next slide please

1322
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,920
uh so what we are doing to solve the

1323
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,520
problem so we picked pvds

1324
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,440
uh provisioning domains for solving the

1325
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,880
problem provisioning domains is supposed

1326
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,599
to provide the

1327
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,480
dns resolver information uh so it also

1328
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,119
gives you

1329
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,839
an option of web dvds where the client

1330
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,079
would be provided the well-known uri of

1331
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,480
the http server which would have the

1332
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,559
additional information and that

1333
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,800
is where we are providing the internal

1334
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,319
domains and to let the client know

1335
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,079
whether they're private only or

1336
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,000
they're public but because you're

1337
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,520
attached to the network you get to see a

1338
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,200
different version of the

1339
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,759
content next slide please

1340
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,960
yeah uh this is a very simple format

1341
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,800
example that we picked the first three

1342
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,359
are already defined in the pvd web pvd

1343
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,480
rfc so the this draft is just talking

1344
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,319
about the domain names and to say

1345
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:17,760
whether they are really internal

1346
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,040
or they are not internal but they

1347
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,280
you get to see a different view of the

1348
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,800
content because you are attached to that

1349
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,800
specific network

1350
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,839
next slide

1351
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,119
yeah the uh this uh this specific issue

1352
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,640
had a lot of discussion in the working

1353
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,440
group that

1354
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,200
uh how does the client know that the

1355
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,880
network is not lying right i mean it

1356
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,559
needs to know that

1357
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,720
so the the network doesn't want to uh

1358
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,480
invade on your privacy and look into the

1359
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,400
dns request responses to see what the

1360
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,520
client is doing

1361
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,280
so what would be the best way for the

1362
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,640
client to know that the

1363
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,280
server is not lying so uh this was a

1364
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,720
suggestion that came from ben i have

1365
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,480
already posted in revised draft to say

1366
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,119
that

1367
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,200
the the easiest way for it to do is if

1368
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,440
it has a pre-configured resolver then

1369
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,240
uh just to insect three uh n63 is the

1370
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,760
most recommended way of getting an

1371
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,359
authenticated response to say that the

1372
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,040
domains doesn't exist and

1373
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,760
if indeed the response is insecurity

1374
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,800
then it proves that

1375
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,559
the domains don't exist and the network

1376
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,920
is not lying to you

1377
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,839
uh uh the draft also talks about a

1378
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,040
scenario where

1379
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,680
uh let's imagine if the public resolver

1380
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,880
is not reachable

1381
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
or the client has not pre-configured

1382
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,960
with a public resolver then probably

1383
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,800
uh one possible way that we saw the ike

1384
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,720
split dns draft was talking about is to

1385
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,920
pre-configure

1386
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,160
uh top weld-on domains and dles which

1387
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,079
needs to be constantly updated

1388
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,960
uh uh to see if the server is lying it's

1389
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,720
not a foolproof technique

1390
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,240
but it can be possibly uh used by an

1391
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,680
implementation in case

1392
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,599
uh if the resolver is not available or

1393
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,200
it could just hard fail and decide that

1394
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,680
hey

1395
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,280
since somebody's blocking that and i

1396
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,119
can't validate that i'll just hard fail

1397
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,480
and not do anything so

1398
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,040
uh uh the draft is leaving those options

1399
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,640
open so that the working group can give

1400
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,760
us more feedback

1401
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,079
uh but we have listed both the ones as

1402
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,839
as possible mechanisms so that we can

1403
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,119
have more discussion

1404
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,119
and to see what uh uh we would want to

1405
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,839
propose to make progress on this

1406
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,160
so um question yeah i have one question

1407
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,119
so are you considering the two scenarios

1408
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:23,599
where

1409
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,359
or actually i see three scenarios here

1410
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:26,800
one is the

1411
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,119
the domain does truly does not exist in

1412
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,559
the global dns and so

1413
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,280
of course that will be testable and fail

1414
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,839
but

1415
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:35,040
you could have a situation where

1416
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,960
somebody publishes a non-signed

1417
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,640
version of that domain in order to try

1418
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,880
to hack the the private

1419
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,599
the private hosted domain network and so

1420
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,359
you put a lot of dependency down on

1421
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,440
the environment to be able to detect and

1422
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,800
do a validation that's

1423
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,000
case number two case number three is the

1424
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,559
uh the owner of that domain has both an

1425
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,720
internal and external versions of it

1426
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,280
um but those two different versions are

1427
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,400
not aligned

1428
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,000
uh in in their record sets yeah

1429
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,920
so to answer that question right i mean

1430
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,160
uh we have another issue where we talk

1431
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,200
about uh

1432
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,960
domains which are public and you have a

1433
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,240
different view so that's a different

1434
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,680
topic and that will be covered in a

1435
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,880
separate way

1436
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,040
uh that ben had suggested we had updated

1437
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,240
the draft so that is dealt with a

1438
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,280
different technique

1439
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,760
so there are actually uh two and three

1440
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,960
techniques that we're just talking about

1441
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,319
two techniques here for

1442
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,160
this is only for private domains we have

1443
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,319
another for another technique for uh

1444
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,440
public domains

1445
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,040
and maybe we'll go over that so that we

1446
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,319
can take more comments so that it would

1447
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:34,800
give a

1448
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,400
perspective of all the techniques that

1449
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,160
are discussed in the draft

1450
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,400
okay is that the next slide yeah it's

1451
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,640
the next slide yes

1452
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,520
yeah this is this is a uh this is

1453
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,559
something that we had discussed uh

1454
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,920
in length and read during the working

1455
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,079
groups uh mailing list so one technique

1456
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,359
that was proposed which was very

1457
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,040
straightforward was

1458
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,319
what happens in case if you have a

1459
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:58,400
different version of the

1460
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,079
public domain in the attached network so

1461
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,079
in that case the client needs to know

1462
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,480
that

1463
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,680
uh the network is in in fact claiming

1464
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,599
authority and it is indeed the owner of

1465
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,040
that sort right so

1466
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,200
the technique that we are aware updated

1467
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,200
the draft is to say that the client just

1468
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,319
does in ns query lookup to get the uh

1469
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,359
uh name servers to see that if the name

1470
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,160
servers match

1471
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,079
the adn of the discovered network

1472
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,280
provided resolver

1473
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,359
then it pretty much sure that hey the

1474
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,240
network is actually

1475
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,920
he's claiming authority of the domain

1476
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,680
and and the ns response record is

1477
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,720
proving that

1478
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,040
and then what the client can do is uh

1479
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,400
authenticate the network provided

1480
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,680
resolver as usual

1481
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,119
using the mechanisms that we had

1482
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,359
discussed in dnr and ddr drafts and

1483
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,079
resolve those domains in the tv

1484
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,599
so those are the three mechanisms that

1485
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,839
we have in the draft

1486
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,319
and would like to get more feedback on

1487
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:57,440
this

1488
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,880
and okay ben please

1489
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,520
hi uh so thanks a lot for making all

1490
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,640
these changes

1491
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,079
i i really um

1492
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,040
at a technical level i really like this

1493
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,520
version

1494
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,720
of the draft i think it it maintains uh

1495
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,119
it does something new i think it

1496
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:19,839
achieves

1497
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,200
a a version of split dns that maintains

1498
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,680
a

1499
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,160
new interesting security invariant i

1500
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,880
really

1501
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,599
appreciate that the thing that i'm

1502
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,400
missing here

1503
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,400
is and that i think we should

1504
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,960
ask for here is whether there's

1505
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,359
essentially client-side implementer

1506
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,920
interest you know are there is there

1507
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,960
anybody

1508
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,559
who who who implements a client

1509
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,079
whose behavior would actually be

1510
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,640
affected by this

1511
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,640
that that is interested in supporting it

1512
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,079
um because most

1513
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,280
clients the simple clients are

1514
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,520
don't need this a simple client will

1515
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,680
simply use

1516
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,240
either its own resolver if it wants to

1517
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,040
use its own

1518
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,640
resolver or it will use the resolver

1519
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,240
provided over dnr

1520
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,280
in which case there's no need for

1521
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,839
for this because that resolver can

1522
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:21,359
simply provide

1523
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,760
the answers that were that we're talking

1524
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,599
about

1525
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,440
so the case where this matters is where

1526
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,119
the client

1527
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,760
wants to put itself into a configuration

1528
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,799
where it's using multiple resolvers

1529
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:35,920
and if there are clients that are

1530
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,319
interested in implementing that behavior

1531
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:41,920
then that then

1532
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,559
i think this is a good start on how to

1533
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,079
do

1534
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,599
thank you ben tommy paul we please

1535
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,839
speaking as a client implementer i am

1536
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,520
interested in solving

1537
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,960
this overall problem um i agree that for

1538
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,359
the

1539
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,720
default status quo cases

1540
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,839
you know people are either using

1541
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,040
um the default network resolver

1542
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,240
or they're using something that they've

1543
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,079
hard coded to

1544
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,200
override that but

1545
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,920
on the client i would like to move to

1546
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,960
scenarios where we can have

1547
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,160
a more private and

1548
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,200
stance by default for certain categories

1549
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,160
of traffic that

1550
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,839
doesn't necessarily um use anything that

1551
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,119
the network provides

1552
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,040
unless we can prove that the network is

1553
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,599
authoritative for something um

1554
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,480
and essentially the the model that you

1555
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,760
have if you don't have

1556
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,559
a secure way to validate

1557
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,359
that a network does have access to some

1558
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,720
private

1559
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,880
domain is that you try over some other

1560
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,480
mechanism you realize it doesn't exist

1561
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,280
there and then you

1562
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,079
fall back to going locally which works

1563
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,359
but is inefficient

1564
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,480
so this would be um or something solving

1565
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,920
this

1566
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,680
area not just for dns but saying that

1567
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,760
this network has kind of special

1568
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,760
authority over a given domain

1569
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,079
would be a useful thing on our client

1570
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,720
thanks tommy

1571
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,640
thank you before we move on the feedback

1572
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,480
that i'm hearing is that tyro is on the

1573
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,079
right track with all of this if

1574
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,400
somebody has pushed back on that um

1575
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,079
now would be the time to jump in and let

1576
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,660
us know

1577
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,690
[Music]

1578
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,680
three two one next please

1579
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,440
yeah uh yeah uh i i think we have

1580
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,799
addressed so far all the comments that

1581
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,839
we have received and we would write more

1582
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,000
feedback uh

1583
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,839
maybe after that we can if there's

1584
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,680
really i've seen interest in the from

1585
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,119
the working group so

1586
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,880
uh very very best for working with

1587
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,680
adaption of the draft

1588
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,839
thank you

1589
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,359
glenn back to you well it seems like

1590
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,119
we've reached a happy place for a

1591
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,160
five-minute break

1592
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,440
in order so um

1593
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,160
everybody uh that would be three minutes

1594
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,760
after the hour so come on back let's

1595
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,079
let's

1596
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,440
give you if i give you two five minutes

1597
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,559
after that we're sorry yeah that's

1598
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:27,680
around there right

1599
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,880
after the hour so okay

1600
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,400
we're on break to five minutes after

1601
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
there

1602
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,839
okay

1603
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,839
hmm

1604
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,960
if i were a rich man

1605
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:59,839
if i were a wealthy man

1606
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,839
that's the end of your break there so

1607
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,960
back to clan

1608
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,720
and we'll be testing the youtube

1609
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,559
copyright filters with that

1610
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:11,119
performance

1611
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,200
all right moving on uh the next one

1612
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,598
is

1613
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:22,480
hang on here

1614
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,319
oh wow my gosh okay back to the agenda

1615
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,319
so we are now moving to the open

1616
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,240
microphone section of the uh

1617
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,599
the show um

1618
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,599
and for those who do not have comments

1619
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,960
for the the microphone i

1620
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,559
i offer you this fun happy cat

1621
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,119
to stare at for the next few minutes

1622
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,400
while we have

1623
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:51,119
a barrage of conversations

1624
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,720
so this is open mic you can talk about

1625
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,319
any topic around edd

1626
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,559
uh this is you know usually this crowd

1627
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,480
is not very shy

1628
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,079
um so i imagine we're gonna have some

1629
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,880
good conversations

1630
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,880
andrew kempling please

1631
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:10,720
somebody has to be first um uh

1632
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,200
i mean i think it's really encouraging

1633
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,400
to see that we're

1634
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,799
potentially getting to the point where

1635
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,079
we've got solutions around

1636
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,000
both split dns and so the private ip

1637
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,720
address

1638
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:26,400
uh dns forwarder use cases

1639
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,559
because if we're going to get to the to

1640
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:30,160
solve the 85

1641
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,280
problem um that eric auth

1642
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,920
highlighted via one of his colleagues at

1643
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,880
the uh

1644
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,200
virtual interim uh it's incredibly

1645
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,960
important we've got solutions for both

1646
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,680
of those

1647
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,119
so it feels like we're on the cusp of

1648
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,240
making good progress

1649
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,240
uh in both those areas which is

1650
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,720
encouraging

1651
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:54,799
i don't know what others think on that

1652
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,839
andrew

1653
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,760
um i'll observe that we had

1654
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,000
quite a lot of discussion on that very

1655
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,359
first slide of the session

1656
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,200
that if we want to revisit that now that

1657
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,400
would also be a

1658
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,839
very reasonable use of time

1659
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,319
tyro please i saw the proposal from uh

1660
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,720
the issue that ben had raised for the

1661
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,599
air draft

1662
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,359
with regard to using the specially

1663
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,039
assigned domain name and

1664
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,079
uh how it's possible to do uh

1665
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:39,599
both authenticated discovery and

1666
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,440
opportunistic discovery

1667
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:44,240
for cases where there is a legacy router

1668
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,240
whose firmware cannot be updated

1669
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,640
this is where uh uh probably its

1670
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,960
firmware can be updated but just to

1671
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,599
update the dhcp server configuration uh

1672
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,079
where

1673
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,920
uh and the cases were a scenario where

1674
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,400
the

1675
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,720
router is doing dns filtering in that

1676
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,079
case what would be the

1677
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,880
uh fallback mechanism so i i think that

1678
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,680
uh

1679
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:07,359
that changes that here proposed should

1680
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:08,799
address the

1681
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:12,240
cases of all the you know uh uh

1682
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:15,520
legacy router scenarios so uh i i think

1683
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:15,920
i think

1684
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,158
i think having more discussion on that

1685
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:19,600
at making progress and

1686
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,158
uh probably either uh adding that to the

1687
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:24,560
ddr draft or separate draft would make

1688
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,799
a quick progress on that because that's

1689
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:28,238
looked like an a straightforward

1690
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,959
proposal to me

1691
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:39,839
thank you

1692
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,479
i have to say that glenn and i did not

1693
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,880
anticipate that

1694
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,359
an open mic session at add would be so

1695
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,120
quiet

1696
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,920
so let me bring up one point that i i

1697
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:58,319
that

1698
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,080
i know has been some side conversations

1699
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,359
you went on about uh

1700
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,040
based upon comments from session number

1701
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,960
one and that is around

1702
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,600
uh the rfc 1918 uh cp devices

1703
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,040
uh places using ecg nav

1704
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,560
stuff like that and the ability for

1705
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,600
some of the proposed approaches

1706
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,560
to work and support that environment so

1707
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,520
this is uh

1708
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,399
primarily you know it seems like a lot

1709
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,640
of european isps have their cps defined

1710
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,679
in this way

1711
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:32,960
uh it's present in mobile devices mobile

1712
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,120
some mobile setups i've been told that

1713
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,719
some of the asian isp

1714
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,158
networks also have this situation

1715
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,158
do people want to sort of talk about

1716
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:48,000
that and bring it up

1717
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,439
uh yeah tara please yeah so

1718
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:54,320
uh so uh i i can talk it from doctor

1719
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,320
from my company's perspective what we do

1720
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,520
right i mean

1721
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,920
uh uh we offer both enterprise and

1722
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,760
consumer security services network

1723
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,800
services and

1724
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,800
uh one of the one that we offer for

1725
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,120
consumer network security is offering

1726
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,960
uh network security services on home

1727
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,239
routers so

1728
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,239
we deploy our network security services

1729
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,880
on both managed and managed devices

1730
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,920
and because we are running a network

1731
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,199
security service there

1732
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,920
uh these routers are quite easily

1733
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,960
upgradable

1734
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,320
because we have to keep upgrading the

1735
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,440
stack to address new vulnerabilities

1736
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,040
getting new uh signatures so that we can

1737
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,480
handle new threats so

1738
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,800
uh that's the reason one of the interest

1739
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,480
is for us to host

1740
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,040
uh uh at uh ot forwarder on the home

1741
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,080
router so that

1742
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:43,440
we can still enforce uh uh

1743
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,880
security policies either it could be

1744
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,040
anomaly detection or it could be

1745
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,159
uh uh uh filtering any managers domains

1746
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:50,719
or

1747
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:53,040
uh enforcing mud policies is of great

1748
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,800
interest to that and we just shipped

1749
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,760
our uh product doing that so uh so

1750
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,040
that's the reason

1751
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,239
i see that we see both the scenarios

1752
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:02,960
where

1753
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,400
uh there are routers which are

1754
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,239
upgradable but we also see

1755
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,640
some combination from isps where there

1756
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,239
are legacy routers

1757
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:12,080
and whose firmware cannot be updated and

1758
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:13,760
we don't give any security services

1759
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:14,560
other than

1760
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,320
uh uh relying on the isp to do some

1761
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,000
uh security protection in that case

1762
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,679
which is probably at a home network

1763
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:22,960
level and not at a

1764
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,880
device specific level uh especially for

1765
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,840
iot devices

1766
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:32,159
thank you jim reed please

1767
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,960
thanks david um i agree with what glenn

1768
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,679
was saying that

1769
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,080
the case and the use cases around things

1770
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,159
to do with rc 1980 nets

1771
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,120
and cgnat is something this working

1772
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,320
group can look at

1773
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,679
i'm not sure we can do much of a

1774
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,159
discussion about it here and now

1775
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,679
because i think the first thing we'll

1776
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,960
need to do well one of the things we're

1777
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,080
going to have to do is

1778
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,520
have a draft that talks to these

1779
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,280
particular concerns

1780
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,199
and to some try and crystallize some of

1781
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,120
the major issues around it

1782
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,480
i think another thing that needs to be

1783
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,960
done in that area is more engagement

1784
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,360
and involvement from the operators of

1785
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,800
those kind of networks

1786
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,400
also maybe some enterprise networks as

1787
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,120
well and because i think if we try to

1788
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,280
second guess what's going in there

1789
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:14,880
between sambas will have some

1790
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,880
insights into this but if we try to

1791
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:17,920
second guess

1792
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,920
how things are done in those settings

1793
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,920
the chances are we'll make mistakes and

1794
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,520
that would not be good

1795
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,480
so yeah i think this is a work item for

1796
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:27,679
further considerations

1797
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,400
at some point for the working group i'm

1798
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,320
not sure we can do much of a discussion

1799
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,960
right now in this open mic session

1800
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,400
something else just changing the subject

1801
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:37,920
slightly quick i'll just mention while

1802
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,560
here

1803
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,280
is i'm certainly suffering from a bit of

1804
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,159
confusion

1805
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,679
about the number of documents i've

1806
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,760
gotten where the status is just down

1807
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,080
what needs to be done to progress them

1808
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,480
and maybe i'll delegate this upload to

1809
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:53,120
steam's working group chairs and maybe

1810
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,040
they can post a summary to the list

1811
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,360
i mean it'd be a good idea to know as to

1812
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,239
what we think

1813
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,159
when documents might be in a position to

1814
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,679
already be considered safe for working

1815
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,040
group adoption

1816
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,719
or to be progressing maybe say for

1817
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,640
discussion at the next meeting

1818
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,159
that i think will be very quiet that

1819
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:09,440
would be very helpful particularly

1820
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,880
because the discussion we've just had

1821
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,440
them

1822
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,040
a little bit confused about the status

1823
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,400
of some of the drafts thanks

1824
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,040
thanks

1825
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,679
regarding the 1918 uh private address

1826
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:28,560
issue i think

1827
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,960
uh it was interesting ben we talked

1828
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,239
about this on tuesday

1829
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,880
ben mentioned that he'd he had a fpr and

1830
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,480
he's moved that into the

1831
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:39,920
into the ddr um repo i i

1832
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,239
i'm very supportive of that i'd really

1833
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,239
be interested to see if the

1834
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,800
uh the authors can incorporate that or

1835
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,840
something like that

1836
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,480
in the uh in the next version of the

1837
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:51,520
draft because it

1838
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,600
i think that really that really

1839
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,960
addresses the

1840
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,880
uh the issues around private id

1841
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,600
addresses and legacy cpes which

1842
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,600
as we said if they're not currently in

1843
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,080
the draft

1844
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,640
thank you neil tommy paulie

1845
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,400
hello uh just to respond to that um

1846
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,360
i i totally agree that addressing that

1847
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,880
case is very important

1848
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,800
um and i think we do want to

1849
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,320
merge something in around that

1850
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,400
personally i think if you look at the

1851
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,400
discussion there i i think there's

1852
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,560
i have a bit of concern around you know

1853
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,440
mandating

1854
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,480
a five-minute retry timer on

1855
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,760
all clients um so i think the particular

1856
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,600
mechanism

1857
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,719
needs more discussion and input from the

1858
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:45,520
group so

1859
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,480
i would ask that people do look at that

1860
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,120
proposal

1861
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,640
and try to think about different ways we

1862
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,280
can solve that problem

1863
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,480
thank you thank you tommy

1864
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:03,440
so uh from from the chairs here um ben i

1865
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,800
see you're up next in the queue

1866
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,000
since you were i was going to make a

1867
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,360
suggestion that since you are the one

1868
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,960
that submitted the pull request

1869
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,280
um and in the fact that we do want to

1870
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,440
have primary discussion go on

1871
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,560
on the list and not just over in

1872
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,560
the world of github would it be possible

1873
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,920
for you to maybe post

1874
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,199
to the list a a pointer to that uh pr

1875
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,120
and and some pros around it

1876
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,159
so i i did uh yesterday i believe

1877
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:35,199
um send uh send the link to the list

1878
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:38,800
and uh sent maybe a one sentence summary

1879
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,640
um i can certainly expand on that a

1880
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,560
little more

1881
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,719
the uh as as tommy pointed out there's a

1882
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,600
you know probably the most well there's

1883
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,080
a few

1884
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,320
a few different aspects of this proposal

1885
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:56,000
that aren't entirely trivial

1886
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:01,120
and one of them is this question of

1887
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,400
you know what does it mean to to

1888
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,880
get an authentication anchor from an

1889
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,800
untrusted source

1890
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,760
so you get a reference identity a the

1891
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,600
name of a resolver something you can

1892
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,520
validate but you get it

1893
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,800
from a dns

1894
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,480
server operating on a private ip address

1895
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,360
and so you have no particular security

1896
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,960
mechanism there except

1897
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,719
that whoever is operating that dns

1898
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:30,640
server if you don't upgrade to encrypted

1899
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,960
dns will still see all of your queries

1900
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:38,080
and so then there's this question

1901
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,600
of um what is it

1902
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,280
you know what does it mean to do that

1903
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,159
upgrade securely and i think the answer

1904
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,199
is

1905
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,640
uh the the upgrade is is secure

1906
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,040
if you haven't converted a transient

1907
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:55,040
attacker into a persistent attacker

1908
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:57,040
if there is a persistent attacker you're

1909
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,480
hosed either way

1910
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,880
you can accomplish nothing so we don't

1911
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,000
have to worry about it

1912
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,600
you can't make it any worse um if

1913
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,760
there's a transient attacker then you

1914
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:08,719
have to be careful

1915
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,840
not to give them permanent access when

1916
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,360
maybe they would have disappeared after

1917
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,640
a few minutes

1918
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,679
um and and then you would have

1919
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,360
been back in a secure state so i set

1920
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,080
this

1921
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,800
i just typed in this arbitrary um

1922
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,920
originally

1923
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,159
requirement now downgraded to should

1924
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,679
level recommendation

1925
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,199
that says you should just repeat this

1926
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:32,880
process every five minutes

1927
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,320
so if there's an attacker they can only

1928
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,640
who can briefly redirect you to an

1929
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:39,679
encrypted server

1930
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:41,199
that will only last for five minutes and

1931
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:42,880
then you're going to go check again and

1932
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,400
if the attacker has gone away

1933
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,080
you'll you'll flip to the correct

1934
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,080
configuration

1935
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,800
that is certainly not the only heuristic

1936
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,239
that we can imagine for this

1937
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,080
and i would definitely appreciate more

1938
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,640
input on how to phrase that requirement

1939
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:56,960
and

1940
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,400
what sort of behaviors we should

1941
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,799
recommend

1942
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,880
thank you ben please

1943
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,760
uh to respond to ben right i mean and

1944
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,760
typically what i have seen is

1945
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,600
this there's more of a chances that

1946
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,199
there is a transient attacker who's

1947
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:14,000
probably

1948
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,320
hosting an evil twin or there's a device

1949
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,679
which is compromised

1950
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,600
uh rather than an attacker which is

1951
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,120
which is always persistent

1952
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,440
in which case there's nothing to do so i

1953
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,520
think handling the case of

1954
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,040
either picking an timer which is random

1955
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,520
or

1956
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,920
uh basically having trust on first use

1957
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,560
where

1958
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,080
you pin the information and you next

1959
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,159
time come in and you change see a change

1960
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:38,159
then you have some suspicion so there

1961
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,000
could be various ways where

1962
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,600
uh uh you could identify that transit

1963
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,080
and i think that's far more important

1964
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:47,120
case than

1965
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,040
uh probably a very less scenario where

1966
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,040
an attacker has

1967
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,800
taken over the network and is always

1968
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,159
there to

1969
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:57,360
snoop your dns traffic

1970
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:04,400
uh thank you cheerio jim marine please

1971
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,040
it's ben made a very good point there

1972
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,880
about the differentiation between

1973
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,199
transient and persistent attackers

1974
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,320
and i wonder how we can address that in

1975
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,520
our documents

1976
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,199
is this something we have to think about

1977
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,600
more generally or do we incorporate that

1978
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,840
into the security considerations of the

1979
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,520
internet drafts

1980
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,400
and rfcs that we produce maybe after

1981
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,040
says this

1982
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:31,360
particular uh threat or security

1983
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,920
security defense mechanism will be

1984
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:34,480
reasonable

1985
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,640
we consider is reasonably safe against a

1986
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,080
transient attacker

1987
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,520
but will not succeed against a

1988
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,440
persistent malicious attacker

1989
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,640
and i think it might be good to have

1990
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,600
graduate graduations in in terms of

1991
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,120
the responses and behaviors and the

1992
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,040
risks and the threats there's probably

1993
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,480
going to be need for a matrix that kind

1994
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,000
of stuff and i'm not sure

1995
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,320
how best to encapsulate that and

1996
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,280
document it

1997
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,280
does it go into individual drafts or

1998
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,560
does it have to go into a separate

1999
01:19:58,560 --> 01:19:59,199
document

2000
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:04,719
all on its own thank you jim

2001
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:08,480
andrew campbling um i think mate jim

2002
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,840
made a good point and i was just going

2003
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,239
to say

2004
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,840
uh would it make sense to uh expand the

2005
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,040
content of the

2006
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,360
uh uh i can't remember what it's called

2007
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,560
the user requirements document um

2008
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,320
the the the working group recently

2009
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,239
adopted to

2010
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,120
uh incorporate those sort of different

2011
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,520
scenarios

2012
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,480
so let me speak to that one um andrew i

2013
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:33,360
think

2014
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,760
since that group so the sales document

2015
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,360
we ended up with sort of

2016
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,040
adopted for work group info only and

2017
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,719
that we wouldn't continue to like expand

2018
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,159
upon it as a group

2019
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,760
certainly the authors can make fixes and

2020
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,679
stuff like that and put stuff in there

2021
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:48,080
but if i can suggest if we want to do

2022
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,280
new things like that

2023
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,040
then let's try to do them in smaller

2024
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,960
documents which capture that issue

2025
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,960
and then ultimately if we need to roll

2026
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,800
these things up when they get consensus

2027
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,679
into a larger

2028
01:20:57,679 --> 01:20:59,199
thing we can do that but it's a little

2029
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,960
bit easier to deal with them

2030
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,760
in isolation

2031
01:21:04,540 --> 01:21:06,080
[Music]

2032
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,199
that's my that's my five cents

2033
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:14,000
thank you glenn tommy paulie please

2034
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,040
yeah i mean just to that point

2035
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:20,800
um yeah i agree that

2036
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,280
these type of considerations belong in

2037
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,639
smaller documents or in the existing

2038
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,000
documents i think this particular point

2039
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,280
we were talking about probably

2040
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,800
just does belong in the security

2041
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,760
considerations or something as part of

2042
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:34,880
ddr um and then the reason i got in

2043
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,080
queue i was

2044
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:39,440
looking at the pr um and so when we're

2045
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,840
talking about

2046
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:44,800
transient attacker case you know what

2047
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,639
we're trying to do by reconfirming this

2048
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,400
discovery process

2049
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,600
is make sure that we didn't get tricked

2050
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,000
on the first time when we

2051
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,440
[Music]

2052
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,280
learn about this encrypted resolver

2053
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,000
maybe it's an evil encrypted resolver

2054
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,600
and so we keep trying to reconfirm it um

2055
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,800
presumably again using that unsecured

2056
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,719
path

2057
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,560
what stops the transient attacker

2058
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,920
from then blocking the message

2059
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,360
later because the pr currently says

2060
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,560
you know we should repeat the process

2061
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,560
and confirm if it's still valid

2062
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,239
and we must stop using the encrypted

2063
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,000
resolver if it's no longer designated so

2064
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,880
this

2065
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,120
allows essentially any attacker to just

2066
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,400
drop

2067
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:34,000
um one of the discovery responses

2068
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,360
and get the clients to

2069
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,040
tear down their encrypted channels

2070
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,040
so i think it'd be great to have

2071
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:44,080
something

2072
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,360
where we can eventually ratchet up to a

2073
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,320
level of security where we do not fall

2074
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,679
back down i don't know what the answer

2075
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:52,719
for that is

2076
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,719
um but i'm a bit concerned about that

2077
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:57,360
attack

2078
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,920
i see ben is in the queue so let's talk

2079
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,239
about it

2080
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,719
sure but as a matter of threat modeling

2081
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,239
i i

2082
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,440
have assumed that any adversary who is

2083
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,159
capable

2084
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:14,719
of um of selectively dropping packets on

2085
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,400
the network is also capable

2086
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,800
of injecting packets and therefore they

2087
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,600
are

2088
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,239
the the your the attacker you described

2089
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,760
is the persistent attacker

2090
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:27,520
is that the oh okay so that's the case

2091
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,760
um and so we're already hosed um

2092
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,800
but um that's that's not the only

2093
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,159
possible threat model but that's the

2094
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:37,520
drug model that i've been

2095
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,040
working with in my head um

2096
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,159
right the concern that like

2097
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,199
that could also happen by accident um

2098
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:51,199
i could end up not getting the response

2099
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:53,679
um because there's packet loss or some

2100
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:56,159
other thing and

2101
01:23:56,159 --> 01:23:59,280
uh sure um

2102
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,920
right i mean you know dns does have

2103
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,960
retry

2104
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,960
it doesn't uh you know it doesn't just

2105
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,719
try once and fail

2106
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:10,639
but um but that's a

2107
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,719
that's a certainly a point a reasonable

2108
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,080
point you could have you could have a 20

2109
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:17,519
second outage

2110
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,679
and and that would have some some effect

2111
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:23,199
on the client state machine that i think

2112
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:24,800
probably is not well described in the

2113
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,440
current text

2114
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,199
we can we can certainly think about how

2115
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:31,920
to provide

2116
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,239
better guidance there so you briefly

2117
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,639
discussed ratcheting up to a stronger

2118
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:37,440
trust

2119
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,120
level and that's a that's certainly an

2120
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,520
interesting idea

2121
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,120
um uh it might be helpful ben

2122
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,360
if you could actually wrapped up for us

2123
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,120
your your threat models that you're

2124
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,679
working with when you're evaluating

2125
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,159
sure i mean i i do think that the i do

2126
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,520
think that the text

2127
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:58,960
um attempts attempts to do that

2128
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,000
um i

2129
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,080
uh i guess i you know i would if people

2130
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,000
want more detail i would encourage them

2131
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,480
to

2132
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,199
to review the text specifically and and

2133
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:10,320
if they think there's

2134
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,239
a missing element there then we can

2135
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,879
certainly add it

2136
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,600
on the topic of ratcheting up i guess

2137
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,120
there's an interesting sort of broader

2138
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:20,639
use case question here

2139
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,400
you know can you imagine connecting to a

2140
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,239
network and

2141
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,719
at some point you know surfacing to the

2142
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,400
user hey it looks like

2143
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,080
this network is is using

2144
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,280
verizon fios secure dns

2145
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,600
do you want to always use verizon fios

2146
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,199
secure dns

2147
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,199
when you're on this network um

2148
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:45,120
and then you know user enables and now

2149
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,400
you're you're somehow

2150
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,560
how locked in into a more secure

2151
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,400
configuration

2152
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,000
i hadn't hadn't really considered that

2153
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,600
use case

2154
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,440
right and i think that also works to you

2155
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,600
know the implementations that do have

2156
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,080
lists of things that they recognize as

2157
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,320
risk

2158
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,560
you cut off tommy

2159
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,880
yep that was me deco um i was just gonna

2160
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:11,679
say

2161
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:14,639
um we do have examples of

2162
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,239
implementations that have lists of

2163
01:26:16,239 --> 01:26:18,000
resolvers that they trust or have used

2164
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,719
previously

2165
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,080
um and maybe those ones are

2166
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:25,760
opportunities to be a bit more sticky

2167
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:27,890
thank you tommy elliott lear please

2168
01:26:27,890 --> 01:26:30,400
[Music]

2169
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,560
hi there um okay so two points first

2170
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,639
um i like the idea of ratcheting up but

2171
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,000
as that sounds like a draft into itself

2172
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,920
which somebody could write and when they

2173
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,600
do write it it would be useful

2174
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,880
to look at two different use cases the

2175
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,880
ratcheting up where there is um a common

2176
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,080
uh user interface your your phone or

2177
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,199
your laptop

2178
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:58,639
and the more uh in the uh and the iot

2179
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:00,639
use case where if it's a wearable or

2180
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:01,840
something like that where it doesn't

2181
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,199
really have a convenient

2182
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:05,040
user interface what would be the

2183
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,400
recommendations uh

2184
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:09,600
there the second point i have is um

2185
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,520
i think these conversations in open mic

2186
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,960
would really do better

2187
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,400
um in having been prepared for uh

2188
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,400
on the agenda so that everybody because

2189
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,440
otherwise it seems like we're all

2190
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,159
winging it here

2191
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,600
uh yes i'll observe um in part that

2192
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,080
ecker also was kind of uh dual booked

2193
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:28,639
for

2194
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:30,560
meetings during this session and he's in

2195
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,159
the queue but before we move on i want

2196
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,080
to address that specific comment

2197
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,600
um we had anticipated that some of the

2198
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,360
earlier discussion was going to take

2199
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,920
longer and that we wouldn't be

2200
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:45,199
filling a full hour of open mic time

2201
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,520
um i do agree with you that we're

2202
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,000
probably not focused uh enough

2203
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,600
on this and um we

2204
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,280
might be heading toward giving you back

2205
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,880
some time before the end of the session

2206
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,320
but now that ecker is back

2207
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,400
we certainly want to hear his comments

2208
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:06,080
well thank you um i guess i i'm i'm i'm

2209
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,520
personally a little skeptical

2210
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:10,960
of the um you know the uh uh

2211
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,280
the you're on a you know network of this

2212
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,400
type um

2213
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:15,840
uh you always want to do this in the

2214
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,159
future um that we found we found

2215
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,120
attempting to determine what kind of

2216
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,560
network people are on

2217
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,000
and then precision those things fairly

2218
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,239
fraught and in particular it seems like

2219
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:26,880
um like it's not quite clear to me how

2220
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,000
that really

2221
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,719
works because the the attacker is like

2222
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,080
quite likely to take control off the

2223
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:32,719
network

2224
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:34,560
to attempt to impersonate you to claim

2225
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,920
you're not in on the network where

2226
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:36,560
you've just

2227
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:37,920
ratcheted up so i'm not really sure how

2228
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,840
that works so well i understand

2229
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,040
certainly the desire to just kind of

2230
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,000
tofu i'm not i'm not

2231
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,440
i think i understand the mechanics

2232
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,960
better before i be pretty optimistic

2233
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:56,719
about it record

2234
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:00,080
um i'm gonna toss it back to glenn now

2235
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,440
to see whether he kind of

2236
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,520
agrees with the conclusion that we've

2237
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:04,480
probably done

2238
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,040
about all the useful work that we can do

2239
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:07,520
on

2240
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,480
unprompted here in the working group and

2241
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,280
um

2242
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,560
we'll probably move towards the close of

2243
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,520
the agenda yeah that sounds perfect um

2244
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,800
good morning everybody

2245
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,199
so um i think this is the most subdued

2246
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:21,360
i've ever seen add i think it may be

2247
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:24,000
a factor of the early morning uh here on

2248
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
the west coast

2249
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,280
before you go on glenn uh daniel has a

2250
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,360
comment so let's uh give a chance for

2251
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,839
that please

2252
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,560
yeah hi um i just want to

2253
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,800
to understand why eckerd does not think

2254
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,960
that um

2255
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,239
any user interaction is um possible or

2256
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:49,760
likely to happen is that um

2257
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,920
a problem of interface that are missing

2258
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,840
or is that that we

2259
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,080
cannot rely on the end user or um

2260
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,760
yeah that's uh basically i'd like to

2261
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,280
understand a little bit more

2262
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,280
um what he thinks why he thinks um

2263
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,159
those kind of interactions not possible

2264
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:08,480
sure

2265
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,480
and i can try again um so as i

2266
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:11,840
understand the setting

2267
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,040
is that i joined network one and it's

2268
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,480
and and i discovered that there's a

2269
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,840
secure resolver on network one and then

2270
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,120
i get some interface that says

2271
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:22,320
hey if you um you're a network one do

2272
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,199
you want to like permanently use the

2273
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:24,800
security over on network one

2274
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,960
and um so i think there's several

2275
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,480
problems here one is

2276
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,840
actually determining which network on

2277
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:30,960
you're on turns out to be like really

2278
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:32,480
kind of annoying and difficult and we

2279
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,520
struggle with that a lot

2280
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,360
um and so we have a lot of heuristics

2281
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,960
around it but like we'd be reluctant to

2282
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,560
pin on that until we can be absolutely

2283
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:39,360
certain

2284
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,600
um the second is that an attacker who

2285
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:42,960
controls that network

2286
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,600
the network you join um seems likely to

2287
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,040
be able to pretend you're not on network

2288
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,560
one and so in the precise case when

2289
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,520
you're you know when you need the

2290
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:50,960
security this is the attacker will be

2291
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:51,920
able to downgrade you

2292
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,440
so i'm not sure how that works either so

2293
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:54,880
i mean i'm not saying this can't be

2294
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,560
can't be done maybe someone has like an

2295
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:57,679
idea that would work and i'm

2296
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,199
totally open to it but those are those

2297
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:00,560
are the things i would be looking for to

2298
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,840
evaluate such an idea

2299
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,159
thank you ecker daniel do you oh okay

2300
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:17,040
fred baker please

2301
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,280
this video is coming online now that

2302
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,080
i've got my

2303
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,679
computer configured to actually do the

2304
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:23,520
right thing um

2305
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,639
i'm with ecker on this the um

2306
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,719
one question that i would ask that uh

2307
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,120
so daniel commented you know so he's

2308
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,679
worried about end user behavior

2309
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:38,480
in at least 50 percent of cases the end

2310
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,920
user is going to be a

2311
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,920
computer that is being accessed by

2312
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,440
somebody else

2313
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,679
uh and i think it's quite going to be

2314
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:46,960
quite common to have

2315
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,440
the the user of the service be a

2316
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,280
computer at each end of things or a

2317
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,120
computer process

2318
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,400
so i i would not focus on

2319
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,280
asking a person to do something i would

2320
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:02,080
focus on having some kind of policy

2321
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:06,639
that that a user might apply

2322
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:11,760
thank you fred thank you tommy baldy

2323
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,840
please

2324
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:17,920
yeah i mean i think this will probably

2325
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,280
this is just agreeing with what fred

2326
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:19,920
said um

2327
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,840
i just want to be clear that when i was

2328
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,520
describing before kind of ratcheting up

2329
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,679
the security i i don't think

2330
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,679
that basing this on any type of ui

2331
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:29,280
interaction is probably the right

2332
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,400
direction

2333
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,639
like so far the only example i can think

2334
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,239
of where it's a very clear case is that

2335
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:36,159
we should allow

2336
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:40,000
an implementation to say that if i have

2337
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,480
you know insecurely discovered a

2338
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,239
particular resolver that i

2339
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:46,800
already have an affinity to and i trust

2340
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,920
that i do not need to

2341
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,560
reprobe every five minutes let's say or

2342
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,360
allow that to be downgraded

2343
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,520
if it is working fine and i already have

2344
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,960
a strong

2345
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:01,120
um reason to use it

2346
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,239
so i think we can come up with other

2347
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,560
mechanisms but

2348
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:08,239
i i think that trying to dive into ui

2349
01:33:08,239 --> 01:33:08,560
here

2350
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,320
is um a dangerous route

2351
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:17,520
okay uh thank you tommy terry please

2352
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:22,159
so i think if you look at the

2353
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:24,080
resolver attestation information that we

2354
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,679
had in the draft it talks about

2355
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,360
cryptographic assertions

2356
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,600
uh that would prove that it's it's

2357
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,600
actually hosted by

2358
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,639
a legal entity and that doesn't require

2359
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:37,040
any ui and the client can make a

2360
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,000
decision whether

2361
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,800
uh it's actually hosted by an attacker

2362
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,040
or

2363
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,040
legal entity but yeah the legal entity

2364
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,120
could itself be having a bad privacy

2365
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,639
policy and it could be smoking on the

2366
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:47,600
data but

2367
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,320
uh it reduces the threat vectors where

2368
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,280
uh

2369
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:53,520
it's very easy in today's world for an

2370
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,320
attacker to get

2371
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,920
uh you know a public ip or a domain and

2372
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:58,719
just host

2373
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,480
a server and act as an evil twin or

2374
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,719
uh compromise one of the devices and

2375
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,639
host an encrypted dns server so

2376
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:08,320
it at least addresses those kind of

2377
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:09,920
scenarios and uh

2378
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,280
uh and it does not involve any

2379
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,639
uh ui so it did work even for headless

2380
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:19,840
iot devices

2381
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,239
thank you cheer

2382
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,920
okay i think that's it okay everybody

2383
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,480
uh so

2384
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:32,560
the loss that i'll share before we let

2385
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,560
everybody go we have not yet

2386
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,400
planned out any kind of interim meeting

2387
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,360
between itf 110 and its 111.

2388
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,760
um so stay tuned there's been some

2389
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:42,639
discussion but

2390
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,119
at this point no plans have been laid

2391
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,119
down so nothing to announce there

2392
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:50,239
uh and then the rest of it i'll say uh

2393
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,239
as we're moving into the phase where we

2394
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:53,920
have we now have two working group

2395
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,600
documents that have been adopted

2396
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,920
uh for active work we've got one adopted

2397
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,639
for informational purposes uh

2398
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,719
those are hosted in the group's

2399
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:08,400
github uh repositories but let's

2400
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,920
make an extra effort because i and this

2401
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,199
has been discussed on the list but i

2402
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:12,800
wanted to sort of say to the group

2403
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,639
let's make sure we make a conscious

2404
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,119
effort to keep the discussions active

2405
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:20,480
on the list and not just slip because

2406
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:22,400
it would be easy to do slip into doing

2407
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,600
everything over on

2408
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,679
github because that includes people and

2409
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:26,800
it doesn't allow for

2410
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:29,360
full participation by the group so just

2411
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:31,040
be conscious of it and make an extra

2412
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,760
effort to be

2413
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,080
extra verbose onto the list about this

2414
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:34,880
stuff

2415
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:39,360
so thank you any last words uh david or

2416
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,000
eric

2417
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,719
and none for me give eric a chance to

2418
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:46,719
buzz in

2419
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:49,679
nothing on my side

2420
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,920
okay well then good uh good day

2421
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,960
everybody and we'll

2422
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:57,840
we'll see you at itf 111 if not before

2423
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
bye
