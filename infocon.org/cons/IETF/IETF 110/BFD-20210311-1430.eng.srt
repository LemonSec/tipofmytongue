1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,639
i don't see share application okay

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,240
yeah so when i click on the share icon

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,920
what i see is share screen it's like do

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,920
you really want to share

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,600
it's like you were sharing earlier okay

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,880
with some incoming share screen

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
browser are you using

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,119
i'm on safari that's your problem

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
um for whatever reason at least as of

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,680
the last ietf

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,520
you couldn't share anything other than

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
your full screen with safari

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,280
okay let me uh okay

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
and if you're using uh so i think that

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
both chrome and firefox are known to

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,199
work well

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,039
um you do end up having to enable the

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,960
allow screen recording or something like

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
that um in the security part of the

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,719
settings

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,400
which then requires you to restart the

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,199
browser also

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,520
okay do you guys see what i'm sharing

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,960
now

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,320
yeah if you maximize that it should be

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,320
fine

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,390
okay

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,549
[Music]

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,119
icon at the bottom right of the screen

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,560
it looks like a

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,520
little plug-in thing add to your left

32
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
nope keep slide your left keep going

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,759
keep going

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
one of those two there you go so that's

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,560
normal slice order i think the next one

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
over is the full size

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
so two icons to the right

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
no no no not the slider

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,159
there are four there are four buttons

40
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,600
there what yeah the slide show one

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,399
left to the slider oops

42
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,399
you've stopped the screecher actually i

43
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,840
think we lost him completely

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
i will look for the chair slides just in

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,839
case uh i have to do the projection

46
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,560
so rashad if you like i can go ahead and

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,239
run the screen if you

48
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,840
would like me to do that

49
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:33,839
and by the way you're still on mute

50
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,920
okay jeff you can share because it looks

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
like i'm having i mean i don't want to

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
change to chrome now

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,480
okay in the middle so i'll take notes

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,840
okay that'll work

55
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
should we get going yeah

56
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,519
yeah and actually just before we get

57
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,280
completely started is there anybody that

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,080
like to check

59
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,439
tester microphone to make sure that

60
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,320

okay since nobody is actually asking

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
and it looks like we can see full screen

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,880

childhood or something along those lines

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,319

okay here's an update on uh the

105
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,039
documents we have in urfc rfc 8971 which

106
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
is bfd for vxlan

107
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,960
would like to thank everybody who

108
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,120
contributed reviewed the authors and a

109
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,720
special thanks to greg for

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,919
pushing it over the finish line which

111
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,000
is always a tough job

112
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,800
bfd for large packets um

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
there's been discussions there's been a

114
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,560
relate that was

115
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
in uh working group last call there's

116
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,080
been

117
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,319
a um a more recent draft regarding how

118
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:14,720
to

119
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
other if you guys remember but bfd

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
large packets allows you to have large

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
packets to detect mtu

122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,039
issues but it doesn't address procedures

123
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,400
to alter

124
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,520
the uh bfd padding size and that draft

125
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,520
bf debating alteration describes

126
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
procedures to do so

127
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
the authors have decided to merge

128
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
documents together that's a good that's

129
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
a good idea

130
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
and i guess we're basically waiting for

131
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,720
a new revision of the document

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,360
very quickly that is my near term queue

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
after ietf is finished

134
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,319
thank you um

135
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,919
bfd yang document it's been a while uh

136
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,319
we've had to send diffs to the rfc

137
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,639
editor do a change in one of the modules

138
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,080
it depends on

139
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,199
the t's yankee that document has been in

140
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,319
miss ref for

141
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,360
close to three years now uh i haven't

142
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,319
checked what

143
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,280
are the state of the other documents i

144
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
mean the ones it depends on

145
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,360
so i don't have a good idea what a

146
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,400
potential eta would be

147
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
so a quick point on this one it was

148
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
mentioned in one of the other meetings

149
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,960
uh this week

150
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,039
i have to pull my notes to exactly which

151
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,120
one i think was in the chat

152
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,799
that one of the options we could

153
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,880
consider doing to maybe move things

154
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
forward is to

155
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,320
uh take the document back from the rfc

156
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
editor and split out the mpls component

157
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,559
and ship it without the mpls component

158
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
in the main document and do a second

159
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,680
document with mpls

160
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,519
i'm not saying this is a good or bad

161
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,800
idea it is

162
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,080
just potentially an option for the

163
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
working group if we care to get

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
ourselves unstuck from mpls

165
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,000
or alternatively we ask our ads to lean

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,440
on the mpls group to finish their work

167
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
hello jeff that was me who suggested

168
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,800
that this ac

169
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,519
and lsi suggest that in lsr because i

170
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,080
had done

171
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
i had done some homework and i saw that

172
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,680
not only are you work

173
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,959
waiting on yang te you're waiting on

174
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
yang t-e-r-s-v-p

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
which t e references so you got to get

176
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,040
both of those done

177
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
just to get that one reference to the

178
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,560
tunnels

179
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
or those i mean those those references

180
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,920
to the tunnels in

181
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
the mpls document

182
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
thank you ac i'd forgotten that uh it

183
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
was you yeah um

184
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
so and i think uh part of the relevant

185
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
point here since was mentioned lsr is

186
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
that uh

187
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
we're also holding up other people that

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
are importing the module that we asked

189
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
them to use as the grouping to make

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
you know life consistent for the rest of

191
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
the bfd users

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
so unfortunately what we're trying to do

193
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,200
the right thing for everybody

194
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,560
mpls is sort of messing that up

195
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,560
yeah so we'll sync up after i did not

196
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
attend the uh where that was said i

197
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,000
think it's something of the but it's a

198
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
suggestion to be considered

199
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,399
i think next in the queue is mahesh okay

200
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,240
uh so richard and jeff actually

201
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,200
i did have an opportunity when i was

202
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
writing the yang module for one of our

203
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,519
drafts to actually test out

204
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
and yes richard there's a minor change

205
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,399
in the tease document

206
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,160
which i was able to address by changing

207
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,320
the pft module to get it to compile

208
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,519
but i do second the fact that we

209
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,680
might want to split off mpls just to get

210
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
the rest of the

211
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,640
the pft yang module

212
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,360
out of the door

213
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,000
okay

214
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,000
sorry about that

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,680
yeah i'll just add i i would i would

216
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,959
hold you know you're holding it's

217
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,880
holding up uh

218
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,200
ospf isis and pm at least

219
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
okay

220
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
okay we'll uh sync up on that

221
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
and my is the fix you have to do is it

222
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
do you remember if it's the same fix i

223
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,480
had sent to the rfc editor

224
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,440
or should we sync up on that yeah i

225
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,120
don't remember exactly

226
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,760
what you changed i think it's uh one of

227
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
the plurals and

228
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,320
one yes there was yeah there was one

229
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,720
thing for lsps versus lsp from

230
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,600
what i remember right okay

231
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,760
um bfd unsolicited uh it's expired

232
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
recently we need eurovision there's

233
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
going to be a quick update immediately

234
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,360
after

235
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,000
the bfd authentication docs there's been

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
updates recently

237
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,720
based on the uh comments from the

238
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,360
shepherd

239
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,680
we should be done working group last

240
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,360
call soon there's going to be an update

241
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,639
on two of the documents

242
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,399
after i think it's fairly minor

243
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,760
minor stuff left well the document has

244
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,880
come a long way

245
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
i think we're close to being

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
there yes greg

247
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,959
i'm premature so for the development of

248
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,519
interest

249
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,440
comment okay okay um

250
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
and that was for this document of

251
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
interest you know i want to take a look

252
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,399
that i did not have time i don't think

253
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
there was any feedback

254
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,839
and i believe that's an rfc now

255
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,200
no it's a an rca editor queue so yes

256
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,720
it's got uh needed votes from

257
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,200
isg and it's uh in rfc editor q

258
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
but if i may i wanted to

259
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,240
mention other documents

260
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,839
in mpls working group

261
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,079
uh before we move on to those greg for

262
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,079
the one that's displayed here the mvp

263
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,320
and fast failover the thing that's sort

264
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,160
of an interesting sticking point on this

265
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,560
one

266
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,120
is that uh you know best is defining it

267
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
but it's sort of a core

268
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,800
php path attribute that be used to

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,440
provide

270
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,399
bfd discriminators as glue so that's one

271
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,320
of the hold up points it didn't get uh

272
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,880
you know the wider review even an idr

273
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,839
and i think the uh

274
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,959
it hasn't hit my iq as a new idr chair

275
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,399
yet but uh

276
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,839
john may have a better sense of what it

277
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,839
was last status wise

278
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,279
but uh the need for you know this being

279
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,079
a more generic

280
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
mechanism is i think one of the sticking

281
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,600
points we have to figure out what that

282
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,839
goes on with there

283
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,480
matthew did you want to respond to that

284
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
point or did you enjoy uh

285
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,600
um so speaking of specific um

286
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,000
best coaches it's currently in the rlc

287
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,360
editor's queue

288
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,920
um i believe it went through invest

289
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,079
mostly because it's fairly specific to

290
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,519
or is considered fairly specific to

291
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
to um to vpns

292
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
but that may be you know some people

293
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,839
have different different opinions on

294
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
that but i'm not sure

295
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,360
um stefan my co-chair was actually

296
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
shepherding it so i don't know if he's

297
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,079
tracked the

298
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,120
he's not in this call um

299
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,560
attract any of those issues that you

300
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,600
mentioned more closely

301
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,519
yeah i don't know that there's serious

302
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,959
issues i did leave some specific

303
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,839
comments uh

304
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,360
you know as part of my own review of the

305
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
thing um

306
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,839
and that was before i took on the chair

307
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,959
job so i think a conversation will you

308
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,320
know probably need we need to close off

309
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,000
on those points minimally the

310
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,839
point libraries need to be addressed and

311
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,199
past that point

312
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,279
more eyes um

313
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,720
as editor of this document i hope that i

314
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,079
addressed your comments

315
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,839
so yes i appreciate if you can check

316
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,320

so my interruption being done uh greg

319

320
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,839
bring to attention

321
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,959
uh yes um so

322
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
there is a one mpls working group

323
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,440
document

324
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,199
um it's

325
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,320
bfd directed um

326
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,399
for traffic engineering environment or

327
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
path engineered environments

328
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,000
what it does it extends

329
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,600
mpls lsp ping

330
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,519
that can direct their reverse

331
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,639
path for their bfd session or

332
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,040
path for the reverse direction of the

333
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
session

334
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,040
uh to this specific um

335
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,199

and how to handle it for

348
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
uh

349

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,919
encasion's point to my point in what

353
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,679
working group is it

354
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
mdls working group mpls working group

355
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,280
okay

356
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,199
and you mentioned the previous one the

357
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,880
uh

358
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,280
the um bfd okay directed is stuck um

359
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,520
in in what it's stuck in what state now

360
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
and for what reason

361
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,039
uh okay it had um

362
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
wrote a routine directorate review

363
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
uh there were some comments uh the

364
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
technical comments

365
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,679
uh i believe that uh these technical

366
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,799
comments

367
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,520
uh have been addressed um

368
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,840
but reviewer believes otherwise

369
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,520
and we're kind of stuck

370
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,720
uh in our own opinions

371
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,840
um mpls working group seems

372
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,240
um

373
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,160
ambivalent to that so i

374
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
hope that um

375
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,720
i know uh i recall that uh

376
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,000
jeff looked at this uh draft and

377
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,080
shared his uh expert opinion

378
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
on uh working group chair

379
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,400
but i don't think that it really was

380
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,039
uh accepted because it was not on the

381
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,240
mailing list

382
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,160
it was a small group discussing

383
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
so uh if um somebody

384
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
or some experts from the group can share

385
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,679
their opinion

386
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
on mpl's uh mailing list

387
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,360
whether it's uh useful whether it's a

388
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,360
reasonable solution i would greatly

389
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,080
appreciate that

390
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,360

395
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,720
just giving a quick update on this

396
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,679
document on behalf of all the authors

397
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,559
next slide please

398
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,840
so here's

399
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,240
that's a recap of the current state of

400
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,559
the document

401
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,840
it was last presented at itf 104 so

402
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,320
exactly two years ago

403
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,439
we had added a yang model

404
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,799
for this feature you know when when the

405
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,360
document was adopted we had a young

406
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
doctor review which required a small

407
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,640
change in the

408
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,120
main bfd young model that was sent to

409
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,840
the rfc edit that was sent to the

410
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,880
rfc editor and because of the yang model

411
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,200
we change the document from

412
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
informational to standards

413
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,200
uh we'll talk about that on the next

414
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
slide and then

415
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,960
uh working group last call was um

416
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
was requested last august

417
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,520
next slide please

418
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
so we the main comments we got during

419
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
the last call was

420
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,720
um on the comments one of the few

421
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,760
comments we got from raj was to

422
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,080
make sure that the procedures described

423
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
worked on

424
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,039
unnumbered interfaces uh we

425
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,159
the authors need to address this uh the

426
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,360
comments were i think

427
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,120
yeah specific to the subnet check and

428
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,880
the source address

429
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
for uh lookup so that's something which

430
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,760
we did not give reply to

431
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,960
and we have to we have to look into and

432
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,600
update

433
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,120
the document accordingly um

434
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,799
the other uh discussion which happened i

435
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,120
believe from uh

436
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,760
that got started by less i believe was

437
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,400
all the

438
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,240
well the two were related was first

439
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
whether the yang should be in the same

440
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,360
document

441
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,200
as the future the consensus seems to be

442
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,240
to keep the yang

443
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,039
in the document then the next related

444
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,880
question was whether it should be

445
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,039
informational um there was no consensus

446
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,520
here

447
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,080
uh and there seems to be i had sent an

448
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,640
email

449
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
to the ops ads

450
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,559
rob wilton replied i think i got reply

451
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,200
from somebody else i forget who

452
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
there seems to be no itf rules as to

453
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
whether having a yang requires the dock

454
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,360
to be standard struck

455
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
personally i don't really mind either

456
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,480
way

457
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,520
whether it's informational or standards

458
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,039
tracked

459
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,720
i know there was a push to keep it

460
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,559
informational because there's no

461
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,000
protocol changers there but there is a

462
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,559
yang

463
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,760
okay model so john we may need your

464
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,679
well not me we will need your help just

465
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,559
to close on this

466
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,440
and also got comments from greg uh there

467
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
were some clarifications

468
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,120
so one of the reasons just i mean for

469
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
informational purposes one of the

470
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,280
reasons this document stalled

471
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,840
was uh three of the full authors changed

472
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,200
jobs in the past year or so

473
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,039
so we need to get back to it

474
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,919
next slide please

475
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,679
yeah we need to address the comments

476
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,799
from the bfd

477
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,840
working group and

478
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
move ahead with it but the main thing

479
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
you know from a non-technical

480
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,799
uh viewpoint is we need to address the

481
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,760
uh

482
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,360
standards track versus informational

483
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,720
and thankfully this document is

484
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,799
literally at the the last gates now it's

485
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,919
ready to be published once those are

486
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,520
dealt with

487
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,320
john yeah comment

488
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,039
enough for me to be educated about the

489
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,400
standards correct versus

490
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,919
uh informational i have a question

491
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
which is um what's the downside of

492
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,679
moving it forward as standards correct

493
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,720
from your perspective

494
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,840
because that would appear to address the

495
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,880
ambiguity

496
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,159
by making it move

497
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,760
if you'd rather take it to a side

498
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,320
conversation that's perfectly fine i i

499
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,840
think the general consensus

500
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,720
from the working group is their

501
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
ambivalent about uh what the actual

502
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,640
status of this is

503
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,120
uh originally without the ang module

504
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,720
there is absolutely no protocol change

505
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,840
this is more about

506
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,679
here's how you use existing mechanisms

507
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,279
mostly via configuration

508
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,080
and that sort of thing so that was the

509
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,720
real reason to have it informational

510
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,600
and the ambiguity is strictly what does

511
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
having a yang module inside of your

512
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,320
document

513
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,679
do to things uh

514
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,760
the the question effectively devolves

515
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,919
down to we're polluting the ietf

516
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,520
namespace for modules by putting our

517
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,640
stuff in there

518
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,200
and ietf effectively has to manage that

519
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
so while we're not changing bfd

520
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,080
we're changing the yang tree that ietf

521
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,279
as a whole manages

522
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,799
so i think that's really what the

523
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,720
question evolves to

524
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,840
it doesn't hurt us to have it as

525
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,679
standards track and i think we just need

526
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:10,159
a

527
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,120
declaration right yeah i get the reason

528
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,240
why um

529
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,320
the the you know bfd may pull standards

530
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,760
crack in with it i'm

531
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,360
just trying to understand why the

532
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
working group wouldn't just say

533
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,279
okay find standards track but as i said

534
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:29,840
we can take it offline

535
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,600
further questions before we move to next

536
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,000
slides

537
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,840
okay secure sequence numbers will be up

538
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:57,840
next as soon as i find it

539
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,960
all right uh so i will be presenting

540
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,279
secure sequence numbers on behalf of

541
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,080
sonal

542
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,279
who could not attend this particular

543
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,200
meeting

544
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,000
next slide please

545
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,960
so as rashad mentioned in the

546
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,080
chest status we've been going through

547
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,600
trying to address the itches addressed

548
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,880
now i think there's still a

549
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,919
couple of minor comments still left

550
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,960
uh which i think we will address in the

551
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,799
next revision

552
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,279
um so we should the latest version

553
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,679
should be bumped up to online after

554
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,440
its 10 110

555
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,840
next slide

556
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,120
so one of the questions that was raised

557
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,320
as a result

558
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,279
of the shepherd's comments was has to do

559
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,480
with

560
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,760
the fact that we do talk about

561
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,440
symmetric algorithm that is used to

562
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,720
compute the ciphertext for this sequence

563
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,640
number itself

564
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,640
um the suggestion from richard was

565
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,159
whether we should mandate or even

566
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,279
propose actually

567
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,640
uh a minimum algorithm i don't remember

568
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
richard which is the one you

569
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,440
maybe said as the minimum

570
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,799
um that we might want to propose

571
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,600
in the draft for the purpose of

572
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,720
interoperability um that of course

573
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,919
leaves the question of what happens

574
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,840
if that minimum algorithm ever gets

575
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,840
obsoleted or deprecated

576
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,640
um at that point would become have to

577
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,960
come back and drop the draft

578
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,159
so typically iitf has not been very good

579
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:02,720
at

580
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
being able to specify a minimum set of

581
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,000
algorithms

582
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,240
so this is a question for the work group

583
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,760
to answer and then

584
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,440
if not then um should

585
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,039
the trunk leave it to the implementers

586
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,360
to decide what algorithm they're going

587
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,080
to set up

588
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,840
as a minimum or whatever they propose

589
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,120
in their implementation so

590
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
um that's pretty much all i had and i

591
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,720
would pause and see if

592
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,320
anybody in the work repair has any

593
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,200
comments or suggestions on

594
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
how to resolve this question of

595
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
algorithm

596
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
uh personal opinion you mentioned that

597
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,240
and you're correct that this is usually

598
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,159
not done to suggesting algorithms for

599
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,080
the reason so i think i'll

600
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
if this is something which is not done

601
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,520
for the reasons you mentioned

602
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
we should probably go along the same

603
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,678
lines

604
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,000
see john john

605
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,919
it was a little thrown off when uh

606
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,200
maheshu said that

607
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,919
uh you might put an algorithm into the

608
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,559
document

609
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,399
for interoperability reasons isn't the

610
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,480
uh sequence number a local matter

611
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
the when you say local matter meaning in

612
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
terms of

613
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,000
um how you secure the sequence number

614
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,440
how you how you generate it yeah

615
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,039
that is local uh the question is if

616
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,159
uh as part of this draft a proposal if

617
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,919
you're trying to secure it

618
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,320
by uh using a symmetric algorithm

619
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,159
then both ends have to agree on that

620
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,399
algorithm oh okay yeah thank you

621
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,639
sorry

622
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
and mahesh remind me didn't we have a

623
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
conversation originally with ellen

624
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,520
decock that had recommended

625
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,240
a specific algorithm that is extremely

626
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,720
low cpu use that's uh

627
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,919
a good have a good fit for this

628
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,240
you know the i must be missing or

629
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,600
forgetting something

630
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,799
so probably will need okay let's let's

631
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,080
take that back uh

632
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,799
so the uh somewhat to john's point the

633
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,799
purpose here is to provide

634
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,000
uh the ability to do bfd security

635
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,159
when you're not actually doing

636
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,919
signatures across the entire bfd packet

637
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,399
you're just trying to

638
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,919
do something that effectively from the

639
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,520
outside world looks like a random set of

640
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,360
sequence numbers

641
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,200
and we're using a crypto mechanism to

642
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,640
basically uh

643
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,720
allow us to generate what the next

644
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,240
sequence number looks like

645
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,120
without actually doing something as

646
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,799
strong as sha2

647
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,960
and we'd received some feedback during

648
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,440
the initial discussion phases about this

649
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,240
that there exist some low-level hashes

650
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,640
that

651
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,519
are extremely cheap to run the challenge

652
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,360
is once we get to anything that's

653
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,919
too complex uh we actually get rid of

654
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,480
the bone

655
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,600
uh the benefit of this feature which was

656
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,799
intended to

657
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,320
not have to do quite as much crypto and

658
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,799
bfd

659
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
okay so i'll take that back to the

660
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,640
mailing list and see if we can contact

661
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,840
alan

662
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
um john did you want to respond to that

663
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,480
as follow-up

664
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,960
easy yeah i noticed that the

665
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,919
document when you do this you still have

666
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:40,880
to have a greater

667
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,159
sequence number than the previous so

668
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,240
anytime you do anything other than just

669
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,919
replacing it you're gonna

670
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,039
have a lot more wraps with 32-bit value

671
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,799
that's not discussed in the document

672
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,559
though

673
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,679
um so are you saying after

674
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,679
you have generated the ciphertext

675
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
version of the

676
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,600
sequence number no it's that

677
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,519
you you're taking a monotonically

678
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,399
increasing sequence number to begin with

679
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,039
and then the you're competing the

680
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,159
ciphertext for it

681
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,360
and inserting it oh okay okay

682
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,679
oh okay but okay but both sides would

683
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,919
have to use the same of course then okay

684
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,120
i understand

685
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,559
this is the obscuring mechanism

686
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,440
all right um so if there are no other

687
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,600
comments then i guess

688
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,519
jeff we're going to take it to the to

689
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,039
john and then our mailing list

690
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,120
yep well we'll take it back and again

691
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,080
the challenge is

692
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,679
we don't want to use any ciphers that

693
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,440
actually make it more expensive than

694
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,480
solving you know

695
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,799
bfd signatures at speed anyway

696
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,640
so yeah got to go back to there

697
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
is no nothing further the next schedule

698
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,919
of presentation is bfd

699
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,480
stability

700
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,640
this should also be a fairly short

701
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,440
presentation

702
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,559
so um next slide

703
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,880
so just like um secure sequence number

704
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,000
this one is uh

705
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,960
also gone through the shepherd's review

706
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,240
uh one of the questions

707
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,320
that came back during that review

708
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,360
process from

709
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,120
albert was that the draft mentioned

710
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,960
being able to track the lost packet

711
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,320
count

712
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,399
but there was nothing described in the

713
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,720
draft as to how that

714
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,840
could potentially be tracked um

715
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,559
so the suggestion was maybe it needs a

716
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,240
young model

717
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,279
which is uh next slide

718
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,840
which is exactly what we added

719
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,079
so it essentially extends

720
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,918
the idf yang model

721
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,918
to add iftf bft stability

722
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,440
um documents for each

723
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,560
one of the potential uses of pft

724
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,800
in this case what you're seeing is an

725
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,760
example for

726
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,440
a single up ip bft

727
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,719
where it's adding a lost packet count

728
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,440
a very fairly small yang module but it

729
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,639
does require

730
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,839
i guess now a young doctor's review

731
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,440
which i think richard has already

732
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,199
initiated

733
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,239
and it also mis

734
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,440
necessitated an update to the ayana

735
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
consideration section

736
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,359
and the security consideration section

737
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,560
so those

738
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,680
were the changes for this particular

739
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,200
draft

740
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,919
any questions

741
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,200
i took a look but i don't remember is

742
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,640
there a feature

743
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,400
defined for this counter or is it i'm

744
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,240
not saying we have to i'm

745
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,959
i'm just curious

746
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,400
well um good point it's the only thing

747
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,119
that is

748
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,320
there in the yang modules so either you

749
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,920
implement the yang module and you have

750
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,400
the capability i guess you don't

751
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,680
okay okay question

752
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,599
even so wouldn't you want to see this in

753
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,440
your netconf hello to

754
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,800
know that the module is present

755
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,320
um right so if you're

756
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,320
even implemented in that case it's

757
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,680
sorry maybe you can clarify

758
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,359
well sorry i didn't mean to keep in

759
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,040
trouble just saying i mean if the

760
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,119
i mean if you don't support i think what

761
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,320
you were implying

762
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
my ish was if you don't support this

763
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,599
then you don't

764
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,359
there's one counter so if you don't

765
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,800
implement this

766
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,000
you don't that module would not be

767
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,320
in the yang library and all that right

768
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,160
and whereas if you do it's the only

769
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,800
counter

770
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,200
that's what you were implying that is

771
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,160
good

772
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,560
okay okay the yang library

773
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,839
considerations were the ones i wasn't

774
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,839
thinking of thank you

775
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,880
okay i believe this takes us to our last

776
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,680
presentation

777
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:41,839
which is bfd unaffiliated

778
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:09,839
okay watching

779
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,119
hello could you hear me yes

780
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,079
excuse me ciao created me

781
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,040
yes we can hear you

782
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,839
so next page

783
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,720
yeah this is uh the intention of this

784
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,280
draft

785
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,640
because there are some people

786
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,560
uh asking uh some questions

787
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,320
so we would like to clarify those

788
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,040
questions

789
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,400
here uh and uh

790
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,599
this is uh a new use that

791
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,720
is not yet been documented

792
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,760
in the current offices and

793
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,119
the second one is a ppi for tr

794
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,940
114 6

795
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,440
[Music]

796
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,800
documented the similar use

797
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,480
but in that tr the detailed

798
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,240
procedural text is not clear

799
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,079
and the third point is this draft

800
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,680
adopted by pfd looking group

801
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,760
last year due to the fact that

802
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,599
this draft updates ifc

803
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,119
58 80

804
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,200
in many aspects so the

805
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,880
intended status exchange

806
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:01,359
to the standard track next page

807
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,560
so uh the main change uh from uh

808
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,320
last revision uh the first point is that

809
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
add a new

810
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,280
session two to list all updates to

811
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,960
rfc 5880

812
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,240
the second add more

813
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,440
details on procedures

814
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,200
into section 3. the third one

815
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,240
improve the section four on the

816
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,960
application applicability

817
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,160
of a uniquely data

818
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,280
bfd ico functions

819
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
the last one added a new section 8

820
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,880
to list contributors and

821
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,800
we move one course to contribute because

822
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,560
the number limitation for the courses

823
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,279
next page

824
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,800
yeah this page gives the details

825
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,760
updates to fc

826
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,240
5880 so the first

827
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,359
point is uh the bfd ico

828
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,119
functions is uh a drink

829
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,119
to bfd asynchronous

830
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,880
model or bfd demand model

831
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,720
but it in this chapter

832
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,040
uh on a fleet kitted

833
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,960
bfd ico removes this

834
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,880
restriction as a second point

835
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,160
in previous rpc before

836
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,760
the bfdi code function work

837
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,359
the non-zero required minimum

838
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,119
i call x must be signaled

839
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,839
by the remote system uh this dropped

840
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,440
the uh on

841
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,040
afflicted vfdi code removes

842
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,560
this signaling uh procedure

843
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,079
and the third one the bfd ico

844
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,599
packets must not be

845
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,440
transmitted when bfd session status

846
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,119
is not up in this draft

847
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,839
the bfdi code removes the

848
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,839
limitation and the next page

849
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,920
and this page

850
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,640
this slide gives a detailed

851
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,200
procedure in this draft

852
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,240
firstly the

853
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,680
device a creator

854
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,160
the session and

855
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,599
it will settle

856
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,640
such as a transmit interval and

857
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,240
the detector mode

858
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,959
and the second

859
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,000
point the device a will send

860
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,400
the packet reusing the bfd control

861
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,000
packet format

862
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,240
to one hope we device b

863
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,400
with the ip address destinated

864
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,920
for itself so the ttl may be

865
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,839
set to

866
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,000
the the maximum number

867
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,040
the destination udp port

868
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,340
is cited to

869
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,839
[Music]

870
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,800
37 85

871
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,720
and the

872
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,760
the the next action the device b

873
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,440
will look back the received bfd

874
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,119
ico packets by the normal

875
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,760
forwarding wii without any special

876
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,880
processing and

877
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,119
the last step the device a

878
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,200
will receive the the bfd

879
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,440
ico packet and

880
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,800
lead to bfd change

881
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,560
so this is a very simple

882
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,160
procedure next page

883
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,079
so currently we have a tune i'm sorry to

884
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:54,400
play

885
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,319
to interrupt i think greg has a question

886
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,160
and if it's one on the on one of the

887
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,839
previous slides greg so yeah gregor

888
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:02,880
cases oh that's

889
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,240
another question it's um something i i

890
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,520
wanted to note

891
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,800
and uh we discussed it before so

892
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,319
uh the updates that you are listed

893
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,680
for um that this document

894
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,160
uh updates 58.80 um

895
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
my concern is that it affects the

896
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,800
security considerations because

897
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,240
uh the reason for this uh restrictions

898
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,240
put in 5880 uh

899
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,839
to use um echo function

900
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,520
was for the uh remote ad and

901
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,440
to be able to uh either

902
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,480
uh regulate uh their rate

903
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,880
of echo packets transmitted to it

904
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,920
or even

905
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,960
not to accept them at all

906
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,079
so for example by setting this

907
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,200
value to zero it indicates that

908
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,920
the remote pier doesn't want to receive

909
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,640
any

910
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,280
echo packet so uh removing this

911
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,280
and allowing to start

912
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,359
transmitting echo packets without

913
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,520
reaching the up state

914
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,400
during the normal um pole sequence

915
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,040
uh creates an opportunity for anybody to

916
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,920
start sending

917
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,040
at any rate packets

918
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,160
uh to their um system bfd system that

919
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,118
cannot handle it

920
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,440
yeah understand so maybe we need and

921
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,800
some note to describe the risk

922
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,079
right yeah uh and uh

923
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,359
to the procedure so um you probably

924
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,400
didn't include

925
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,880
in the slide that uh in order to

926
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,560
use returned packet

927
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,040
packets

928
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,599
your discriminator and progress the

929
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,400
status to

930
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,079
up uh these fields has to be initialized

931
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,400
by the sender it's uh

932
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,839
itself oh yes so basically

933
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,640
the sender has to set the status to up

934
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,200
and send the your discriminator to the

935
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,720
locally assigned

936
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,160
uh associated with this bfd session

937
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,680
uh discriminator value so

938
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,760
thus on the receipt of this packet it

939
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,079
will be able to proceed as you describe

940
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,200
it yeah so thank you

941
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,400
upon the outtake uh i think it

942
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,359
we did not release it in the slides but

943
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,040
the content you mentioned now

944
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:10,240
we documented in the draft right

945
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,599
okay okay all right casey you had a

946
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,520
question

947
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,359
just a quick one uh i've somewhat given

948
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,200
up at my own company trying to get

949
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,680
people not to write yang with a capital

950
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,079
y

951
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,319
and the rest lower case but it's yang is

952
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,480
uh is is originally an acronym

953
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,559
so could you please not use that

954
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,359
uh that version of it

955
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:39,839
okay

956
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,079
mark

957
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,760
up comments uh we got into greg's

958
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,720
comments

959
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,720
i think for this uh uh affinity pfd echo

960
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,520
process this is uh it is totally

961
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,040
transparent today

962
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,640
to the remote uh system so it's just

963
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,119
like

964
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,440
just like a data packet you don't know

965
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,480
you don't

966
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,280
know any thing about the whether it's a

967
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,559
bfd packet or

968
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,599
a data packet so same size for me as

969
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,079
there's no security issue

970
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,760
uh so i'm going to insert myself into

971
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
the queue ahead of greg uh potentially

972
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,000
make the point that greg would

973
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,359
it would be normally a security

974
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,160
consideration in the sense that

975
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,720
one of the reasons we have signaling for

976
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,160
echo support

977
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,720
is so that the systems can do regulation

978
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,319
and also indicate their willingness to

979
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,839
do so

980
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,359
the whole point of this feature

981
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,119
originally from broadband forum

982
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,160
is that there is no bfd control protocol

983
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,640
running between the two systems and

984
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,359
simple packet loopback is permitted what

985
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,480
this means is that

986
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,000
you have an unprotected system

987
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,280
so you are correct in the sense that

988
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,400
there's not much going on

989
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,839
but it's still dangerous

990
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,599
yeah i think mark

991
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,119
gives some comments

992
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,319
that if that is in normal

993
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,599
forwarding way the packet will be

994
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,640
looped back because uh

995
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,290
if the remote side just

996
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,000
[Music]

997
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,559
rotates the packet based on the ip

998
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:31,599
address

999
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,040
but there is some risk that

1000
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,440
if the remove side treated that packet

1001
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,760
as a bfd ico packet

1002
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,520
it will do some other action

1003
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,599
that that may be the risk yeah

1004
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,079
yeah in security terminology this would

1005
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,240
be considered a reflection attack

1006
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,880
so that that is the thing that the

1007
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,400
security considerations will need to

1008
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,680
discuss

1009
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,880
yeah i was dead greg

1010
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,960
uh i have a further point but greg did

1011
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,079
you want to finish one

1012
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,920
no uh thank you jeff um uh it was very

1013
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,040
uh one small note i i wanted to mention

1014
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,680
in regards to the reference to uh bdf

1015
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,040
document

1016
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:26,319
uh i discussed it with their um

1017
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,760
dbf and uh they're not really proud of

1018
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,400
this

1019
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,559
document and what is written there in

1020
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,599
regard to the

1021
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,800
bfd so they're not going to revisit it

1022
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,480
but they are not advertised

1023
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,920
and not really supportive of what's

1024
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,640
in the document in regard to bfd echo

1025
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,960
function

1026
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,680
well that is good to know it also means

1027
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,599
that they will be happy if we clean this

1028
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,440
up for them

1029
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,280
yes if we can provide some foundation

1030
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,359
uh i don't think that there will be any

1031
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,319
effort to

1032
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,160
revisit their tr 146.

1033
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,839
but yes uh they would appreciate if we

1034
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,119
provide more uh strict technical

1035
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,559
ground for this mode so greg just to

1036
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:20,559
clarify they're not proud of their

1037
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,480
document you're not referring to

1038
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,680
this no no no i i'm referring to tr

1039
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,680
uh 146 in the part that discusses bfd

1040
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,880
echo function use

1041
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,200
okay

1042
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,400
right and make one last point and then

1043
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,760
return the presentation

1044
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,599
back um using your own slide

1045
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,640
uh one of the discussion points that

1046
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,240
will need to be in the document

1047
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,040
is that uh by entering you know one of

1048
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,119
the down or in it states

1049
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,319
that normally implies that uh

1050
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,359
the bfd async mechanism

1051
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,720
is running and will be generating

1052
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,040
packets so part of our procedure changes

1053
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,880
that need to be in here

1054
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,440
is that we're allowed to be in the down

1055
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:05,920
state

1056
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,200
without transmitting packets

1057
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,760
and i'll take that comment also to the

1058
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,000
mailing list

1059
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,040
yeah thank you very much so uh

1060
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,480
could i go uh a hide for the open

1061
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,880
issues

1062
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,720
please yeah so

1063
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,920
yeah we there are still two

1064
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,559
issues uh open uh if possible we hope to

1065
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,680
uh have some discussion here the first

1066
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,880
uh

1067
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,880
issue is that

1068
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,920
printed version

1069
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,400
to reviews the both statistical machine

1070
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,000
and the multiplexing key

1071
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,480
which will simply simplify the

1072
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,920
implementation

1073
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,760
so in this draft uh the pfdi

1074
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,960
code packet reuse the

1075
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,599
bfd control packet format so

1076
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,000
we would like to know is there some

1077
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,680
other proposal

1078
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,000
and the second open issue is that

1079
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,359
i think at the beginning we talked

1080
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,480
about the bfd model

1081
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:35,040
and if possible we hope

1082
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,400
this uh the

1083
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,040
mechanism in this draft can be

1084
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,280
pfdr model also so

1085
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,480
if we

1086
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,078
decided to

1087
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:58,319
handle the bfdr model draft further

1088
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,520
i think we can consider

1089
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:11,119
this point in also thank you

1090
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,920
greg you have the mic

1091
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,000
um beijing um thank you for bringing

1092
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,240
uh this open issues um

1093
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,440
my understanding of the status of

1094
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,800
bfd echo is that

1095
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,440
the format of the packet the payload is

1096
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,319
not defined

1097
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,119
so and that's the question

1098
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,119
to offers of this document and to

1099
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,760
the group itself so if

1100
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,520
in this document is defined that it uses

1101
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,880
their bfd control message format

1102
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,240
would that be interpreted as in all

1103
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,000
other applications of bfd echo

1104
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
they must use bfd control message format

1105
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,799
okay so that's something that we need to

1106
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:17,440
consider

1107
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,480
the impact of a

1108
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,119
decision made in this document on all

1109
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,359
other applications of bfd echo

1110
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,558
okay thank you very much

1111
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,839
so as individual i would say we need to

1112
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,440
clarify that

1113
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,680
if we do use the bfd control packet

1114
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,480
format

1115
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,640
for this it's only for the unaffiliated

1116
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,520
and all the other uses of echo existing

1117
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,839
ones don't change

1118
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,359
i don't know i'll wait

1119
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,920
also as an individual my employer is

1120
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,000
doing something very similar to this

1121
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,240
they did choose to use some portion of

1122
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,200
vfd

1123
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,960
echo packet processing because they

1124
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,760
already had code for doing so

1125
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,599
that said i'm not clear whether or not

1126
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,680
we have to specify the contents here

1127
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,079
you know one thing maybe for the authors

1128
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:20,799
to consider

1129
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,920
is do you really need to specify the

1130
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,040
contents

1131
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,000
and if you do one of your options is

1132
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,119
that you can make it

1133
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,000
uh an option rather than you know you

1134
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,559
this

1135
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,799
is the mandatory implementation this is

1136
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:36,960
after all local feature

1137
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,760
yeah uh i think we can do it we can

1138
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,359
provide the proposal

1139
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:45,680
to working group after the meeting

1140
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,799
and let's see the

1141
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,680
okay and we'll obviously take these

1142
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,359
questions to the mailing list as well

1143
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,599
thank you so

1144
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,720
next type i think

1145
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:12,400
we need more reviews and comments

1146
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,240
and we've got

1147
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,520
quite a lot of feedback and comments

1148
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,640
just now

1149
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,920
i think we will revise this draft to

1150
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,440
resolve those comments as well as

1151
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,960
some further action will

1152
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,799
be taken after the meeting

1153
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:38,000
and then we would like to ask for a

1154
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
working group last fall

1155
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,400
thank you

1156
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:49,599
thank you very much

1157
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,079
thank you so i believe that completes

1158
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,240
our agenda

1159
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,839
right on time we have a couple of few

1160
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,520
moments if somebody would like to bring

1161
00:57:59,520 --> 00:57:59,839
an

1162
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,000
other issue to the microphone otherwise

1163
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,839
we may adjourn

1164
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:11,760
give it a few seconds to see if anybody

1165
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:22,480
wants to read something

1166
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,680
there being silence let us adjourn

1167
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,200
thank you everyone thank you everyone

1168
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:37,839
see you soon
