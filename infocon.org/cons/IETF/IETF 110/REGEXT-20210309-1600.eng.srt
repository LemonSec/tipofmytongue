necessary

45
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720

just to get involved and really

115
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,319
understand the process and

116
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
if you really are in tune with a

117
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
particular document being a shepherd is

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,560
a is a good thing

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,879
so it really helps us out and helps out

120
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,239
the working group too

121
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,840
okay so next on our agenda

122
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,880
uh published works we've had a

123
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,320
banner year in 2020 um

124
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
so we have uh three rfcs that have been

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
published since the last time we met

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,880
in november data escrow the rdap query

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,919
parameters

128
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,120
uh got updated and uh the uh

129
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
partial uh well for sorting and paging

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,560
i'm sorry

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
query parameters for sorting and paging

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,320
and partial response those are

133
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
extensions to rdap

134
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
and they've both been published so

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,639
that's a good thing

136
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,600
all three of those uh and then moving

137
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,440
right along here we have our status of

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,479
existing work

139
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,360
again we've kind of had a a banner year

140
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,320
in 2020

141
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,160
we have quite a number of documents that

142
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,840
are somewhere along the way

143
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,960
in the publication cycle um and

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,880
so that's been quite a quite a year of

145
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
success for us i think this is our

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,240
our best year in terms of documents

147
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,680
moving forward

148
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,039
so the data escrow the object's mapping

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,919
document

150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
the data escrow document has already

151
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
been published the object's mapping

152
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,960
document is

153
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
imminent it's on its way we of course

154
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
have updated 7482

155
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,880
and 7483 which are the rdap query

156
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,919
and response documents they

157
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,639
are about to be upgraded to full

158
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,000
internet standards

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,120
um those are also imminent and it's

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,479
worth noting that

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
7480 and 7481 are also going to be

162
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,800
elevated

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,039
to internet standards but without errata

164
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,240
in their case so

165
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,160
in that case it's just a a process

166
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
uh step that the uh iesg goes through

167
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,720
to take those documents as is to upgrade

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,400
them and elevate them

169
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
and uh jim reed get your hand up guys

172
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,840
here um what's your best guess when

173
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
these documents will escape the rfc

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,199
editors queue

175
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,400
or is that a stupid question yeah that's

176
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
a really good question

177
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
oh barry you might want to say something

178
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
go ahead i joined it just the right time

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,039
um it is definitely not a stupid

180
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,800
question but it's a question that's very

181
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
difficult to answer

182
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,600
however um the rfc editor since the

183
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
publication of

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
cluster 238 has been turning things

185
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,840
around reasonably quickly

186
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,560
so i don't know i guess i'm guessing

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,600
probably within

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,479
uh where are we we're in this probably

189
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,000
sometime mid april is my guess

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
but it could be sooner and it could be

191
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,799
longer it's really hard to tell

192
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
okay thanks yeah thanks jim

193
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,120
and uh thanks barry for that question um

194
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
and again 7480 and 7481 which are part

195
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,880
of the rdap series of documents um

196
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,479
they're just going to elevate without

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,960
errada so that's just the status change

198
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,280
but we do do go through a process in the

199
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
ietf to reflect that so everyone knows

200
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
it

201
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,360
and then as we move up here oh um i'll

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
also just mention you'll see later

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,240
uh 7484 is a new document for us so the

204
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
last document

205
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,759
in the rdap series just has some errata

206
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,360
but we're taking that on board

207
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
give it a quick review and that would

208
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
then also move into the publication

209
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
process here

210
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
along with 7482 and 7483

211
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,560
biz so that's a good thing we also have

212
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
um the secure authorization info the

213
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,520
auth info code in epp

214
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
we have a document there which just sort

215
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,000
of extends the security options for the

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,280
auth info code

217
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,120
and of course the unhandled name spaces

218
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,160
document which applies generically to

219
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,840
epp transactions and its documentation

220
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,520
but those are also all in the

221
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
publication cycle and hopefully they'll

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,160
all

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,960
move along fairly smartly um but you

224
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
know

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
kudos to us you know thank you to the

226
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,599
working group um

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,000
it's uh just a bit of process that's

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
going on but i think i expect all of

229
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,360
these things to proceed

230
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,840
um and that's just a good reflection on

231
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,360
us we're able to move along

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,319
so much work and so many things but as

233
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,800
we see

234
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,240
we're gonna we have a number of things

235
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,160
that are also still on our agenda

236
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,520
to move along and get into so if there

237
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
are no questions about those um

238
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
we'll jump into a quick look at some

239
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
existing work and

240
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
um antoine were you going to pick up

241
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
here or did you want me to do this next

242
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,800
one too

243
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
it's okay i can do it you can do

244
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,839
whatever

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:55,360
okay well over to you i will keep uh

246
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,839
so next

247
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,080
so uh we have four documents which don't

248
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,240
have a presentation for this time

249
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
um we have regis registry maintenance um

250
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
and that basically has been in working

251
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,839
group last call already

252
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,399
but um it was taken back after working

253
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,000
with lascaux because there was two

254
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,279
narrow consensus

255
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,680
we still had quite some comments during

256
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
working with last

257
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
and actually we didn't have any um

258
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,040
people that were actively responding

259
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,160
that they would

260
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,760
that they they approved this document

261
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,880
so uh i don't know if any any of the

262
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
authors want to have a comment on this

263
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,550
on what their

264
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,600
[Music]

265
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,560
actions are going to be let's see

266
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,040
if we have so before you call on jody i

267
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
should probably jump in in fairness

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,279
um jody is one of the authors and he was

269
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,040
going to speak but i'll i'll spare him

270
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,480
and acknowledge that

271
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,880
i am actually the the document shepard

272
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,240
for this document

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
um and uh this is a work item for for

274
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,880
antoine and i

275
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
um you know i i have to review the the

276
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,760
issue that's going on here

277
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
um and then you know as part of being a

278
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,000
document shepard and

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,959
provide some comments to um antoine in

280
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,000
particular since he's going

281
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,399
to be the chair that's guiding this work

282
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,160
so this is not on the authors this is on

283
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,600
me as document shepard

284
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
not having caught up with um providing a

285
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,760
summary here that

286
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
uh we can then work with and figure out

287
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,440
what to do with i mean uh

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
so antoine's assessment they are about

289
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
not really having uh full consensus in

290
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,480
our working group

291
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
is appropriate um and we just haven't

292
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,560
figured out what we want to do about

293
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,519
that yet and

294
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
to make a proposal back to the working

295
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
group to deal with it so

296
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
that's enough and it's more precisely on

297
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,399
on me as document shepard

298
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,839
yes i i was i was more trying to

299
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,519
you know look for you know what what can

300
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
we do to get this document progressed

301
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,200
um it's it's not only uh handling the

302
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,959
comments that were made during working

303
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,880
with last call

304
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,200
but also i think we should be looking

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,640
for support

306
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,240
uh before we put something into working

307
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
group last call there must be some sort

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,279
of a sense

309
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,399
that people have read it and they're

310
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,839
going to support it during working with

311
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
last call

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,760
so jody is in the queue so jody go ahead

313
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,440
no longer hi can you guys hear me all

appreciate his feedback

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,800
uh um tobias has updated the document

we've i think we have addressed all of

323
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,000
jim's

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
concerns with the document and we feel

325
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,399
it's

326
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,920
it's probably should be going to working

327
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
group last call as we've

328
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,240

concerns that jim has with it

330
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,480
except for one the version number which

331
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,000
will update the version number one we

332
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,560
put it in

333
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,279

338
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,000
for people in the working group

339
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
the you know we need support others than

340
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
the alters during a working group last

341
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
call so

342
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
if you see that the document is is

343
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
nearing working group last call please

344
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,200
review it

345
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,760
and uh at least have a positive comment

346
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,200
during working glass call so we can

347
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
declare consensus

348
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
but if it's only you know one or two

349
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
people

350
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,839
responding to a working group last call

351
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,959
we cannot

352
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,399
call out consensus uh that everybody has

353
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,120
read the documents

354
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,839
so james go ahead

355
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,800
james do you hear me yeah now we can

356
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760

oh sorry about that yeah um yeah i just

358
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,360
want to mirror what uh

359
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,880
jody had said i wanted to thank the

360
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,399
authors for uh

361
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
working through my long list of feedback

362
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,680
and

363
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
at this point i feel like they've with

364
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,279
the latest draft have addressed

365
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,000
my feedback

366
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,920
okay thank you for that james so

367
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,760
if other people then james will read

368
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,480
this document then we could probably

369
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
move it to a second working group last

370
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,120
call

371
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
then simple registration reporting

372
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
that's also something on our list

373
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,880
james do you jim do you have something

374
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,839
to say about this or

375
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
joseph just a slow roll

376
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,480
um you know we submitted a revised

377
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,800
document with some minor edits

378
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
but we haven't uh pressed on it on the

379
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,160
mailing list so

380
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,199
um it's it's due to get some discussion

381
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,560
going again on the mailing list and

382
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,079
we'll we'll take it to there to do it

383
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,120
okay so no real progress or upgrades

384
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,160
good then the open id document now

385
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,600
that's been in our queue for

386
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
a long time um and of course we know

387
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,120
that we're waiting for some

388
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
decisions being taken there in icann to

389
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,040
see

390
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
if we need to adjust the technical

391
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
specifications here

392
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,600
um we will be talking about milestones

393
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,199
at the end of this meeting

394
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,000
and this has been on our milestones for

395
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
quite a long time and we

396
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
we are going to move it along again

397
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
um but just to give everybody a chance

398
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,920
to talk about this document scott do you

399
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,279
have any news on this document

400
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,560
so scott was here right yep and i'm here

401
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,959
antoine thank you very much

402
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
um i do have i did get one i think i

403
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,959
think was a private comment from tom

404
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:01,920
harrison with a

405
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
a very tangible suggestion to add to the

406
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,079
document and i

407
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,760
i think i'm going to get to that you

408
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,279
know when i get some free time so

409
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,040
there's at least one edit that i want to

410
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,079
make

411
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,560
um but but other than you know keeping

412
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,279
it alive

413
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,760
until we see what happens you know over

414
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,440
and i can land and whether or not that

415
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,120
has any impacts on the draft

416
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,399
i don't currently have anything else

417
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,079
queued up so we can continue to let this

418
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,399
one

419
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
simmer you know for as long as we need

420
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,839
to and as long as we're comfortable

421
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
keeping it simmering

422
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,759
yes that that is of course an issue

423
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,720
scott because yeah

424
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,440
it takes up of course some slots in the

425
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,120
working group even though you know we

426
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,680
don't

427
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,160
take any time or we don't lose any time

428
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,199
on it

429
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,440
but it's something that i think in one

430
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,320
or two years time

431
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
nobody will remember anymore what the

432
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,839
status of the document is so that's why

433
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
i'm calling it out every time

434
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
that that we meet um alex you have

435
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
other comments just just a very brief

436
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,360
comment

437
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
um i'm working on an rdub server that

438
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,199
actually uses

439
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,639
uh jbts to authenticate users it's not a

440
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
full open id connect uh

441
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,240
implementation but at least this

442
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
understands the the

443
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,759
the the authentication header

444
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,920
so that's maybe something where i

445
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,839
hopefully will have time to review that

446
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,519
that draft again and provide some

447
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,600
feedback squad

448
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,040
because it's obviously really related

449
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,160
yeah thank you much appreciated alex

450
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,720
just thank you too okay then

451
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
the next document is a document that we

452
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,240
recently adopted which is

453
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,279
a js contact um

454
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,680
this document used to be called jcart

455
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,959
depreciation

456
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,160
now during the adoption of this document

457
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,480
we

458
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,800
thought that would not be very much

459
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
appropriate it would be appropriate to

460
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,000
uh use this document to define js

461
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
contact in rdap

462
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,240
but not mandate uh depreciation of jcart

463
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,839
because it has been

464
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
implemented already and i think we need

465
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,280
to think

466
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,480
a little bit more about that but since

467
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
we recently adopted it

468
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,359
i asked mario and gavin if they had a

469
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,280
presentation on what the status is they

470
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,559
don't have a presentation

471
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,439
on this document yet but do you still

472
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,959
want to say anything about it

473
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,000
mario or gavin

474
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,760
can you hear me yep yeah

475
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,520
i don't know if gavin is participating

476
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,960
at the meeting it seems

477
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,880
that he's not participating

478
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,080
i would simply

479
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,559
saying that we are just

480
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,880
we we are just waiting for the outcome

481
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
of the

482
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,880
extended call for working group adoption

483
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,360
to

484
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,799
move the document forward i

485
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,480
i know that there are there is some

486
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,440
interests uh

487
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,000
from alex my roofer and yazda

488
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,400
to contribute to this document

489
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
so i think that if the

490
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,600
now the the document is adopted we will

491
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,320
go

492
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,399
we will move the document forward

493
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,360
with new updates for the next meeting

494
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,880
okay thank you for that mario for the

495
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
clarification

496
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,360
scots go ahead

497
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,240
i want scott holland back uh yeah i

498
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,799
think i'm

499
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
one of the people that was probably the

500
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,400
reason for why we needed to do a second

501
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,480
you know adoption call here uh and i

502
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
think we've gotten past that right but

503
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
my concern was that

504
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,200
if we deprecate j card right what that

505
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,559
implies is

506
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,640
it goes away and everyone who's already

507
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,799
implemented invested the time and effort

508
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,480
and getting it working

509
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
you know might find themselves having to

510
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,840
throw out something that's

511
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,600
you know already working and working

512
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,120
well so

513
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
if we maybe change this from deprecation

514
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,120
to

515
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,160
an alternative representation i

516
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
am less concerned you know about

517
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,600
adopting the work and

518
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,280
and taking that on yes so thank you

519
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
scott because that's exactly what we

520
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,280
were uh

521
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
we were suggesting when adopting this

522
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,960
document so the uh

523
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
the naming of the document will change

524
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
and uh it will just

525
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,559
be using js contact

526
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,600
okay that was status of existing work

527
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,840
of documents without a presentation next

528
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
slide please jim

529
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
next slide because now we will have some

530
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,240
presentation of

531
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
existing work and the first one will be

532
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,240
the reverse search documents

533
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,559
you get up the presentation gym and then

534
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,799
i leave it to mario to do the

535
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,360
presentation

536
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,039
and just say next when you want the next

537
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,559
slide and jim will uh

538
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,159
uh yeah we can hear you

539
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,799
we cannot hear jim because he's on mute

540
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,840
yeah

541
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,159
i'm waiting uh for the ready for the

542
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,559
presentation yes

543
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,400
before the screen is playing they didn't

544
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,760
depend okay

545
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,200
let's skip the first two slides that are

546
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,080
merely introductory and jump to the

547
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,639
third one

548
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
please

549
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,520
okay i started the review of research

550
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,559
document

551
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
reverse search document from working

552
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,000
group feedback

553
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,880
at last meeting i divided the comments

554
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,679
into groups

555
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,080
those regarding the technical issues and

556
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,559
it seems like we lost mario

557
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,520
can you hear me now yes

558
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,400
i repeat but it's something due to to

559
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
mitiko i

560
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
i i didn't touch anything uh

561
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,880
so um regard to the technical issues

562
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
uh alex said that we need a

563
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,960
aaa infrastructure to support reverse

564
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
search

565
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,200
and about the privacy aspects urix and

566
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,240
alex agreed

567
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,559
that the privacy construction section

568
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,240
should say something more than the

569
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,280
statement

570
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,799
followed the law and one suggested to

571
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,919
engage

572
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,080
the human rights protocol considerations

573
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
work group to review

574
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,080
that section despite that

575
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
that working group has already

576
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,240
manifested a clear opinion

577
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,760
a negative opinion about the document

578
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,799
next slide please

579
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
next try next slide please

580
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,880
okay about the technical issue

581
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,400
no this is the you jump to

582
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
you you skip a slide okay

583
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,000
about the technical issues i agree that

584
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
we are alex that

585
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,039
we do need an aia infrastructure but

586
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,280
not only for the research but for all

587
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,840
the standard searches

588
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,120
i don't see the my presentation

589
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
i keep talking my internet is

590
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,559
complaining about

591
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,000
um not being solid

592
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,080
but here comes back uh okay

593
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,080
the the the measures uh

594
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,639
to uh to address this uh

595
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,000
the solutions are uh well known and are

596
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,600
based on the assumption

597
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,240
that searches should shouldn't be opened

598
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
to everyone

599
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,159
and consequently limitation and

600
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,080
restrictions on patterns

601
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,880
and query capabilities making searches

602
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,720
more sustainable like

603
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,240
those described by the recent rfc

604
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,120
documents

605
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,200
89 77 and 89 82

606
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
should be differentiated differentiated

607
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,439
according to the user profile

608
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,120
next slide please

609
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,840
about the possible privacy threads

610
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,550
i have not received any feedback so i

611
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,639
[Music]

612
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,760
i took you from what is

613
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,960
reported in the rfc

614
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,120
6973 privacy consideration for internet

615
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,240
protocols

616
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,080
and i identified three possible threats

617
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,520
occurring in this case

618
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,640
one is disclosure that is the

619
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,480
revelation of personal information

620
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,200
the second one is secondary use the use

621
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
of collected personal information

622
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,679
without the individual individual

623
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,600
content for a purpose

624
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
different from that for which the

625
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,559
information was collected

626
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,360
and the third one is misuse the use of

627
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,679
information about

628
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,480
an individual for a part was different

629
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,200
from that

630
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,000
for which the user was requested and

631
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,559
approved

632
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,640
secondary news and misuse seem

633
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
to be similar but the first one is

634
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,559
related to the use

635
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,360
by the data provider while the second

636
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
one is related to the use by the data

637
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
consumer

638
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,000
next tries next slide please

639
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,559
two other privacy threads connected with

640
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,120
research search capability are

641
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,720
the delivery of pii as a query parameter

642
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
in a get request

643
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,600
that is not considered a best practice

644
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,320
in

645
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,159
rest api development and the ability

646
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,039
to detect facts about an individual

647
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,760
starting

648
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
from a a bi i don't know if

649
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,200
there is uh uh

650
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,600
other threats uh uh if if

651
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
you know other threads connected to this

652
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,279
particular capability please share them

653
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:11,200
next slide please

654
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,240
okay before going into much detail with

655
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,440
the analysis

656
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,000
of uh privacy threats and the related

657
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,600
mitigation measures

658
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
i would like to briefly recall that some

659
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,840
gdpr

660
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,480
gdpr principles refers to

661
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
gdpr as the most known privacy

662
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,080
protection regulation

663
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,120
and i'll hopefully demonstrate in the

664
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,159
following that

665
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
a fully gdpr compliant implementation

666
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,480
of reverse research is feasible i will

667
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,960
also refer to openid the following

668
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,240
as a protocol for supporting a

669
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
authentication authorization and

670
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,320
accounting

671
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,960
gdpr states that you must have a lawful

672
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,240
basis in order to treat personal data

673
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
in there in the rdap context it means

674
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,360
that

675
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,760
other providers must collect treat and

676
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,240
provide query capabilities and response

677
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,360
contents

678
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,520
in compliance with those lawful basis

679
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,480
or other local privacy protection those

680
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,039
imports

681
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,320
please next slide

682
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
now i will uh i go much in detail with

683
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,760
the

684
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,559
measure to mitigate the privacy friends

685
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,159
them

686
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,360
as it also stated by rfc is

687
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,000
cm 6973 the most common way to mitigate

688
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,120
the disclosure

689
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,600
is by implementing an access control

690
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
mechanism

691
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,880
this can be done by distinguishing

692
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,640
minimizing inquiry capabilities

693
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,559
and response contents on a payroll base

694
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,000
within identity management in particular

695
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,279
innovatives can be achieved through the

696
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:01,760
a

697
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,960
standard scope claim

698
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,279
other measures are known in particular i

699
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,360
would like to outline that

700
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,559
the first one like

701
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,640
that is ensuring that the endpoint of

702
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,559
the communication is the one that is

703
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,960
intended

704
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
the first one is implemented in the

705
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
current reverse search specification

706
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
since

707
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,159
the reverse session point is

708
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,080
distinguished

709
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,600
from the other searches so that it

710
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,679
it's easy for the programmer to protect

711
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,799
that and the point

712
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,000
and and additionally

713
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,279
protect implement additional protection

714
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,960
protection levels

715
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,000
can be realized depending on the

716
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,399
on the contact role i mean if the

717
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,000
contact is registered

718
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,440
attacking a contract a registrar or

719
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,080
and so on

720
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,520
please next slide please

721
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,240
protecting against the second that is

722
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,039
user is

723
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,720
usually outside the scope of ietf

724
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,760
protocols in the context of

725
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,480
registration data discovery systems they

726
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:14,880
are

727
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,279
there are registry asking the individual

728
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,240
for a generic concept for publishing

729
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,440
including for example dot id so they

730
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,039
rely on the first

731
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,320
gdpr level basis to return

732
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,520
reducted or unreduced the data

733
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,559
but but thus far that concept

734
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,039
has been about a lookup capable

735
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,480
capability like

736
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
a nuisance so

737
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
this concept is not about

738
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,600
a search capability

739
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,039
so i wondered if another provider

740
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,880
supporting reverse research

741
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,399
should request the contact for a

742
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,559
specific concept

743
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,080
my answer is no if reverse research is

744
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,000
available only to accredited

745
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,760
users and the interaction with those

746
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,480
users with these users is supported by

747
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,960
some other lawful basis

748
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,320
otherwise if the answer is yes should be

749
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,039
could be yes i think that a special

750
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,679
concept

751
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,520
should also be requested for the

752
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,399
provisioning of contact information

753
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,600
in a collection of results returned by

754
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
by standard search so if

755
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,520
if we need the special content

756
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,480
we need a special content special

757
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,000
concept for every

758
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,520
kind of search not not only for the

759
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,480
specific

760
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,240
reverse search next slide please

761
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,640
misuse can be mitigated by required the

762
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,360
request

763
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,600
that the request purpose so that an

764
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,039
implementer can reinforce a role-based

765
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,440
with a purpose-based access control

766
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,559
in my opinion that can be achieved by

767
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,919
following two different

768
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,760
approaches in the first approach the

769
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,159
registry has a deal of fairness

770
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,559
with special categories of accredited

771
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,760
users

772
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,240
like police officers and authorities

773
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,600
that are implicitly legitimated to

774
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,080
submit

775
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,000
the request under a stated purpose

776
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,760
this approach can be implemented by

777
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
using the adapt specific

778
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,440
purpose claim defined by scott

779
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,480
in the adapted

780
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,559
extension instead some other registries

781
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,039
including dot id for example requires

782
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,240
each time

783
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,880
documents assessing that the requester

784
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,000
is legitimate

785
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,360
to submit the given request no matter

786
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,159
no matter the stated purpose in this

787
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:04,960
case

788
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,320
a more fine grain access control can be

789
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,880
implemented by assigning

790
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,039
the requester with a time limited

791
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,320
credential

792
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,279
linked only to the performance of a

793
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,240
giving request

794
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,919
next slide

795
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,519
next they measure to mitigate the

796
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,559
delivery of

797
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,679
a pie in a get register are known here

798
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,159
again

799
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,880
controlling the access to reverse search

800
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
capability

801
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,120
obviously securing the transport channel

802
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,399
that is making uh provided information

803
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,480
on

804
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,480
https a better

805
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,880
solution would be to use a post request

806
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,279
but the post method is not considered in

807
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,279
adapt currently

808
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,000
any anyway if these measures were not

809
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,640
considered

810
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,640
sufficient uh similarly we couldn't omit

811
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,600
the entities

812
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,399
that entities could be searched by an

813
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,000
entity named pattern

814
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,679
like that shown in the slide

815
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,120
next slide please

816
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,360
to mitigate the risk of using the

817
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,279
reverse search in order to detect

818
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,159
facts about individuals the solution is

819
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,640
to permit the usage of this capability

820
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,600
only to those

821
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,440
users that can rely on lawful basis

822
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,840
other than content for publishing

823
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,440
for the first reported the use case the

824
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,799
role based access

825
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,240
control should be enough the

826
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,200
implementors could add an implicit feed

827
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
to a researcher including reverse

828
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,440
research

829
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,559
to let the legend the registrars

830
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,519
access only the information of their own

831
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,399
their own

832
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,360
objects their own domains and their own

833
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,159
contacts

834
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,199
and not the domain and concepts managed

835
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,760
by other registrars

836
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,560
for the other two use cases a

837
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,599
purpose-based

838
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,839
or an attribute-based access control

839
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,440
should be implemented according the

840
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,399
trust

841
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,480
according to the trust model between the

842
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,679
registry

843
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
and the special categories of accredited

844
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
users

845
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,480
anyway i i would like to outline that uh

846
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,040
the reverse church is not the only mean

847
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,480
by which effects

848
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,839
can be detected in adapt

849
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,960
we we can do the same

850
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,599
by using the the standard searches

851
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,960
next slide please

852
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,800
my conclusions about the privacy threats

853
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,720
and mitigation are reported in this

854
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,400
slide

855
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,119
it is undoubtful that every rdap

856
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,200
implementation is conditioned by

857
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,880
the privacy protection regulation

858
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,240
an adapter provider must comply with

859
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,359
gdpr or more stringent

860
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,520
i don't know other regulation

861
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
are important in this presentation some

862
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,440
point possible privacy threats

863
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,079
and mitigation measures don't know how

864
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,520
much the list is uh

865
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,560
exhaustive if you think that other

866
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,520
privacy threads

867
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,720
should be considered please share them

868
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,040
but my opinion is that all of them are

869
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,760
connected

870
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,920
not only with the implementation of the

871
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
reverse search but with the adapt

872
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,160
searches in general

873
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,560
as a consequence other providers must

874
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,200
implement

875
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,440
access control measures that are

876
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,640
increasingly

877
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,520
stringent depending on the user's

878
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,040
categories

879
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,520
and the required protection levers

880
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,320
as a buzz as a basic policy i would

881
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,680
recommend our

882
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,839
providers to not to not allow

883
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,640
the reverse search on the contact on the

884
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
contact information

885
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,880
whose owners have given their own

886
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
concept for publishing so

887
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
uh i would recommend it to not use

888
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,560
the concept for publishing lawful basis

889
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,359
as

890
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,920
to in order to support a reverse

891
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,200
search implementation open to

892
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,759
everyone

893
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,040
next slide please

894
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,240
this is the last slide this is about

895
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,440
human right privacy consideration

896
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,839
working group opinion and engagement in

897
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,800
reviewing this document

898
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,320
unlike the the

899
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,920
human rights protocol human rights

900
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,680
privacy conservation working group

901
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,320
there are some requirements from legal

902
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,640
stakeholders to open reverse research to

903
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,280
accredit

904
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,000
users for abuse and cyber crime

905
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,520
investigation

906
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,560
therefore if we agree that this document

907
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,119
needs

908
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,400
an external review i would simply

909
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,960
suggest

910
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,440
to bring it to the attention of other

911
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
forums dealing with

912
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,079
all issues of relevance to

913
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,960
tld registry and having a legal

914
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,839
foundation or legal implications

915
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,640
uh next slide

916
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,480
that's all from my side i would like to

917
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,320
invite everyone to give feedback

918
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,119
so i can finally review the privacy

919
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,480
considerations

920
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,240
privacy considerations section

921
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,319
and move the document forward

922
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,079
that's all so thank you mario for that

923
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,320

924
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,920
good assessment of all the

925
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,640
privacy issues that may be in this

926
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,520
document

927
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,480
is there before i make my comments is

928

931
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,480
yeah thanks antoine interesting

932
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,160
presentation manfredo

933
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,920
could you please scroll up to the last

934
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,160
slide and consent a lot about the last

935
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,599
bullet point

936
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,000
who are talking for getting people from

937
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
a legal background

938
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,240
to do a review of the document what

939
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,680
would be the purpose of that

940
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,800
is it to provide legal advice and i

941
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,880
don't think the itf's the position to do

942
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,760
that

943
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,359
i don't think we want the position of

944
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,760
having to give what's potential legal

945
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,640
advice that has

946
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,680
all sorts of legal implications to it

947
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,400
if it's just a sanity check to say how

948
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,680
we considered all the main

949
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,040
considerations

950
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,359
then fine but i think it'd be very

951
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,800
problematical to be on

952
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,119
go beyond that point both from a

953
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,480
practical point of view

954
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,240
and also because of these legalistic

955
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,520
concerns

956
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,880
and we all have to bear in mind of

957
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
course that every registry is operating

958
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,680
in a different legislative regime

959
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,119
and what's legal in one is not

960
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,599
necessarily legal in another

961
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,000
so maybe all we need to put here is this

962
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,520
is what we think are

963
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,640
the privacy concerns and issues but if

964
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,680
you want definitive

965
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,599
information about these things please

966
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:30,960
consult your local

967
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,680
law enforcement and others consult your

968
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,480
own lawyers

969
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
i don't think going beyond that is a

970
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,040
sensible thing to do in an itf document

971
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,520
thank you

972
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,880
i don't know if you want to respond to

973
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,000
that mario

974
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,920
i i am not in favor of a

975
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,440
contribution externa to this working

976
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,839
group

977
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,880
so coming from

978
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,400
outside this working group

979
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,160
i i think that

980
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,160
no member of this working group

981
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,800
have a technical at the legal background

982
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,599
so we can

983
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,920
discuss about technical problems and not

984
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,440
legal problems

985
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,960
i'm simply i simply

986
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,079
saying that that

987
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,160
there are requirements come

988
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,560
coming from legal forums about

989
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,599
putting together privacy and

990
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,800
accountability so

991
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,839
i'm trying to uh

992
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,200
this document was bought

993
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,040
simply to to give an answer to

994
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,240
the requirements for

995
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,400
registrars wishing to

996
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,440
searching their own domains and contacts

997
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,880
so they have they were

998
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,400
perfectly supported by the gdpr lawful

999
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,839
basis

1000
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,960
the contract of basis to to

1001
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,800
to access this capability and

1002
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,920
other providers we are perfectly

1003
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,680
uh supported by by

1004
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,480
this uh by this lawful basis in

1005
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,280
provisioning this capability

1006
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,160
but a lot of discussion uh

1007
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,520
has been has been made so far

1008
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,560
about the privacy concerns i

1009
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,680
i i repeat since

1010
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,880
the the the very

1011
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,480
beginning the very first beginning that

1012
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,599
i don't i i my opinions that this kind

1013
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,400
of

1014
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,240
search like the other searches cannot be

1015
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,520
opened to everyone

1016
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,640
but only to accredited users

1017
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,440
so and the creative users who are

1018
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,839
legitimated to

1019
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,960
access this capability like as the as

1020
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,119
well the other searches so

1021
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,440
uh i think that we

1022
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,680
in my opinion we it seems that outside

1023
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,359
we are requesting to

1024
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,440
put together the privacy uh

1025
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,839
the privacy concern with the other

1026
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,839
concerns about

1027
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,839
cyber crime investigation and abuse

1028
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,400
investigation this is my

1029
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,680
this is my opinion this my this is

1030
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,960
this is my basic uh

1031
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,240
principle to move forward this document

1032
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,440
so okay

1033
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,359
the decent clarification you know for

1034
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,040
those who haven't followed this document

1035
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,520
for

1036
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,560
some time technically

1037
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,079
i think the document is very far

1038
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,359
very far progressing and we are only

1039
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,000
looking at

1040
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,280
what should be in the privacy

1041
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,400
consideration section

1042
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,240
so that's why there is this focus on

1043
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,720
this okay next in cue

1044
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,000
mark go ahead

1045
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,400
one two one two do you hear me yes um

1046
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,319
well um i know that uh gdpr is the uh

1047
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,960
the the current example of you know

1048
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
privacy regulations but

1049
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,880
um i understand also that you know many

1050
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,800
governments are actually looking at it

1051
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,240
and obviously

1052
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,640
they will end up doing a slightly

1053
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,480
different version of gdpr

1054
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,560
just because you know you know they like

1055
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,839
to do it their own way

1056
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,079
um and to a point where where

1057
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,960
maybe some of the uh comments here may

1058
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,520
be

1059
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,000
you know not relevant anymore in the

1060
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,040
sense that

1061
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,160
you know for some country maybe uh i'll

1062
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,079
throw it something you know maybe

1063
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,480
general access is just fine but you know

1064
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,760
don't don't

1065
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
don't show anything or you know oh

1066
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,440
there's all kinds of variations that

1067
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,400
could enter

1068
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,480
and that could be based on regulation

1069
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,400
and or policies

1070
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,640
so i'm i you know maybe we should be

1071
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,160
almost and i'm concerned that it's going

1072
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,200
to be a rattle so

1073
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,160
you know my suggestion would be to

1074
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,040
minimize

1075
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,000
the the amount of of words and stuff

1076
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,520
related to gdpr

1077
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,079
or privacy and just say you know you

1078
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,119
know look at

1079
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,480
the you know regulation and or policy

1080
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,599
because we will my take is we will

1081
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,640
ever never end that discussion

1082
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,480
because we'll get another uh you know

1083
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,520
a possible uh you know twist on this and

1084
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,240
we'll have to discuss again so i'm kind

1085
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,160
of concerned that we're

1086
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,200
going too deep in it yeah

1087
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,000
i agree with you mark the only thing

1088
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,440
where this document of course is

1089
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,119
different is because this document is

1090
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,599
the first time where we aggregate data

1091
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,359
and um that's why there was quite some

1092
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,800
feedback from the hrpr group that

1093
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,590
we should have an extensive um

1094
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,280
[Music]

1095
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,520
privacy section okay next

1096
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,520
go ahead mrs

1097
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,319
uh yes so uh as being one of the ones

1098
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,280
the ones we have

1099
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,960
always spoken for having a privacy

1100
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,119
section on this i would say

1101
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,720
first i want to say that i'm really

1102
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,119
impressed by the work mario has put into

1103
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:47,839
this

1104
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,920
i think he has done a really good job in

1105
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,839
going through all the threats

1106
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,119
and uh i agree that we maybe shouldn't

1107
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,800
take up gdpr

1108
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,880
but all the other privacy threat that

1109
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,160
mario has taken up

1110
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,079
i think should be documented in the

1111
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,680
privacy section

1112
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,160
and then that's totally okay then every

1113
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,079
implementer can look at their local

1114
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,960
laws see what the privacy implications

1115
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,960
is and where they

1116
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,800
agree with the law or disagree with the

1117
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,359
law and implement it according to it

1118
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,839
and i think that the whole idea of the

1119
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,000
privacy section is to just point out

1120
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,560
this

1121
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,240
here are the pain points look at those

1122
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,079
and i think mario did an excellent job

1123
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,760
of putting these out today

1124
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,800
so thank you mario

1125
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,640
now we only need somebody to write text

1126
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,160
right

1127
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,599
thank you wolvie barry

1128
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,040
rad you're up next um i want to

1129
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,760
highlight

1130
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,599
some of the things that jim reid said

1131
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:46,960
that

1132
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,480
it's it's fine to put privacy

1133
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,200
considerations and we should do that

1134
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:57,359
we we take anybody's input regardless of

1135
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,200
what their background is or where they

1136
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,240
come from so

1137
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,720
if someone with some legal background

1138
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,400
makes comments we consider those

1139
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,160
comments just as we would from anybody

1140
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,880
else

1141
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,440
but actively soliciting legal review of

1142
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,160
a document

1143
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,880
is really on the edge for the ietf and

1144
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,240
we certainly don't want

1145
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,440
any sense in the record that we made an

1146
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,440
overt effort to get a legal review of a

1147
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,119
document because that could come out

1148
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,119
come back to bite us later if there are

1149
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,640
any challenges

1150
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,520
so um we need to look at what

1151
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:33,760
if we need privacy issues

1152
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,240
commented on suggested commented

1153
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:36,880
reviewed

1154
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,640
that's fine and we should proceed with

1155
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,880
that let's try to keep the idea of legal

1156
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,760
review out of this

1157
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,839
thank you next jim

1158
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,960
thanks so

1159
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,800
um so speaking as an individual uh

1160
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,880
not not co-chair um i know that

1161
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,520
uh this document stalled because you

1162
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,440
know in this group we couldn't find

1163
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,400
consensus

1164
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,640
on what should go in the privacy

1165
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
consideration section

1166
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,880
there is some text that's there and i

1167
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,720
appreciate that you know mario kind of

1168
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,079
walked through

1169
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
you know a lot of the motivation um and

1170
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,800
issues that were considered

1171
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,760
in drafting the text that's there so you

1172
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,520
know certainly the question to date in

1173
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,480
this working group

1174
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,880
is are we passed the privacy

1175
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,440
considerations section in the document

1176
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,559
um and and you know all of that's there

1177
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,839
however uh what i wanted to raise is is

1178
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,599
focusing more on the technical side of

1179
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,960
this document

1180
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,880
um i've been reflecting on this document

1181
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,000
and looking at it

1182
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,599
and of course i've been involved in a

1183
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,280
lot of rdap discussions

1184
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,480
on on on the policy side which i know is

1185
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,319
not normally something the ietf really

1186
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,359
thinks about

1187
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,400
but as a result of that um i'm i'm

1188
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,240
evolving a different kind of technical

1189
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,920
perspective about this document and

1190
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,359
thinking that there's some work that we

1191
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,160
ought to

1192
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,880
consider that i that i'd like to propose

1193
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,559
um you know

1194
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,559
i i'm a little concerned about the fact

1195
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,079
that this document focuses on

1196
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,920
directionality so it's called reverse

1197
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,720
search

1198
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,359
and i'm deciding that at least for me

1199
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:26,800
i'm not fond of that

1200
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,880
and and i'd like to visit that in in

1201
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,960
this working group and and uh

1202
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,520
you know on on the mailing list um the

1203
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,640
rdap documents

1204
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,800
do have a certain searching

1205
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,079
specification

1206
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:40,880
i'd rather see this document expand

1207
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,760
searching

1208
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,000
and talk about other ways to do

1209
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,839
additional kinds of searching

1210
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,880
and not focus on directionality um

1211
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,119
and then there's also some emphasis on

1212
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,200
you know being able to search because

1213
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,599
of uh particular elements like name and

1214
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,800
email address

1215
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,800
and and i'm thinking you really ought to

1216
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,559
abstract back and talk about

1217
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:03,599
elements um and and think about

1218
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,760
uh you know and thus it would be more

1219
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,880
applicable

1220
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,839
in in uh to be more extensible rather

1221
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,599
than focusing on just a couple of things

1222
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,960
and how to do those

1223
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,280
it should have an extensible mechanism

1224
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,760
for what you can specify what you get

1225
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,960
um anyway i my

1226
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,680
my guess in summary i'm beginning to

1227
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,839
develop in my own mind some technical

1228
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,400
questions

1229
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,839
about how to approach what this document

1230
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,440
does

1231
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,720
and i'm thinking i'm going to raise

1232
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,800
those on the mailing list and that's

1233
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,920
separate from

1234
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,559
the fact that we're trying to deal with

1235
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,480
what the privacy considerations ought to

1236
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,040
be

1237
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,720
so i don't want to i don't want to close

1238
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,800
that question if that's been open

1239
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,559
but i'm kind of opening a new one that

1240
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:47,920
i'm going to raise on the mailing list

1241
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,200
to move this forward

1242
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,240
so that's it thanks

1243
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,759
okay thank you jim next up richard

1244
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,720
thank you very much can hear me okay yep

1245
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,079
my graph is moving thank you

1246
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,960
very much um uh very briefly uh just

1247
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,960
wanted to

1248
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,760
offer a comment on the on one of the

1249
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,720
slides here

1250
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,000
these slides aren't numbered a little

1251
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,680
bit earlier there was a comment about

1252
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,920
allowing registrars to search only their

1253
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,559
own

1254
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,559
contacts um it occurs to me that one

1255
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,040
this is presupposing a couple of things

1256
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,599
one

1257
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,559
about a model of reverse search or

1258
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,440
search

1259
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,640
to sort of get to jim galvin's point

1260
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,760
that presupposes search at a registry

1261
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,359
and a in a registry registrar model

1262
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,480
and you know perhaps we

1263
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,920
one registrars actually would have

1264
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,880
their own data already and probably

1265
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,319
wouldn't need to be

1266
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,520
searching the registry uh so

1267
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,480
so it might be a possibility to simplify

1268
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,800
the the document in that regard and not

1269
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,160
you know concern themselves because i'm

1270
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,640
not really sure why the registrars who

1271
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,000
need to be searching the registry

1272
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,079
since there since the registrar is

1273
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:07,359
really authoritative

1274
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,160
for the contact data and the registry

1275
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
only has a copy of data

1276
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,079
which may or may not be accurate it

1277
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,400
might be privacy proxied

1278
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,920
or something like that so maybe that's

1279
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,839
an opportunity to simplify it

1280
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,319
um and then you know just it was

1281
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:23,440
interesting to see

1282
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,640
jim galvin bring that comment up about

1283
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,000
uh some of the differences in search

1284
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,680
there and that's i'll be looking forward

1285
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,839
to seeing that uh be explored on the

1286
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:34,480
list

1287
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,079
um i hadn't thought about that when i

1288
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,000
got into queue obviously since jim had

1289
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,040
made it but i just

1290
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,640
thought i'd tack that on at the end

1291
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,640
thank you very much

1292
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,880
yeah thank you richard i think the

1293
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,480
difference there is between thin

1294
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,160
and thick registries where you want to

1295
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,520
do reverse search

1296
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,680
but i'll let mario speak later when

1297
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,680
because i see it still in the queue

1298
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,520
but jim is waiting also for quite some

1299
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,079
time so jim please go ahead

1300
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,160
thanks antoine i hope this is the right

1301
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,000
gem this time

1302
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,079
um i just want to go back to this uh

1303
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,760
issue about the privacy consideration

1304
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,160
stuff

1305
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,640
um mario's done a great job of

1306
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,240
enumerating many of these privacy

1307
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,480
concerns and mitigation techniques

1308
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,319
and i was not trying to disparage that

1309
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,920
work in any way

1310
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,000
but i think to make some progress with

1311
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,880
this document on that particular area

1312
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,280
i think we need to draw a line under it

1313
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,800
and i think the formal awards we

1314
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,319
probably want to use here is something

1315
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,200
that says

1316
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,880
this is the collective understanding of

1317
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,559
the working groups

1318
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,760
knowledge of this subject area at this

1319
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,559
time

1320
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,240
there may be other issues there might

1321
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,119
not if you want to know more about that

1322
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,280
consult your local lawyers i think

1323
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,040
that's all we can really do here

1324
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,440
and if we did that we could close off

1325
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,280
that section of the document

1326
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,040
and we'll avoid some of the rap hauling

1327
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,400
i think it was rick

1328
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,559
mentioned earlier on as a potential

1329
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:53,680
possibility

1330
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,760
if we try to keep exploring this and

1331
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,800
we've got the potential

1332
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,040
to dig and keep on digging and maybe

1333
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,960
never ever get to a conclusion

1334
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,640
so i think the wise thing to do is make

1335
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,800
a decision hopefully soon

1336
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,280
this is as far as we can go and then try

1337
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,880
to progress the rest of the document

1338
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,240
because there's other stuff that i think

1339
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,400
is perhaps more need of attention

1340
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,599
that's just been talked about thank you

1341
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,599
thank you jim and you know if you

1342
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,880
support this um

1343
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,119
you know there should be consensus on

1344
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,040
the on the mailing list and that's what

1345
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,040
we've done so far and so far there was

1346
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,480
no consensus on the mainly this on the

1347
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,599
privacy consideration

1348
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,520
section so if there's consensus on the

1349
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,800
mailing list then we can move this

1350
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,319
document forward

1351
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,040
and mario i'll leave you to respond to

1352
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,480
all the comments

1353
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,599
yes i am very happy to hear that

1354
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,200
we can move the document to face

1355
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,760
the technical topics technical issues

1356
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,119
and a brief comment about what

1357
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:56,319
said richard

1358
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,480
[Music]

1359
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,520
we have in total we have a lot of

1360
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,119
little registrars small registrars

1361
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,480
they simply rely on the

1362
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,000
information stored by the registry

1363
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,559
maintained by the registry so that they

1364
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,760
they don't have enough

1365
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,200
that they don't spend the effort in uh

1366
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,480
in implementing uh and

1367
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,200
and maintaining their own in information

1368
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,880
about contents this

1369
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,440
and the other and it's here for example

1370
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,040
they simply write

1371
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,240
rely on the fact that that

1372
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,319
information is maintained by the

1373
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,839
registry so we are

1374
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,720
frequently requested for

1375
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,720
for for example the number of contacts

1376
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,880
technical contacts

1377
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,400
associated to this domain or

1378
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,040
what are the numbers sorry what are they

1379
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,520
the

1380
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,720
the domains uh associated

1381
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,760
uh to this technical content what

1382
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,960
what are the domains associated to these

1383
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,079
registers because

1384
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,079
they don't have this information but

1385
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:21,839
in our in our regulation

1386
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,000
in dota 2 regulation you you cannot

1387
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,280
as a registrar you cannot access the

1388
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,200
information of another registrar

1389
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,040
so this is why

1390
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,079
i imagine that

1391
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,599
that registrars cannot

1392
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,960
manage the information of the other

1393
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,920
register and

1394
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,400
it makes sense for us that a

1395
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,480
registrar could

1396
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,319
search could um

1397
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:02,720
execute a a reverse search on their own

1398
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,240
on on his own domains or contacts

1399
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,359
because

1400
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:10,640
they don't have this information

1401
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,400
i don't know if i explained the concept

1402
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,720
well

1403
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,839
okay thank you mario then

1404
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:27,200
scots final comments

1405
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,920
juan yes scott holland back and um while

1406
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,440
we were talking here i just i had a

1407
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,720
revelation

1408
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,760
um mario you had asserted in your deck

1409
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,319
that this thing that we are calling

1410
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,880
reverse search has some of the same

1411
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,400
um concerns properties you know whatever

1412
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,760
we want to call it as

1413
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
the search mechanism that's currently

1414
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,559
described in

1415
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:52,480
7482 and i i think

1416
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,079
i can think of one very tangible

1417
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,680
difference and that's what's in 7482 is

1418
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,640
about

1419
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,880
searching using pattern matching

1420
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,160
techniques

1421
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,880
right but what we are calling this thing

1422
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,400
called reverse search is more about

1423
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,839
finding relationships um

1424
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,760
and and i can see them having very

1425
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,240
different privacy considerations

1426
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,640
um if you're if you're allowing search

1427
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,040
you know to find relationships

1428
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,920
you're potentially going to find things

1429
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,599
that exist in the database that aren't

1430
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,640
necessarily meant to be

1431
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,520
exposed um you know whereas the stuff

1432
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,160
that we've got

1433
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,720
in 7482 is more about as i said you're

1434
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,280
just doing very simple pattern matching

1435
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,720
anyway i wanted to throw that out there

1436
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,079
because i think if we start talking

1437
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,680
about you know how we look at search in

1438
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,280
general that distinction may be

1439
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,760
important

1440
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,200
just look mario one last comment because

1441
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,839
we are yeah

1442
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,559
yes yes i was

1443
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,280
would like simply answer scott

1444
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,319
when i talk about

1445
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,480
the that other other

1446
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,920
searches uh then research

1447
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,599
are able to to detect facts about the

1448
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,359
individual

1449
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,359
i would like to to

1450
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,559
to to give you this example

1451
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,680
uh i use a lookup domain to

1452
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,640
get the information about the domain for

1453
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,400
example i know

1454
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,880
i get the name server and rely on the

1455
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,240
fact that

1456
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,359
for example if normally

1457
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:41,200
if a known registrant owner

1458
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,079
more as more than one domains

1459
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,359
all these domains are associated with

1460
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:49,920
the same

1461
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,079
and server so i can use the the search

1462
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,119
domain i can search domains by net

1463
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,160
survey name

1464
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,359
to collect all the domains uh

1465
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,400
related to the distant server and again

1466
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,839
and i can uh check

1467
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,040
uh what are the domains uh

1468
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,799
owned by the the same the same owner

1469
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:19,200
so uh in my opinion the the

1470
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,240
the the the means through which in order

1471
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,559
that

1472
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,839
we can detect parts are various

1473
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:29,280
but i know that there are search

1474
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,839
patterns

1475
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,520
but anyway

1476
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,720
in the example of entities for example

1477
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,440
in in

1478
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,520
the example of the searching entities

1479
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,440
by by the name the name that would be

1480
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,640
a plain name not a search pattern

1481
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,599
including

1482
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,760
a white card so in this case you are

1483
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,799
delivering a a get request

1484
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,000
through the network with the with the

1485
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,680
with a plain name that

1486
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,319
presumably will be stored in some proxy

1487
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:09,440
but

1488
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,359
this is the the protocol

1489
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,280
so the best practice suggests to

1490
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,040
to provide personal information

1491
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,839
through a post meet on the

1492
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,359
but this is the process also

1493
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,799
for for this reason i i wonder why the

1494
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,040
best search is so particular

1495
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,319
so is so special and it doesn't seem to

1496
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:40,880
me

1497
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,559
so special compared to the other

1498
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:45,280
searches

1499
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,440
i i think that is

1500
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,799
it is different in the sense that we we

1501
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:58,640
we we we came from a a world where

1502
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,920
where uh there was the

1503
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,960
wiis and whose response was

1504
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,000
a look up the lookup

1505
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,680
response now we have the

1506
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,200
lookup responses look up searches

1507
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,480
and responses to look up searches and

1508
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,640
look up the queries and also search

1509
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,079
queries so

1510
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,440
we we can provide a collection

1511
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,720
of uh objects not only one object

1512
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,480
so in this

1513
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,640
in this sense it seems to me that

1514
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,039
reverse search is not so particular

1515
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,440
is uh similar to the other searches

1516
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:46,559
okay thank you mario then we will move

1517
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:48,480
on to our next

1518
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,160
presentation and let's get the

1519
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,200
privacy section discussed on the mailing

1520
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,319
list

1521
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,359
uh next presentation will be mark

1522
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:00,480
planche

1523
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,240
about 74 84 bits mark go ahead

1524
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,280
yes do you hear me yes

1525
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,920
excellent thank you okay so this is

1526
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,400
about

1527
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,520
uh rfc 7484 uh

1528
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,839
next version next slide please

1529
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,880
so to recall this document is

1530
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,440
to find the authoritative rdap server

1531
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,160
for the object you're looking for either

1532
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,680
domain ip addresses as numbers

1533
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,039
the objective for this draft

1534
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,039
is to together with the other bayes rfc

1535
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,440
rdap rcs is to move up to the standard

1536
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,640
level

1537
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,000
so next slides will present the ureta

1538
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,680
from the the rfc

1539
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,839
some changes shepard comments and next

1540
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,960
steps next slide

1541
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,160
so for serrata the

1542
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:00,079
person who reported saying that

1543
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:04,400
you know there's a text about

1544
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,240
what happens if you don't

1545
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,160
get any response for the object you're

1546
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,440
looking for

1547
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,240
in dns you can query the dns and you

1548
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:14,960
know do

1549
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,960
various stuff um and the

1550
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,480
the person says either change they

1551
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,319
you know change the the text or

1552
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:31,680
remove the paragraph next slide

1553
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,200
so the current draft actually added

1554
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,960
you know change a bit the detects but

1555
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,920
um i'm proposing instead that we just

1556
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,960
delete this by

1557
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,599
this whole paragraph i think that is

1558
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,359
remaining to

1559
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,319
the the you know discussion we had a

1560
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,280
long time ago

1561
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,559
about uh you know if this is this

1562
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,599
you know do we need to cash uh stuff

1563
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,640
and you know all that i think that's

1564
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,680
roughly relevant based on experience and

1565
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,680
i can claim to have some experience in

1566
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,440
this uh having

1567
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,440
written a few of the adapt clients and

1568
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,280
servers

1569
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,440
i think we should just delete that it's

1570
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,559
you know it's up to implementation to do

1571
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,640
you know all kind of stuff they want but

1572
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,480
you know from the purpose of

1573
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,000
the document which is essentially saying

1574
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,880
here here's a way you can find the

1575
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:27,839
server the

1576
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,640
authoritative server of the for the

1577
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,079
object you're looking for

1578
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,319
all everything else is to me out of

1579
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,440
scope so

1580
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:38,000
my suggestion is we delete this

1581
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,640
paragraph

1582
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,799
i would suggest that i go through all

1583
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,000
the slides and

1584
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,799
i'll take the questions at the end if

1585
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:47,839
you

1586
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:51,839
don't mind next slide

1587
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,119
there was an errata this there was a

1588
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,960
slash missing in the example

1589
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,079
so uh needs to be done agreed

1590
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:03,119
it's up already in the draft next slide

1591
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:07,440
so those are the two erratas for

1592
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,480
that were provided

1593
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,920
to the rc editor next i'll go through

1594
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,039
some changes um there was a suggestion

1595
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,079
from gavin brown

1596
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:20,319
to say essentially all our adapt

1597
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,920
endpoints referred

1598
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,280
by the urls in the area must return

1599
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,520
identical responses for the same airdac

1600
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,000
query

1601
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:33,760
and next slide so that's in the current

1602
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,000
uh

1603
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,680
draft and then also george michaelson

1604
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,240
said

1605
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,520
i went further down in saying

1606
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,359
uh yeah it should we should uh

1607
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,400
ref all the endpoints referenced by the

1608
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,680
urls should

1609
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,079
in the area should must return an

1610
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,160
identical response

1611
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:00,079
but notices may have uh you know

1612
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,880
things different because they may say

1613
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,880
things here and there

1614
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,400
um i maybe i'm

1615
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,680
in the uh you know make it

1616
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,640
short you know mood but i would

1617
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,839
essentially

1618
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,599
uh also just not essentially be silent

1619
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:20,240
on this

1620
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,680
uh uh you know

1621
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,960
i'm not sure we're actually doing

1622
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,160
something useful here in you know even

1623
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:30,559
saying

1624
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:33,680
that the two are that uh

1625
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,839
uh all the servers who responds the same

1626
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:38,240
thing and i think the

1627
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,319
the the comment from george actually

1628
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,839
just show it where

1629
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:44,480
it may make sense that other you know

1630
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,680
different servers may

1631
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,880
answer different you know just

1632
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,160
some variations of the same thing

1633
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:57,839
while not i guess

1634
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,200
disabling the the overall idea of the

1635
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,160
of the document or the bootstrap thing

1636
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:04,559
so

1637
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,119
i'm suggesting also that we should be

1638
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,799
silent about all this

1639
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:12,640
all together next slide

1640
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,920
some refs have been updated tls 1.3

1641
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,560
next slide

1642
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:23,600
comments on the mailing-ness i think

1643
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,479
that was from

1644
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,120
patrick also there was a comment about

1645
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,158
uh

1646
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:31,359
is do we have some uh

1647
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,719
some data about ayana having

1648
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,520
you know any issues on on serving those

1649
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,719
files

1650
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,640
and and asking for statistics i didn't

1651
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,479
get any statistics but

1652
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,759
response from ayanna kim david says

1653
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:49,279
there's no issue

1654
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,920
and you know frankly the size of those

1655
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,198
files are

1656
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,719
similar to when you open a website

1657
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,960
currently and you download a you know

1658
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,520
javascript framework

1659
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,719
file so i'm not sure that's

1660
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:07,198
you know really a problem and as soon as

1661
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:08,238
you get a cdn

1662
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,279
up then it's not an issue um

1663
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,399
the sentence has been changed slightly

1664
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:16,399
to say that uh

1665
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,560
no issues has been reported regarding

1666
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,120
the load of the service

1667
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,319
so change to sr

1668
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,238
there was a comment that we should

1669
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,279
change back to srv records i

1670
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,520
am not sure we want to reopen the whole

1671
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,158
discussion again we add in words

1672
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,600
uh pros and cons and each approaches

1673
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,479
so i'm kind of rejecting that comment

1674
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,600
unless you want to

1675
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,439
you know the group want to reopen the

1676
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:44,880
whole discussion

1677
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,920
um there was other comments about

1678
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,080
restricting to https only

1679
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:53,679
url in the services area instead of uh

1680
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,880
you know having http also given that

1681
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,679
uh some policies for some uh you know

1682
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,280
environments

1683
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,280
uh are restricting to https only and

1684
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,640
then the itf is https

1685
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,679
i'm kind of you know

1686
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:15,360
in between there it

1687
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,920
to me it's a bit out you know it's a bit

1688
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,800
policy

1689
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,520
related in the sense that you know maybe

1690
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:21,840
uh

1691
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,560
somewhere you know serving something

1692
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,080
maybe on http

1693
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,600
for some reason uh but um i'm open to

1694
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,640
anything

1695
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,800
um and i'm not sure we have a conclusion

1696
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,199
in the mailing list about this topic

1697
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,000
uh next slide

1698
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:41,520
uh from so this is kind of a that i got

1699
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,800
the review from the doc

1700
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,520
uh shepherd there's a lot of things

1701
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,239
there

1702
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,800
i put it there mostly for you know

1703
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,760
making sure that

1704
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,719
you know i'm transparent and i'm saying

1705
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:54,000
everything

1706
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,760
um so i'm kind of okay with most of the

1707
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,199
comments he made

1708
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:02,640
you know in the first slide here uh only

1709
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,360
thing that i will talk later is about uh

1710
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,679
implementation status so

1711
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,880
all so there there were a few comments i

1712
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,000
was not sure it was

1713
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,159
really needed but you know i'm fine with

1714
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,679
you know adding them

1715
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,920
next slide other comments from the duck

1716
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,120
shepherd

1717
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,320
um there was uh yeah there was an entry

1718
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:22,880
of the

1719
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,520
so there's a text in the draft and the

1720
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,360
rfc that says the entry of the root

1721
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,400
of the domain space is specified as

1722
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,679
essentially an empty string

1723
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:36,640
the dark shepherd looked at the current

1724
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,400
bootstrap file and there is no such

1725
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,360
entry

1726
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,080
and he is claiming he's asking if the

1727
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,360
sentence is

1728
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,040
is not needed i disagree this entry is

1729
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,400
needed as soon as

1730
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,600
ayanna you know put his

1731
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,719
inf server up and serving kind of the

1732
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,159
root of the main space that

1733
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,280
that sentence is appropriate and needed

1734
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,040
so i disagree with that one um

1735
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,440
and there was some discussion some

1736
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,040
comments about using

1737
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,400
ipv4 and ipv6 and as

1738
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,000
a private reserve for documentation i'm

1739
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,840
using some of those

1740
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,880
i was aware of all those but i'll try to

1741
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,679
you know change the example so i'm only

1742
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:23,040
using those so

1743
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,880
uh we'll we'll hopefully that will work

1744
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,840
and there's a catch of uh of uh you know

1745
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,080
a

1746
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,400
little uh inconsistency in the example

1747
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,520
so we'll do that

1748
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,800
too next slide

1749
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,360
um so again uh es ipv6 address for

1750
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,199
documentation

1751
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,080
uh there's a common about you know an

1752
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:48,640
extra

1753
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,440
zero you know i you know i was trying to

1754
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:52,320
make clear but

1755
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,120
you know i can remove as number reserved

1756
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,880
for documentation also next slide

1757
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,159
and uh and again

1758
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,839
about uh

1759
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,840
yeah the same paragraph about you know

1760
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,840
in terms of a domain object you could do

1761
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,920
dns queries and the guy is saying

1762
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,199
the uh doc shepard says maybe we should

1763
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,400
you know remove that sentence i'm

1764
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,199
suggesting we

1765
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:23,600
remove the whole paragraph therefore

1766
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,840
this guy

1767
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,280
you know gun and the final one is i

1768
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,280
think from his comments is about a

1769
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,080
reference to

1770
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,440
a draft which and i'm not aware that

1771
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,199
this document has been published as an

1772
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,400
rfc

1773
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,520
and but it i think still appropriate to

1774
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,560
refer to that work so i would leave it

1775
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:44,880
as

1776
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,320
is next slide

1777
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,320
so uh to my knowledge we need a

1778
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,239
kind of implementation status in

1779
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,520
documents going uh

1780
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,120
moving forward to standard um yes so

1781
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,760
here's a call to everybody who have done

1782
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,280
a net a quote quote-unquote

1783
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,560
nation that uh uh you know it's not

1784
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,520
really a full

1785
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,920
protocol itself but you know so if you

1786
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,159
fetch and parse uh one of the bootstrap

1787
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:13,120
files

1788
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,560
could you send me an email about

1789
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,040
about that and so i can collect it and

1790
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,159
create a

1791
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,640
section with implementation status as

1792
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,400
far as i know

1793
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,360
there is the mobile app i wrote are that

1794
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,520
browser i can look up tool as one

1795
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,840
or two and ayana is obviously the

1796
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,679
publisher of the files therefore they

1797
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,520
have an implementation of that

1798
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,080
bootstrap file they do not fit or parse

1799
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,520
but they write

1800
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,640
so if you have if you are parsing that

1801
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:43,920
file fetch and parse

1802
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:47,360
or then please contact me uh

1803
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,520
you know by email so i'll kind of

1804
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:50,800
collect all those uh

1805
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,840
implementation status and i think i'm

1806
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,840
mostly done next slide

1807
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,600
so looking for comments on all the

1808
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,280
you know topics i discuss if

1809
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,320
given that if changes are agreed

1810
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,520
for all those changes and that you trust

1811
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,199
me in applying it

1812
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,080
uh and i'm receiving uh implementation

1813
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,199
information from

1814
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,679
implementers you know maybe we're ready

1815
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,800
for publication

1816
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,880
so that's the end of my presentation

1817
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,840
looking for comments

1818
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,839
one two one two anybody hear me

1819
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,239
does anybody have any questions tomorrow

1820
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,960
alexander you're up next

1821
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,840
uh very quick and simple go for it it's

1822
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,719
simple enough

1823
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,560
i don't see any changes that would

1824
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:55,760
impact any protocol details or anything

1825
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,239
um waiting for implementation reports is

1826
01:15:58,239 --> 01:15:59,679
a good idea but otherwise please go

1827
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:01,360
forward and please

1828
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,320
get the document out as fast as possible

1829
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,320
it's simple enough

1830
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,639
thanks

1831
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,239
well thank you mark and if there's

1832
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:15,280
nothing else then

1833
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,880
we'll continue this work on the mailing

1834
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,679
list and let's move this document along

1835
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,560
quite quickly then and then jim if you

1836
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,840
can go back to indeed

1837
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,440
the next sections will be new work

1838
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:33,199
and request for adoptions and we have

1839
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,520
wrong presentation in that

1840
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,080
and that's from dimitri on the use of

1841
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,800
internationalized email addresses

1842
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,000
so dimitri the floor is yours

1843
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,760
hello can you hear me yes excellent

1844
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,239
okay wonderful next slide please

1845
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,199
uh first uh let's begin with a

1846
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:59,679
short reminder about the current uh

1847
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:02,159
email address and feminization status

1848
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:06,719
it was specified in the set of rfcs

1849
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:09,280
6530-6533

1850
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,480
uh it allows non-ascii left path of

1851
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:16,320
email addresses and uh

1852
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,280
requires uh more or less explicit

1853
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,400
protocol changes

1854
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,000
uh for all the protocols that refer to

1855
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,800
the previous standard describing the

1856
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,840
email address

1857
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,679
next type please

1858
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,960
uh my intention is introduce

1859
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,320
the entrance the support of

1860
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,800
yeah in epp protocol and

1861
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,719
i think that such introducing

1862
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,719
should cover all the epp objects that

1863
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,960
support email as an attribute and the

1864
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,960
such addresses should be first class

1865
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,400
option next slide is

1866
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,480
so after the fruitful discussion

1867
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,800
on the mailing list and off list

1868
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,199
we came to the concept of a functional

1869
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,120
extension

1870
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,320
it's a new form of evp extension

1871
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,920
it doesn't define any new object or

1872
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,199
object attributes

1873
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:25,760
but slightly modifies

1874
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,600
their roles of handling them

1875
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,920
it just applies the functional

1876
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:32,960
capability

1877
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,560
to existing set of attributes

1878
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,679
and objects in uh

1879
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,239
this document we introduce functional ep

1880
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:43,360
extension for the

1881
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:46,000
email address address field please next

1882
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,400
slide

1883
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,239
here is the link to the current version

1884
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,360
of the document

1885
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,480
in short it doesn't introduce any xml

1886
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,400
schema changes

1887
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,600
because the current

1888
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,640
syntax formally allows yeah addresses

1889
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,000
oh but we

1890
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,040
apply the processing

1891
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,719
rules on the president

1892
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,159
of the extension support demonstrated

1893
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:24,719
in the legend comment from the client

1894
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,960
and greeting from server

1895
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,760
the support is indicated by a special

1896
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,480
namespace

1897
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:37,839
nay next slide please

1898
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:41,920
if the extension is negatively

1899
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,360
negotiated

1900
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:47,199
then server should accept

1901
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,880
the email addresses that

1902
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,480
have valid syntaxes according to

1903
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,000
rfc6531

1904
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,120
in all the elements

1905
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,840
with the email semantics for example in

1906
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,239
a

1907
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:08,800
contact email defined in rfc 5733

1908
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,320
in the organelle

1909
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,440
rfc85043 and

1910
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:19,839
many many other documents

1911
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,280
uh if the server should accept

1912
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,320
such addresses for all the registry

1913
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,480
zones which are operated in the current

1914
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:29,679
session

1915
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:33,120
and for all the objects the addresses

1916
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,480
should be validated

1917
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:38,560
according to the aaa validation rules

1918
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,679
their email attributes

1919
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,800
should be stored and returned

1920
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,920
as is according to the universal

1921
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,520
acceptance rules

1922
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,320
in the part of email addresses next

1923
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,880
slide please

1924
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,080
when the extension is negotiated the

1925
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:02,719
client

1926
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,239
uh should provide the ai

1927
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,560
compatible addresses for all the email

1928
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,520
properties

1929
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,800
in the current session

1930
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:15,840
the same examples

1931
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,040
at the end the maple clan should apply

1932
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,719
the such addresses for all the

1933
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,040
registered zones so

1934
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:28,080
that are accessible

1935
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,560
uh to the client in the current session

1936
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:31,440
and uh

1937
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:34,719
accept such addresses and the ep

1938
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,320
responses for all

1939
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,239
email reboots received

1940
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:44,879
from the server next slide please

1941
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:48,880
well we described the

1942
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,320
situation what happens when a client and

1943
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,199
server

1944
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,800
both support all the

1945
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,320
international addresses and now

1946
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,600
we should specify the behavior

1947
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,679
when the server

1948
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:10,639
supports session recently and doesn't

1949
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:12,800
and vice versa

1950
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,920
so uh

1951
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,280
if server supports uh

1952
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,239
ai and client does not uh then the

1953
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:22,960
server

1954
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,400
should validate the email

1955
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,840
property the email reports sent by

1956
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,760
client using the sqml validation rules

1957
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,800
and uh

1958
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:42,800
if uh clear if the email property is

1959
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:43,520
optional

1960
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,080
and the client supplies it the server

1961
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,560
should validate it uh

1962
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,719
using the ascii validation rules either

1963
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,600
then next slide please

1964
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,800
if a

1965
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,840
server sends a yamaha tribute in

1966
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,400
response

1967
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,440
the server should the the server must

1968
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,159
validate

1969
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,280
whether the email property is

1970
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,040
not asking one and if so

1971
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,440
the server should return the predefined

1972
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,040
or if it's asking it should remain

1973
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,360
it should return the original value of

1974
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,080
the email address

1975
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:34,400
uh when such uh

1976
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:39,679
attribute is optional uh server

1977
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,120
again must validate uh whether

1978
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,560
it's internationals or not and in case

1979
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,000
of a

1980
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,080
in case of ai it

1981
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:56,239
should not return the address but

1982
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,440
return it

1983
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,120
if it's asking next slide please

1984
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,360
uh when uh we have a client that

1985
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,080
supports

1986
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,840
uh yeah addresses but not supporting

1987
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,120
server

1988
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,760
when the property is required uh

1989
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,560
according to

1990
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,760
the ep syntax and the

1991
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,120
client has no alternative ask

1992
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:28,159
address but only international one the

1993
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:28,800
client

1994
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,800
must provide some predefined placeholder

1995
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,560
email address to indicate that

1996
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,080
in fact it's a

1997
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,000
international address

1998
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,280
when this property

1999
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,880
is optional and the client

2000
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,239
has only national address the client

2001
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,480
should emit the email property

2002
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:58,639
then next slide please

2003
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:04,080
so uh the placeholder address

2004
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:08,480
is not defined yet in the document

2005
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:13,120
uh i think that uh there are

2006
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:15,440
two possible options first of all is

2007
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,800
using some uh

2008
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:19,760
well-known address for example from

2009
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,000
example.com

2010
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,199
and the other possible option is uh

2011
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:26,159
using the

2012
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,679
registry specific address

2013
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:32,960
which can be set by the registry from

2014
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:33,679
one of

2015
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,440
the controlled

2016
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,760
namespaces to ensure that it will not

2017
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,280
clash with uh

2018
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:48,719
any really possible address

2019
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,400
uh the next slide please

2020
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,560
uh as we have a

2021
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,600
discussion on the mailing list

2022
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,880
as uh i think that uh

2023
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:07,360
it's important to add the support of the

2024
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,080
international email addresses to the ep

2025
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,000
protocol

2026
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,840
uh i kindly asked the working group

2027
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,440
to adopt this document

2028
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,120
and begin the process of

2029
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:25,920
working with it as a working documents

2030
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,560
many thanks

2031
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,360
okay thank you dmitry

2032
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,400
are there any questions

2033
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,120
or remarks

2034
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,159
though i understand correctly dimitri

2035
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,320
that you're requesting for this

2036
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,760
this document to be adopted

2037
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,080
yesterday yeah so the document itself

2038
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,840
and not the work right well because we

2039
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,159
had some discussion on the mailing list

2040
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,159
where we were still discussing whether

2041
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,480
or not there should be an extension

2042
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:05,360
or other documents that need to be

2043
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,520
adjusted

2044
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,760
so to be clear okay

2045
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,360
yes we have choose the option

2046
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,679
to remove the necessity of any extension

2047
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,920
and uh well we have a

2048
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,080
loophole we have a current synthetic

2049
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,440
that formula allows

2050
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:30,639
and uh this is so this is a

2051
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,480
document that just indicates that we

2052
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,840
should use this

2053
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,920
loophole okay very well thank you

2054
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:42,000
questions go ahead

2055
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,199
uh i have a comment

2056
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:50,800
i would say and that is i think in the

2057
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,080
case that the server requires an email

2058
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,960
address

2059
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:58,159
so the client has to send one i really

2060
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:00,360
don't think that the

2061
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:04,000
placeholder would actually work

2062
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,159
because that doesn't actually fulfill

2063
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,840
the requirement

2064
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,400
i mean for example you could have legal

2065
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,440
requirement to give your email address

2066
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:16,320
and so a placeholder wouldn't fulfill

2067
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,760
the requirement

2068
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,880
so i don't think that that is really an

2069
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,159
option to go here

2070
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:29,760
okay that's one the command thank you

2071
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:34,159
a fair point but uh i'm not sure it's

2072
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:37,920
in the scope of the iatf

2073
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:44,560
okay next one alexander go ahead

2074
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:48,639
uh thank you dimitri um

2075
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:51,040
let me say first that i appreciate the

2076
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,880
change that we don't need to support any

2077
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,639
kind of extension for this because i

2078
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,199
think that makes much more sensible

2079
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:00,960
and then a full extension

2080
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,080
secondly i think we need to double check

2081
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,880
this but

2082
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,440
as far as i know for just getting the

2083
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,600
namespace uri

2084
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:11,199
i don't think your an rsc is even

2085
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:14,000
required isn't it

2086
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,400
so the xml namespace registry is

2087
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,280
probably

2088
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,600
specification required so a local

2089
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,600
specification of your registry would

2090
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,199
probably do enough for the namespace

2091
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:24,800
registration

2092
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,199
um of course i understand that the the

2093
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:28,400
intent to to make

2094
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,360
is a standard or let you put it that way

2095
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,960
rc that goes through the

2096
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:35,360
the regex working group but it might not

2097
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,960
even be necessary

2098
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,239
yes yes uh there is no

2099
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,520
formalness there is no

2100
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:51,120
no no foreign space

2101
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,159
but i think it would be

2102
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:57,440
very useful to have a universal

2103
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,560
way to deal with uh

2104
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,840
international email addresses that

2105
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,880
can be used

2106
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:12,159
with all the registries and registers

2107
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:15,440
instead of currently

2108
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:21,839
locally defined operation practice

2109
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:26,320
okay next in line james squid

2110
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,840
james gold yep

2111
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,320
can you hear me yep yes ah there you go

2112
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,840
fantastic hey i wanted to um jump in and

2113
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,000
just to help the working group

2114
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,080
understand that this is a new

2115
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,480
form of epp extension so we said it's

2116
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,840
not an extension it really is an

2117
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,440
extension

2118
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:55,120
but it's a different form because it

2119
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,800
doesn't add any new elements it's

2120
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,360
actually an

2121
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,000
override of the existing elements that

2122
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,320
have been negotiated in the evp session

2123
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,760
so

2124
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,400
this provides for a lot more easy

2125
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,440
implementation

2126
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,480
but it's really important from a

2127
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,360
signaling perspective because if a

2128
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:15,199
server in fact supports

2129
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:18,400
international email addresses they can

2130
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,280
communicate that

2131
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,320
but they're committing to a specific

2132
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,800
set of behavior and similarly the client

2133
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,199
is also signaling and agreeing to a

2134
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,199
particular behavior as well

2135
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,560
um so yes you could go and register a

2136
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,600
name space

2137
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,040
but there's a lot more to it than

2138
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,880
registering a namespace there are

2139
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,679
certain

2140
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:41,840
obligations that are necessary for this

2141
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,440
to work

2142
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,360
and then in addition um i wanted to

2143
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,280
hit it on the placeholder text that is

2144
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,040
the probably the biggest item for this

2145
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,639
working group to

2146
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:56,400
figure out um because as i guess it was

2147
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,280
alexander that brought up the fact that

2148
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,040
there may be a legal requirement to do

2149
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:01,440
it

2150
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,000
but from a protocol perspective it's a

2151
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,159
required element it's up to server pulse

2152
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,960
and decide what to do with it if they

2153
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,560
require something other than the

2154
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,000
placeholder um

2155
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,199
so but there's not a whole lot of other

2156
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,880
options that we could think of

2157
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,040
because if it's required and the client

2158
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:20,480
doesn't have the appropriate

2159
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,840
value either they can't send it

2160
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:26,719
or the server will fail it or they pass

2161
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:27,280
a

2162
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,440
placeholder element and the server will

2163
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,480
accept it

2164
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:34,320
so that's it

2165
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,880
thank you thank you for that

2166
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,639
clarification i hope everybody

2167
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:41,199
understands it

2168
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,520
then that was the last enough too so

2169
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,280
dimitri i want to say if you

2170
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,280
formally want to have this document

2171
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,320
adopted send

2172
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,639
a an official request to the chairs and

2173
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:52,840
we will put out a formal call for

2174
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,360
adoption okay thank you very much

2175
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,920
i will send the formal request many

2176
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,520
thanks for

2177
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,719
the clarification on the procedure yeah

2178
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,639
and then we will do the rest of the work

2179
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:09,120
on the mailing list

2180
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,159
thank you jim next

2181
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:15,199
slide milestone review i think you will

2182
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:18,799
take up this point again jim

2183
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:23,199
or do you still have connection issues

2184
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:25,199
well uh my connection seems to be

2185
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,880
holding out so that's a good thing

2186
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,239
otherwise it would have dropped me like

2187
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,600
it did before and it dropped all the

2188
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,080
presentation

2189
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,280
sort of ugly okay um so

2190
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:40,560
uh you know as chairs we have tried oh

2191
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:40,960
uh

2192
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,800
james cool do you have your hand up is

2193
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,719
that an old hand organizing up

2194
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:49,520
oh removing from the key okay hold on um

2195
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,159
so uh you know the chairs got together

2196
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:54,719
and we just sort of made up a slide

2197
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:56,560
um and i'm being fair and telling you

2198
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,239
what's going on um

2199
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,440
you know we're trying to manage our

2200
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,840
milestones and um

2201
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,600
we don't seem to get a lot of input from

2202
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,679
folks here on the group so

2203
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,280
we just kind of made some stuff up here

2204
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,040
and that's just a way of leaning on

2205
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,480
folks and saying you know if you don't

2206
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,920
like it that's fine

2207
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,600
uh please propose something different

2208
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,440
that keeps things organized and

2209
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,920
we're happy to take that on board so the

2210
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,000
things which are in italics here

2211
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,280
are already on our milestone list

2212
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,920
the things that are not in italics are

2213
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:27,440
new items

2214
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,600
um and for the items that were on the

2215
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,600
list you you can see in parentheses

2216
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:32,080
there

2217
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:35,520
what the old uh milestone date was

2218
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,000
and so we're just proposing a new date

2219
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,840
and we've just kind of structured

2220
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,880
what we think uh appears to be

2221
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,400
the uh energy in the working group

2222
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,040
as far as moving things forward and and

2223
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:49,440
so

2224
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,600
we just kind of laid things out in that

2225
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:52,960
way um

2226
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,800
and gave ourselves a little time to go

2227
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,639
through the different documents so

2228
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,719
i mean there was a little bit of method

2229
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,400
in our methodology here

2230
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,480
but you know frankly it was just our

2231
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,800
view of what we see going on in the

2232
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:05,520
group

2233
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,239
um as always you know our work is

2234
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,159
dependent on people wanting to push it

2235
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:11,040
forward

2236
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,119
so if you feel like you want to jump on

2237
01:35:13,119 --> 01:35:15,360
something and move it along quicker

2238
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,560
then you know we're happy to uh

2239
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,800
negotiate uh some milestones here move

2240
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,080
stuff around

2241
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:24,400
we basically took a model of trying to

2242
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,239
order the documents in terms of what we

2243
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:28,400
think is most relevant

2244
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:31,119
and then we we deliberately just kind of

2245
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,800
chose every two months

2246
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,880
to sort of separate the documents a

2247
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,040
little bit i mean we seem to mostly do

2248
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:38,800
one thing at a time in this group

2249
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:40,400
just feels like the way that we tend to

2250
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,199
work best so we kind of ordered them

2251
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,560
uh based on what we think is um

2252
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,320
you know discussion that has to happen

2253
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,679
or is happening

2254
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:51,760
uh and you know again you you can

2255
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,199
disagree with us if you don't like this

2256
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:54,639
order

2257
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:56,320
registry maintenance um we're just kind

2258
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,239
of carrying forward we kind of figured

2259
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,080
that one's pretty close to done

2260
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,639
you know 7484 biz is a new document we

2261
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:04,080
just think we'll do that next because i

2262
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:05,360
don't think there's a lot

2263
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:07,119
of discussion or work that has to happen

2264
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,440
there um we just talked about rdap

2265
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,560
search a bit

2266
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,320
um i think this is a bit of discussion

2267
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,159
to have there about maybe

2268
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:16,480
changing uh a little bit or at least

2269
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,760
opening the question

2270
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,159
of what might be in the document uh

2271
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:20,880
that's my

2272
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,560
personal contribution as opposed to

2273
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,400
chair contribution

2274
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,719
so we kind of move things that way with

2275
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,480
registration reporting

2276
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,400
there's a bit of coordination to do with

2277
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,719
registrars on the icann side

2278
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:34,480
so it just felt like pushing that out a

2279
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:35,760
little bit seemed like the right thing

2280
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:36,400
to do

2281
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:37,840
allow some extra time for some

2282
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,080
discussion there on that topic

2283
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:43,760
um jscontact uh we do have a fairly

2284
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,840
significant issue to get through

2285
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,400
in terms of discussions about j card

2286
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,800
versus j is contact

2287
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,400
and part of the reason for pushing that

2288
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,000
out is not so much the technical

2289
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,119
discussion

2290
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,600
but also that sort of uh discussion

2291
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,040
about its status

2292
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,480
as compared to j-card um and

2293
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,440
in fairness i would imagine in this just

2294
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,600
like with registration reporting

2295
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,000
will reach out to do a little joint work

2296
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,960
specifically

2297
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,840
with icann's tech ops group uh where the

2298
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,600
registrars and their technical folks

2299
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,480
tend to sit

2300
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,320
and we'll will sort of create an interim

2301
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:19,760
meeting and an opportunity to have a

2302
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:20,880
joint meeting

2303
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,600
so we can get some really good input on

2304
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,520
that side with respect to that issue

2305
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,920
so it felt appropriate to push that out

2306
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,880
and then as scott

2307
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:32,320
kind of said with open id

2308
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:33,360
we're kind of waiting for the

2309
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:35,840
opportunity to um

2310
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,760
do some interoperability testing and

2311
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:39,520
implementation experience

2312
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,280
i mean yeah we kind of have a really

2313
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:42,880
nice document there

2314
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:46,400
um it seems pretty well uh pretty stable

2315
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,040
um but then again we're waiting for an

2316
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:49,920
external event

2317
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,920
you know we're expecting you know some

2318
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:54,159
policy work on the icann side

2319
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:57,360
that will motivate the deployment of

2320
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,280
some kind of authenticated queries in

2321
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:00,560
our dap

2322
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,199
and thus we will actually want to engage

2323
01:38:03,199 --> 01:38:04,400
in testing

2324
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,320
uh and trying some things out and seeing

2325
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,880
if it works and so it seems appropriate

2326
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,960
to hold that document for you know for

2327
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,960
that work to continue and to move on

2328
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,719
and scott you have a hand up so please

2329
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:16,560
if i misrepresented that

2330
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,600
um please do uh correct me

2331
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,520
yeah thanks jim scott holland back yeah

2332
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:23,679
i i should just remind folks that back

2333
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:24,639
when

2334
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:26,880
we were doing some of the original rdap

2335
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,760
pilot work

2336
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,880
in the icann context there were several

2337
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,080
implementations

2338
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,320
of this particular draft you know that

2339
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,840
demonstrated both function

2340
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,520
and interoperability right so

2341
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,280
you know modulo anything we might decide

2342
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,800
to change i mean i think we've already

2343
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,280
kind of checked that particular box

2344
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:47,840
um the real issue here is is there going

2345
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:48,560
to be anything

2346
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,119
changing in the policy space such that

2347
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:53,040
we have to change

2348
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,440
some of the you know proposals for

2349
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,239
registering

2350
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,520
attributes associated with identities

2351
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,040
okay i mean obviously that that's not

2352
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:02,639
all of it of course i mean over time

2353
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:03,840
things might we might have to change

2354
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:04,639
more

2355
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:06,880
but basic functionality we've got that

2356
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,400
nailed in fact there's an implementation

2357
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:09,920
status section in the document that

2358
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,719
describes

2359
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:14,560
some of those past successes already

2360
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,040
thanks for that scott um you know i

2361
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,639
agree with you you're absolutely right

2362
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:23,280
um you know the document really is

2363
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,119
pretty stable

2364
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,960
i guess you know just kind of stepping

2365
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,880
back a bit i might restate what i said

2366
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,040
in the form of um

2367
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,719
you know there's just no urgency for

2368
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,639
this at the moment

2369
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,080
um and so there's no pain if you will

2370
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:41,119
involved in pausing while we wait for

2371
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,639
some urgent need for it to give us a

2372
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:44,239
chance to test some things

2373
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,880
and and see how it really works um you

2374
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,040
know beyond just the the technical

2375
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,320
elements of it

2376
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,639
um so hopefully there's not a lot there

2377
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:54,239
but we're just giving ourselves time and

2378
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:54,880
keeping it

2379
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,320
letting it simmer i think that was the

2380
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,400
word to use scott but just let it simmer

2381
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,679
for a while longer

2382
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:02,400
um it's it's not in the way so anyway

2383
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,280
that's there

2384
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,840
we'll obviously have to add the eai

2385
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,040
document

2386
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,679
assuming we adopt that we'll we'll add

2387
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:10,159
that

2388
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:12,639
um you know that's it's not on the list

2389
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:14,000
at the moment because it's not yet

2390
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,040
adopted

2391
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,880
uh but if we get past that far we'll

2392
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,880
we'll slot that in here somewhere

2393
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,000
along the way um you know anyway

2394
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,159
again i guess the end of this is you

2395
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:25,440
know this is our proposal

2396
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,119
at least we'll update our milestones

2397
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:28,560
this way um

2398
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,320
in fairness you know we should send this

2399
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:31,760
off to the mailing list

2400
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,360
and just you know wait to see if there's

2401
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,880
any real discussion

2402
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:37,040
but um i would say that unless anyone

2403
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,400
objects or wants to make a different

2404
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,440
proposal

2405
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,920
uh we will update our milestones to

2406
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,199
reflect this

2407
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:45,360
uh sometime in the next couple of weeks

2408
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,960
um just so that we're

2409
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,280
accurately recording our level of effort

2410
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,360
and our work here

2411
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,840
and i guess that's it there's no other

2412
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,719
questions um back to you

2413
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:00,239
uh antoine yeah then

2414
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:04,000
we'll go to the next slide

2415
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,400
and that's actually the any other

2416
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,679

longest um

2481

sometimes i feel a little bit like the

2482
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:22,080
orphan working group we kind of like

2483
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:22,400
we're

2484
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,159
we're marching through area directors

2485
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:25,760
for a while they're like nobody really

2486
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,719
wanted us

2487
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:29,920
um but uh barry hung in there and kept

2488
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,679
us on the straight and narrow and

2489
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:33,520
and and has been very helpful to us a

2490
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:34,800
couple of times here

2491
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,480
as we bumped into some interesting

2492
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,080
situations but

2493
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,480

2511
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:21,679
short

2512
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,360
uh maybe maybe no no no i

2513
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:27,199
want i didn't want to share the screen i

2514
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:29,040
didn't want to send video

2515
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,840
there you go um i felt going to make an

2516
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,199
observation and that is

2517
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:35,360
i i think that we can we as a working

2518
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:37,280
group we can actually be pretty quick

2519
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,080
if we focus on a certain topic and that

2520
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:41,520
topic doesn't have any external

2521
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,400
dependencies

2522
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,800
yeah we get really slow when it gets to

2523
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:46,639
uh issues that are like

2524
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:48,639
a little bit outside of the scope of the

2525
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,239
working club let me put it

2526
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:51,840
like the privacy discussion on the

2527
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,360
reverse search thing

2528
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,800
because i think you would be able to

2529
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,760
like finalize the technical parts of

2530
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,800
that racine

2531
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,199
wii yeah and that that's true for a lot

2532
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,360
of the other drafts maybe as well as as

2533
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,960
soon as there is something that's

2534
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,080
like well either controversial uh

2535
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,719
or uh not not in the perfect technical

2536
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:11,920
part of the

2537
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,520
of the competence of the work group then

2538
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,440
it gets really slow so

2539
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:20,320
um and and for that i think that

2540
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:23,119
injury meetings focusing as a working

2541
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:24,960
session on a specific document with the

2542
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,679
interested

2543
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:28,960
people could work really well um

2544
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:30,560
and after that i think the only thing

2545
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,560
that we need to do is uh brought enough

2546
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,040
people

2547
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:35,040
to to say yes to the working group last

2548
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,360
call

2549
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:39,360
so that's maybe an observation with

2550
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:40,800
regards to the milestones because i

2551
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,360
think some of the milestones are like

2552
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:46,480
years out there in the future um and i

2553
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,159
think we should maybe reiterate all the

2554
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:50,080
milestones and look at whether

2555
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:53,280
any of those documents has any external

2556
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:55,520
or non-technical issue that prevents us

2557
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:58,159
from going forward yeah

2558
01:45:58,159 --> 01:46:00,400
i mean open ids for example an an

2559
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,480
example where we probably depend on on

2560
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,360
the

2561
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,239
on whatever uh cpa tech backups comes

2562
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:06,800
out

2563
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,320
together with the i can policy people um

2564
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,880
but there are hopefully other things on

2565
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,560
the milestones list which are which are

2566
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:16,239
quicker as soon as we find

2567
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:18,880
uh a group of a few people who are

2568
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,320
willing to spend

2569
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,159
an afternoon or maybe even two

2570
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:23,520
afternoons on it

2571
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:27,360
just an observation well thank you

2572
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,800
alex well coming back from my side is

2573
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,159
also that you know we are a small

2574
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:33,360
working group

2575
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,480
and we also realize you know that if

2576
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,560
there are five or ten people

2577
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:40,480
working on one document you cannot ask

2578
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:41,679
him to work on another document

2579
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,280
simultaneously

2580
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,960
that's that's also of course one of the

2581
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,400
observations that we have

2582
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,080
you know sometimes there's a lot of

2583
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:49,520
direction on the document and things

2584
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,719
goes fast

2585
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:54,320
and everybody agrees but sometimes

2586
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,880
it also takes time for people to to to

2587
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:57,679
read and

2588
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:00,560
and it's mostly the same people so yes i

2589
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:01,360
would ver

2590
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:03,440
i think jim and i would very much like

2591
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,880
you know everybody that's in the tech

2592
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:06,960
house to also be in the regex group

2593
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,920
but i only see 37 people on my screen

2594
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:10,639
now

2595
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:14,080
and not 100.

2596
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,880
yeah i think i'll just add one takeaway

2597
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,400
i took from what you said um

2598
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,119
alex i mean you're right um but one

2599
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:25,040
specific concrete takeaway i took from

2600
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,080
what you just said

2601
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,800
is we should make our milestones more

2602
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,400
visible to ourselves on a regular basis

2603
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,040
we don't often go through them you know

2604
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,560
we did this time because we kind of had

2605
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,480
a lot of publications last year with a

2606
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:39,679
lot of change

2607
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:42,800
so we we took a a visit of them but i

2608
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:44,480
know that other working groups tend to

2609
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,400
put the milestone list in front of

2610
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:48,880
themselves you know every meeting um and

2611
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,639
we should certainly do that

2612
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:52,480
uh and we can do that here for ourselves

2613
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:54,000
too we can make them more visible just

2614
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,840
to remind people of what's there in the

2615
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,199
documentation

2616
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:58,960
a second takeaway i took from what you

2617
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,800
said is inter meetings

2618
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,560
um i want to remind the working group

2619
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,320
that we've had some very successful

2620
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:05,920
inter meetings here

2621
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,000
the fee extension draft was one in

2622
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,400
particular that sticks out in my mind

2623
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:13,520
um you know it was roger and jody who

2624
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:15,280
had a particular interest in moving that

2625
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,800
forward and

2626
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:18,159
in fact they sponsored the interim

2627
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,719
meetings um and you know they were

2628
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:23,760
uh uh you know set up and had they were

2629
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:24,320
they were

2630
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,880
um remote meetings so it wasn't even a

2631
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,400
physical meeting that you had to go be

2632
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:28,960
there

2633
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,800
um and they really worked out very well

2634
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,400
they were they were specific

2635
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,239
a working meeting they had an agenda

2636
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,719
technical issues and it was just focused

2637
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:39,119
um and and so i think that that helped

2638
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:40,719
move that document along it languished

2639
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,000
for a long time

2640
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,600
until those guys picked it up and moved

2641
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,199
it along and so that opportunity

2642
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:47,679
exists and you know we'll support that

2643
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:49,840
uh and the itef has facilities for

2644
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,119
supporting that too

2645
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,679
if you need a way to run the meeting but

2646
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:54,800
you know i mean there's no

2647
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,400
obligation really as long as a group of

2648
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:58,000
people want to meet as long as you

2649
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,639
declare it and make it open for anybody

2650
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:02,000
you can have any kind of meeting you

2651
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,639
want any way that you want

2652
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:06,880
there's no real requirements except that

2653
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:07,920
it'd be visible

2654
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,960
and possible for you know people to join

2655
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,040
uh and and we'll help you and support

2656
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:14,159
that so

2657
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,840
um you know thanks for that alex those

2658
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,280
are my two key takeaways from what you

2659
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:17,760
said

2660
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,040
i agree with everything else you said

2661
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,199
too

2662
01:49:24,239 --> 01:49:28,800
okay then if there is no any other other

2663
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,400
business

2664
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:32,880
then i think we had a very successful

2665
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,239
meetings we

2666
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:38,320
give you back 10 minutes of your time

2667
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,440
and we'll talk to each other in the

2668
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,400
mail on the mailing list so thank you

2669
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:45,119
all

2670
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:49,520
meeting adjourned thank you

2671
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,800
oh minutes i need to collect the minutes

2672
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:57,840
thank you alex for taking the minutes
