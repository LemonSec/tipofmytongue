1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,839
okay

2
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,439
um we are at the top of the hour there's

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
still a couple people that i'm expecting

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,039
who aren't here yet so i might wait

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,039
another minute or two

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
um and then there's one person i

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,720
realized it did not actually confirm

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,558
whether or not he planned

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,480
to talk about his draft but i had put

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,559
him on the agenda

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,440
um i don't see him here yet

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,960
let's see um

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,840
oh there's uh

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,840
my apologies the draft the time and date

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
you've just vanished from our audio

16
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,840
the slides as well

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,839
the wonders of internet connections

18
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
oh you know i'm talking away and i had

19
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
muted myself

20
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:37,840
i wonder why i vanished

21
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,480
okay am i back now online

22
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
no idea why i vanished but

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
all right so it's 1102 i think we should

24
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
probably go ahead and get started

25
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
um

26
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
i think we have most of the people i'm

27
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,159
expecting except for one

28
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:18,800
okay so

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,239
uh welcome to the ntp working group

30
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:33,200

this is our agenda for today um

44
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,239
i did not allocate time to each of these

45
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,840
and it got a little bit longer than i

46
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,920
expected so we'll have to keep an eye on

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
the clock

48
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,639

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,000
uh so uh are there uh so dieter has

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
agreed to take minutes is there anybody

51
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
else that wants to help him

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,800
nope um

53
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,280
and is are there any agenda bashes

54
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,240
nope um

55
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,320
the next thing is uh

56
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
ntp working group status uh

57
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,840
document status the

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
we are making progress uh we

59
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,400
uh the yang data model has gone through

60
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,759
last call

61
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,840
an updated draft has been submitted

62
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
and i know that the editors of that are

63
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,520
not available today

64
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
i believe that the work is between eric

65
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,039
and the

66
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,080
chairs uh

67
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,560
command modes i just realized that we

68
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,320
lost track of this one

69
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,320
um and i believe erica has been through

70
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,520
last call

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
it has a discuss on it

72
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,120
and i believe that brian has answered

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
o'brien has answered

74
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
all of the questions we decided on a way

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,160
forward but we have never circled back

76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,280
to

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,039
ben to resolve that discuss so um

78
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,759
i have i have uh tracked that there's i

79
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,880
thought there were three

80
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
things that were not yet resolved um i

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
took some notes i have a little bug

82
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
tracking system

83
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
um he was okay with uh the md5 stuff as

84
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,080
long as we

85
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
reverted the status to historic which we

86
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,120
did

87
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
um but there was a question of uh

88
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,479
there's a 20

89
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,919
bit versus 24-bit uh field he felt was

90
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,360
then felt was confusing and i think

91
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
there was one or two other points that i

92
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
did not see

93
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
any uh changes in the doc addressing

94
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,120
that

95
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
okay so i missed the fact that there was

96
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,039
additional things that he needed

97
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,120
addressed so i thought that the latest

98
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,080
update

99
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
addressed everything so that's a

100
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
miscommunication

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,360
i think um yeah i can send you uh and uh

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,039
uh brian uh my recollection of the notes

103
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,000
and try to try to pick that stuff up ben

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,960
did ping me

105
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,360
a couple times saying are you waiting on

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
me are you waiting on me

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,800
and every time i was dealing with uh

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,479
other documents and other things

109
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,199
so yeah i don't think we're waiting on

110
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
him

111
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,880
and

112
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,120
what i believe is is the remaining thing

113
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
okay that that would be uh that would be

114
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,840
very helpful thank you

115
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
the port randomization document is

116
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,080
moving through

117
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
uh it has been submitted it has been

118
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,759
reviewed

119
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,840
um it's on its way i don't think there's

120
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,960
any big blockers there

121
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,440
i just went away from my data tracker

122
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,840
window

123
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,080
right so that's with uh with you

124
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
and then that leaves two that are ready

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
for the isg that need to be submitted

126
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
um i completely forgot about the tick

127
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,000
tock document so i have moved it over to

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,560
here

129
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,160
so that we will do a better job of

130
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,639
keeping track of that one and the ntp

131
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,360
interleave modes are ready to go

132
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,599
so we'll get those done right after this

133
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,159
ietf

134
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,520
and with that that is the end of our

135
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
documents that we don't have on the

136
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,160
agenda to talk about today

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,680

138
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599

143
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,599
significant changes

144

just few sentences rewarded

145
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,800
to make them more clear there were

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,240
suggestions from

147
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,839

157
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
and we are ready to move it to working

158

172
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,040
wrote it all up because some of them

173
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,600
were just sort of implied

174
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,000
um and um

175
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
yeah there will be an issue i think for

176
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
discussion on the working group list

177
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
uh some of the nts registries were

178
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
partitioned into different spaces

179
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
but since you know it's like oh you can

180
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,360
have the low order byte

181
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
of a four byte field or something like

182
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
that um

183
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
it sort of reminds me of the old bsd

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
reserved ports thing

185
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
um so we'd have to resolve that issue

186
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
but other than that

187
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,880
i don't think there's any controversy i

188
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
did

189
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
have um iana pre-review it

190
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,120
just to make sure that it answered all

191
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
the questions and fit what the current

192
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
standards are for ayana request these

193
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
days

194
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,079
so that's it it's a short doc

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,320
um okay

196
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,399
so uh marcus you're in the queue

197
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,079
yeah can you guys hear me yes yes and

198
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,760
possibly also see me in a

199
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,360
few seconds um so i read through the

200
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,120
document yesterday and

201
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,880
um it all makes sense to me that we

202
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,800
try and make sure we have the same sort

203
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
of requirements and specifications for

204
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
the registries

205
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,640
the only thing i sort of i'm missing

206
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,040
here

207
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,320
is a motivation for

208
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
why we've chosen certain policies such

209
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
as for example

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,760
specifications required and

211
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
i i i have no problem with picking that

212
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
as a policy for

213
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,640
all registries um but i'm

214
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
i'd really like to read a couple of

215
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,160
sentences on

216
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,680
why we picked that one

217
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,839
okay yeah exactly you mean um

218
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,800
sure uh i just put it in because i've

219
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,600
been

220
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
one of the tls designated experts for

221
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
years

222
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,639
um and it just seemed the way that more

223
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,040
things were going

224
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,560
um if we wanted you know

225
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,480
the other advantage well yeah i don't

226
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
have a strong feeling one way or the

227
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,320
other

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,839
whatever the working group wants to do

229
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,680
i know that's like sort of a not answer

230
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
it was just like arbitrary

231
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,920
based on my experience it seemed

232
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
designated you know expert review

233
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,079
was better it could also

234
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,000
the experts could be given instructions

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,839
to partition the space for only

236
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,560
standards to track things being having

237
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,279
the low order port number low order

238
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,160
extensions

239
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,760
if that's really what we want but

240
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,560
yeah i'm not a complete answer but the

241
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,518
best i got so far

242
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
okay uh

243
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,440
any other questions on this draft

244
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,519
okay so for this one we're asking to

245
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,079
adopt it as a working group draft is

246
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,959
there anybody who

247
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,720
has any sees any reasons at this point

248
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:35,839
why we shouldn't issue the call for that

249
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,839
all right um yakov

250
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,040
question is um assuming this is adopted

251
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,680
this is

252
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,800
basically going to be an rfc which is

253
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,599
only an ayana considerations section

254
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,720
some of the history i mean

255
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
the outcome of it is yes it's only

256
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
ayanna stuff

257
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,199
but it also describes what some of the

258
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,880
fields are and gives a summary so

259
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,000
anybody who hadn't done all of the other

260
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
reading or wanted to know

261
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,959
how do i add an nts extension this would

262
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,480
give them a chance to

263
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,320
figure it out yes so

264
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
yeah so i i i think we can make these

265
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
changes an iana request we wouldn't

266
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,320
really absolutely have to have a draft

267
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,040
at all

268
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
um but i i i think i think i think an

269
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
informational rfc is the right way to go

270
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,639
here

271
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,279
so what what the reason i asked it first

272
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,959
of all i've never seen an rfc which has

273
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,040
only an iana consideration section

274
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,360
but what i wanted to suggest is instead

275
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,639
have first a uh

276
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,760
several sections which explain what

277
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,079
each of the parameters does and then

278
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:54,800
have an

279
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,120
a typical ayana consideration section

280
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,040
which says ayami is instructed

281
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
on a abcd um

282
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,480
so did you read the draft yeah i just

283
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,120
read it right now

284
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,680
it's not yeah i i agree i think it's

285
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,440
just rearranging the material that's

286
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,839
there

287
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,120
it's not not that there's something

288
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,440
missing

289
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
okay

290
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
okay um

291
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
any other comments on this draft

292
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,000
all right so thank you rich we will

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,079
do a call for adoption on the mailing

294
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,839
list

295
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
uh next up on the agenda is chronos

296
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,320
uh neta if you want to

297
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
do you want to do your own slides or do

298
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
you want us to share them for you

299
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:55,839
very great um

300
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,839
okay i'm going to share my screen

301
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,160
and

302
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,240
if you want i i send you a request for

303
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,800
it for a

304
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,479
screen sharing

305
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,040
okay we can also do it with victoria i

306
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,160
think i've history

307
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,600
i've hit the green check mark i think

308
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,040
it's thinking about whether it's going

309
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,600
to get

310
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,480
or not okay

311
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,839
how about now yes

312
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,079
um and today i'm going to present the

313
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,600
current state of our work

314
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
and the entity security the joint port

315
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,880
with the

316
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,160
uh danidoleth and mikhail shapiro

317
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,079
um

318
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,199
yeah so a short reminder um we consider

319
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,119
a default tweet model where the attacker

320
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,400
has a fully controlled

321
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,919
of larger um a

322
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,839
fraction of the ntp pool so a quarter he

323
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,079
can

324
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,319
exchange the content of the mtp

325
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,760
responses and also

326
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,679
delay them and of course and that up

327
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,119
here is malicious and try to shift the

328
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,959
client's clock as much as possible

329
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
uh as you can see in this picture they

330
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,960
claim to receive

331
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,640
as you know were both good and bad

332
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,160
samples and uh

333
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,200
he might choose the a shifted one um

334
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,760
therefore we suggest to the uh modified

335
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,720
ndp clients

336
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
named homos with the following

337
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
characteristics it has a probable

338
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,360
security

339
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
which means that we can bound the

340
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,799
successful probability of an attacker to

341
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,200
shift

342
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,240
time even for a minute in the middle uh

343
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,960
it has backward compatibilities since

344
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
there is no need to change anything in

345
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,919
the mtp servers and

346
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,559
we are mostly based on the standard ntp

347
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,360
client

348
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
and we end only small like computation

349
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,919
and communication overhead

350
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,200
uh as with very small number of servers

351
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
uh and also a reminder of a home

352
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,280
solution

353
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,720
also on the uh one hand we use a big

354
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,360
a pool of ndp servers on the other hand

355
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
and we choose uh it random only a

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,280
tens ntp servers and sample them and

357
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,080
lastly we use a smart filters in order

358
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
to remove

359
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
small filters in order to remove our

360
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,280
lives sorry

361
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,039
um however we found a that calls has

362
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,000
some limitations and first of all it

363
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,679
relies on hundreds of servers

364
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,640
which are not available in many regions

365
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,679
and the second

366
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
is that it's a queries randomly selected

367
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,360
servers

368
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,080
which might be dependent on each other

369
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,720
due to

370
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,080
ntp hierarchical architecture

371
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
and therefore an attacker who directly

372
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,360
controlled even

373
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,400
just few of them might influence many

374
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
others

375
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,960
and we quantified the influence of an

376
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
attacker on the pool

377
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,880
based on the number of servers uh he

378
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,919
controlled

379
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
in control sorry um so a server

380
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,559
server is influenced by an attacker as

381
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,280
you know

382
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,919
if the attacker controls the majority of

383
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:22,640
the

384
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,760
servers it's synchronized with so here

385
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,400
in the

386
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
x-axis um of this graph

387
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
is the number of servers directly

388
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,280
controlled by the attacker

389
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,840
and in the y-axis of each of these two

390
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,400
graphs um

391
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,440
the the shifted or the influence servers

392
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,360
ratio out of hundreds

393
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,200
so for example uh in the um

394
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,520
i mean figure in the left an attacker

395
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,039
who gains control over

396
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,880
20 and of the most popular time servers

397
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,200
in

398
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,799
germany can shift time of 52 percent

399
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,520
of the time servers in this country and

400
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,320
similarly

401
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,360
and controlling 44 time servers in north

402
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,640
america and is sufficient for shifting

403
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
time or at 40 percent of the

404
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,080
service in this region out of

405
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,039
approximately

406
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,080
and 900 so

407
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,919
we can see that controlling a small

408
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,120
subset of servers in a region

409
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
gave the attacker the ability to shift

410
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,959
time as many other servers

411
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,440
therefore we suggest a as it was

412
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
published in the last ndss

413
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,559
and this february um

414
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,919
to add a new pool called which avoids

415
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,559
the dependency issues

416
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,480
the servers in an ikea should be

417
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,559
structural one-time servers

418
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,200
which are independent of each other and

419
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,320
to make it harder

420
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
from the for the attacker to inject time

421
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,799
servers the servers in a 9k should uh

422
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,520
belong to

423
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,159
a reputable organization and if the

424
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:58,799
future

425
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,840
servers may er may be added by some

426
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,799
trust to the

427
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,679
authority and i should include hundreds

428
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,159
of

429
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,480
such servers for security reasons

430
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,520
however

431
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,159
their reliance on a stratum one service

432
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,880
only

433
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,960
and force us to use geographically

434
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,720
dispersed servers which may affect

435
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,039
time and time currency and precision

436
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,880
therefore we propose um um that each and

437
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,679
every client will run simultaneously

438
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,600
to parallel medicine and synchronization

439
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,360
process um this

440
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,840
the first one is primary process which

441
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,600
is identical to the one that is used

442
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,640
today

443
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,919
such as the default ntp v4 or in the

444
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,960
future ndp

445
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
find client and the synchronized with

446
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,720
the a pool sign

447
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,760
servers in this region and the second

448
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,280
one

449
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,679
is what you watch the process and that

450
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,480
consists of

451
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,200
honest clients we synchronize with a

452
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
service in a number

453
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,880
um the title of the clients

454
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,240
is a um sorry and the title

455
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
of the client is updated and

456
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,400
by the preliminary process unless

457
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
uh it's time dvd there is time deviation

458
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,039
uh between the client the

459
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,760
entity before client and the workshop

460
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,240
time

461
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,080
and in this case the client's time is

462
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,799
updated by the watchtower

463
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,679
and now let's let's see how um

464
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
enantiomer may affect

465
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,679
the time currency precision and not

466
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,799
balancing

467
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,120
so to measure these and differences we

468
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,640
use clients in different

469
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,080
region uh to query and query

470
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,280
ntp servers across other regions

471
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,960
and for example as you can see here in

472
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,360
this um

473
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,280
figure on the left and we place clients

474
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,240
in the uk

475
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,600
and query service inside the uk pool

476
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,880
um in europe u.s and global servers

477
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,360
the gap between the offsets achieved in

478
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
by querying inside the uk

479
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
and query on other regions were

480
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,039
was six milliseconds and we got the

481
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,720
similar results say for clients in

482
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,440
ireland germany and in the us

483
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,840
following these measurements uh we can

484
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,159
configure

485
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,200
the watch that take taking over only

486
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,400
when the

487
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,039
it's offset is far from the mtp's offset

488
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,320
like approximately

489
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,639
um

490
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,640
sorry 50 milliseconds and

491
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,039
and we can see that it provides both

492
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,000
good precision

493
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,640
and security for the four ingredients

494
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,200
and

495
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,960
in the absence of uh um of attack

496
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,760
and i'm care offset and will be a only

497
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,159
few million seconds away

498
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,120
even when using x region servers and

499
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,039
therefore in this case an empty will not

500
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,679
be used

501
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,400
and the existing typical currency and

502
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,080
precision are maintained

503
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,039
only when there is an attack we expect

504
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:05,919
to get a

505
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,799
large offset gap and in this case using

506
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,640
it out here and will prevent

507
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
time shifting this way we accept to get

508
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,159
um

509
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,440
an offset within a few milliseconds from

510
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
the quick time even during an attack

511
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,240
and regarding low balancing know that

512
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,960
the

513
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
in the primary process and tpp before

514
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
low balancing is they used

515
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,840
this um we suggest that in the watchdog

516
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,440
process the query rate

517
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,919
of non-care service will be much lower

518
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,279
than the ntp

519
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,919
uh query rate and more precisely

520
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,880
considering that

521
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,039
only around 10 percent of the ntp

522
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,120
servers are structuring one service

523
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,240
the query rate of watch that should be

524
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,799
respectably and lower

525
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,480
um and here we show the lower bond of

526
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,360
the expected time of successful time

527
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,880
shift

528
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,240
and we when we consider an anarchy pool

529
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
with a 200

530
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,080
a time service when they watch their

531
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,360
queries 12

532
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,960
of them every 10 sec hours

533
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,400
and even after an extreme case where

534
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,520
um uh when

535
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,880
many of them uh this

536
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,960
service in an iqr control seventh of

537
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,039
them are controlled by the attacker

538
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,799
shifting time and declines by a a 1.1

539
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,679
millisecond

540
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,679
for example from the hcc will take the

541
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,640
stacker at least 26 years in expectation

542
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,679
and so to conclude we consider that

543
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,880
in a an attacker's an attack strategy to

544
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
of exploiting inter servers dependencies

545
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,279
we apparently quantify the impact of

546
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,000
this attack

547
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,320
and showing that it can cause

548
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,080
significant harm

549
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,919
finally we propose um

550
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,640
a scheme for improvement and db security

551
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,000
within again

552
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
which we preserve today time currency

553
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,880
precision and loan balancing so in draft

554
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,559
zero two in the last draft uh we

555
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,480
addressed the comment we got from

556
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,320
uh the the working group regarding the

557
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,039
a watchdog mechanism and its a default

558
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:21,919
parameters

559
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,720
and we thank a ownish and what's up

560
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,799
what's on and i hope i

561
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,559
pronounced this name well and sorry for

562
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,640
having um for useful discussion

563
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
a and next we will update the draft to

564
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,279
include an uncaseful option

565
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,400
and we can we continue to work on

566
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,720
implementing a

567
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,120
and honors as a watchdog of mpp before

568
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,840
and

569
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,360
and we continue to evaluate uh homes and

570
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,080
enam

571
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,520
performance and security and that's all

572
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,440
if you have questions

573
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,840
okay uh anacia

574
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,329
[Music]

575
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,159
here

576
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,279
go ahead ignacio

577
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,799
can you all hear me yes

578
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,240
you can't hear me uh ignacio we'll come

579
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,440
back to you watson do you want to go

580
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
ahead

581
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,080
yeah so this what you presented is

582
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,760
different from the draft that's fine

583
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,600
but once we start getting into saying

584
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,799
we're going to deploy

585
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,520
servers around the world that we trust

586
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,080
that

587
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,320
is effort that could get you much

588
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,480
stronger security guarantees if they

589
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,159
were running rough time

590
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,320
and if or if they were running nts as

591
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,279
well

592
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,679
so it seems that once you're putting a

593
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,039
nanka in

594
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,200
the relevance and the other thing is the

595
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,320
issue with the

596
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,520
query rate isn't well-behaved clients

597
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,960
the issue is that any ntp server you

598
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,919
operate

599
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,000
can be abused and the demands of serving

600
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,039
for you know a huge amount of huge by

601
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,440
some

602
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,320
by 90 standards now ntp traffic aren't

603
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
that great

604
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,360
so at this point when you have these

605
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,559
trusted servers around the world you

606
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,440
start thinking okay

607
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,640
why do i even need to again

608
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,320
what what do they even so

609
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,960
you know the performance that we've seen

610
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,360
with

611
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,880
sort of the the uh cloudflare ips

612
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,120
server which is publicly available is

613
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
that it can serve

614
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,200
hundreds of thousands of requests over

615
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,520
the question but it seems like what you

616
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
are asking is that um

617
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,520
if you are using an unkid pool and we

618
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,919
know and we all know that it's a

619
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
more secure and uh um and

620
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,320
and so on um and what do we you

621
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,600
need a a chronos at all but

622
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,720
as you were saying every server can can

623
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,279
be

624
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,399
and can be a talk

625
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,279
so um and this is why i think that

626
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,799
if we have calls and if we are going to

627
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,480
a to use um a water gun away

628
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,919
so why won't we um

629
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,360
double the the security we can have

630
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,360
which means both a using um um

631
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,799
secure more secure servers and

632
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,840
and i used a whole

633
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,960
algorithm for um for dropping outliners

634
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,840
among this group

635
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,679
is that unserious question

636
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,000
um

637
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
go ahead watson did you want to respond

638
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,080
or yeah

639
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,240
sorry i didn't quite catch that but yeah

640
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,919
i i i think it's something that we'll

641
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,600
discuss on the list and once the next

642
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,120
draft comes out we see exactly what the

643
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,720
proposal is

644
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,640
okay that'd be great an aco do you want

645
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,440
to try again you said

646
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,760
oh he's going to write in the chat

647
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,840
instead i think oh wait no go ahead

648
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,159
i think he's going to chat all right so

649
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:58,960
next up is

650
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,080
um so are there any other questions for

651
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,200
um

652
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,240
netapp nope okay great uh so

653
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,559
thank you thank you very much thank you

654
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,600
um so watson uh

655
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,279
rough time did you want me to do the

656
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,760
slides are you gonna do them

657
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
is your screen request um you should

658
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
present the slides

659
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,720
and i'll just okay everybody can see me

660
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,039
everybody can hear me

661
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,880
yes great thank you for

662
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,399
sharing the screens i don't have to

663
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,399
fiddle around

664
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,159
okay just give me uh two seconds to make

665
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:40,799
sure

666
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,640
i have what i need

667
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,960
all right

668
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
all right so i'm going to be talking

669
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,240
about the new

670
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:01,840
uh rough time draft next slide please

671
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,919
all right well i think we'll just have

672
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,320
to deal with that

673
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,320
i'll try not to touch the table maybe

674
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
switch off your camera

675
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
for a moment to see whether that fixes

676
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
the audio

677
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,399
this is bad before okay now

678
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,600
that was better better

679
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,720
no all right um

680
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,799
okay i can try a different microphone is

681
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,760
this better

682
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,200
that's perfect okay

683
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,720
weird all right um so

684
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,120
next slide please

685
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
so rough time is certificate

686
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,799
transparency for time

687
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,919
so the idea is by having servers sign

688
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,880
their responses

689
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,000
we can detect cheating we can detect

690
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,399
time that is invalid within the limits

691
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:11,919
of the round trip time

692
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,039
this solves real problems it solves real

693
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:15,760
problems

694
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,399
for certificate verification in browsers

695
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,120
it solves

696
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,159
the bootstrapping issues where we need

697
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,360
an authorized source of time independent

698
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,399
from epsilon certificate verification it

699
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,399
has been its early versions of it have

700
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,640
been adopted

701
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,279
and have seen real uses in ethereum v2

702
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,760
sorry about the audio because i think i

703
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,559
can't think of anything else to try

704
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,480
um now on that one

705
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,200
tried the other day um so it's been

706
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,960
adopted but the early versions have been

707
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,679
adopted

708
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,279
and seen real use in ethereum area

709
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,240
channel

710
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
uh next live slides

711
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,840
uh so next nine exercises

712
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,050
[Applause]

713
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
uh

714
00:34:46,839 --> 00:35:03,839
back all right

715
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,680
is this better

716
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,839
now

717
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,200
okay um

718
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,280
all right so okay

719
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,079
i think i know what the problem is i'll

720
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,200
fiddle with it later

721
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,800
but what's working now is working and

722
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,599
so this is so draft dash 03 is going to

723
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,800
be our interrupt target because there's

724
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,160
no wire changes

725
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,880
we think we need to make um the changes

726
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,240
have just been editorial

727
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,560
then the second draft which is much less

728
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,280
advanced

729
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,320
is draft iatf ntp

730
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,359
rough time ecosystem.00 and it defines a

731
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,880
broader ecosystem of

732
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,760
how do clients report on malfeasance how

733
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,800
do

734
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
how do people check that servers are

735
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,800
actually operating correctly

736
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,119
um trust you know what are the trust

737
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,280
anchors how do you define them

738
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,640
there's much more work needed here

739
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,240
because there's a bunch of serialization

740
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,680
formats that we haven't thought about

741
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
before

742
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,760
and like certificate transparency this

743
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,960
is an ecosystem

744
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,640
it needs deployments it needs

745
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,240
independently operated

746
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,520
servers and checkers and

747
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,079
this can update much more independently

748
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:24,880
because

749
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,000
servers do not need to make any changes

750
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
no matter what changes making ecosystem

751
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
parts clients might need to make small

752
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,079
changes but they don't really if you

753
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:34,320
have

754
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,599
any sort of format to store your trusted

755
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,040
server list in

756
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,359
that will work for you and later you can

757
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,520
update to use a more standardized one

758
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,200
for interoperability purposes if it

759
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,800
makes sense

760
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,160
you can always take advantage of the

761
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,079
checkers once we have those defined

762
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,960
the existing server base will work next

763
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,839
slide please

764
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,880
uh other changes so marcus is now a

765
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
co-author

766
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,560
it's extremely possible that when i was

767
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,920
chopping these apart that i made

768
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,560
mistakes

769
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,320
and sentences don't make sense anymore

770
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
there are sections missing

771
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,480
uh there have been typo fixes there are

772
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,240
always going to be typo fixes

773
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,160
um so that's that's most of the other

774
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,359
changes

775
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,839
and now last slide

776
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,040
are there any questions for me

777
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,839
any questions

778
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,480
okay um it has been pointed out

779
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,760
that uh perhaps i should have done a uh

780
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,440
call for adoption for the second

781
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,839
document

782
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,640
so i'm asking if there's any opposition

783
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,480
to us having

784
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,079
just accepted it as a working group

785
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,920
document as they split out of the

786
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,599
first document i was assuming since they

787
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,760
were one document

788
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,839
on the topic we were just making it two

789
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,119
was not

790
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,839
a uh not an issue so

791
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,480
yeah i mean i i don't see that we need a

792
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,680
cfa for that at all

793
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,359
we've we've we've adopted the first

794
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,040
document the editors decided to split it

795
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,680
into two

796
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
it's now two working group documents as

797
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,640
far as i'm concerned

798
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,800
okay um all right so

799
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,640
uh these documents are progressing if

800
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
anybody has any comments

801
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,240
please take them to the mailing list uh

802
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,560
next on the agenda is a

803
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,000
presentation that a topic that came from

804
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,599
the dispatch meeting yesterday

805
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,720
and do you want me to show your slides

806
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,079
or are you going to

807
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,680

otherwise i can try to

812
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,800

everyone

821
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,480
uh and usually i work at

822
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,240
egalia and i've been working on

823
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,280
this format for expressing dates and

824
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,320
times on the internet

825
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,640
which is something of a solved problem

826
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,839
if you ask many

827
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,960
but it's not completely solved yet as

828
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,079
i'd show

829
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,320
in the next few slides uh if you could

830
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
progress

831
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,440
just a little bit yeah so before you ask

832
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,800
uh i am a delegate

833
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,760
of tecma tc39 we've been standardizing

834
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,640
uh different

835
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,359
additions to the javascript language one

836
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:15,920
of which

837
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,079
is called temporal which is what i'm

838
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,520
working on it is

839
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,079
a ergonomic api for dealing with dates

840
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,000
and times

841
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
something that we've worked on for the

842
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,040
last couple of years

843
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,400
and and it

844
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,119
introduces new ways to think about dates

845
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,160
and times uh

846
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,800
in ways that we've not discussed

847
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,520
previously

848
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,920
so that's really interesting the problem

849
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,280
that we come up with

850
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,440
once somebody uh deals with time zones

851
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,640
and calendars

852
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,680
sort of first-class objects is

853
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,839
how do you include that information

854
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:53,280
during persistence

855
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,480
right uh and if you progress these

856
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,440
slides a little bit

857
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,680
we have this as the as the

858
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,400
okay yeah we have the format specified

859
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,240
by rc pvp9

860
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,880
which is perfect for representing

861
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,000
instance in time

862
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,800
but any additional information is lost

863
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,200
uh

864
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,440
and this is a known problem the time

865
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,480
zone conundrum

866
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,079
as one might say is different

867
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,640
applications realizing that they need a

868
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,680
human time zone

869
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,079
in addition to the instant in addition

870
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,119
to the offset

871
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,240
and therefore adding a

872
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,640
time zone to to that uh

873
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,880
if you see a bunch of databases like

874
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,160
post race or

875
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,040
uh oracle or just you know daytime apis

876
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,920
like java

877
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,440
or linux2 like the date binary a bunch

878
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,760
of

879
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,839
people have come up with interesting

880
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,760
ways to include that information none of

881
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,119
which unfortunately

882
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,480
is in the standard track uh so it's

883
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,200
it's it needs to be standardized and

884
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,119
what's more is i do not see the screen

885
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,640
yet

886
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,520
but okay can you progress it one more

887
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,920
slide

888
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,680
okay uh yeah these are the different

889
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,520
formats that people came up with and

890
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,040
and if you go one more

891
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,839
yeah so we need a generalized format to

892
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,800
avoid

893
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,480
uh you know more people coming up with

894
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,800
these

895
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,040
this problem and trying to hammer their

896
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,200
own extensions into things right

897
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,280
uh there's so many things that need that

898
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,480
can be expressed

899
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,760
in our case there was calendars uh

900
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,119
and yeah a generalized format would help

901
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,319
people

902
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,640
figure out the way to add more

903
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,440
information

904
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,319
in a cohesive manner so if you progress

905
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,040
to the

906
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,030
final fight i think uh

907
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,440
[Music]

908
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,000
yeah just just this one is good so this

909
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,839
is how we use the calendar extension

910
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,800
which is

911
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,440
you know on the left you see 359 format

912
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,480
and then

913
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
uh there's an extension for the time

914
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,920
zone which is as i mentioned not

915
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,119
standardized but

916
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,520
i think it's common uh you can you can

917
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,720
find it on the internet

918
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,760
and then there's uh you know

919
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,720
a version of the of the proposed

920
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,680
extension

921
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,920
uh that can be used to represent the

922
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,839
calendar

923
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,680
so we've talked about it in dispatch we

924
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,040
talked about it yesterday

925
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,480
and the idea is that we're going to

926
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,359
stand uh sorry to charter a new work

927
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:35,760
group

928
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,280
called sedate to

929
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,520
to discuss this and hopefully publish

930
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,040
this as an rfc

931
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,480
uh it was brought to my notice that

932
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,720
people here would possibly be interested

933
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,319
in this so i'd love to hear your

934
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,800
thoughts and

935
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,640
comments

936
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,920
watson hello

937
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,160
sorry for subjecting you to the noise of

938
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
my laptop's fans taking off

939
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,599
um one issue is

940
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,720
that the choice of calendar will affect

941
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,680
the definition of day

942
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,680
and the other and so then when you have

943
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,599
a time

944
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,200
it's it gets very messy because

945
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,800
if you're representing another i mean

946
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,480
there's calculations they're also

947
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,240
they're also uh dependent on where on

948
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,680
the earth you are

949
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,960
so i think if you're going to add

950
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,520
calendrical data here

951
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,720
it's going to be a huge huge

952
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,760
mess to convert and you're going to need

953
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,359
to put in location data as well

954
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,760
yeah the the idea is

955
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,680
that the the instant remains the same

956
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,880
as specified by 339 it's always the

957
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,200
left part right in the green part in

958
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,920
this

959
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,319
particular slide and any additional

960
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,079
information can be expressed in these

961
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:00,640
tags

962
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,839
but that doesn't in any way

963
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,800
affect how you interpret the the part of

964
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,079
the breed so

965
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,160
the instant always comes from there

966
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,440
right uh

967
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,720
and that is then you may ask

968
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,960
why do we need that information well if

969
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,760
you need

970
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,640
to do any sort of arithmetic on the

971
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,319
instant itself then you need this

972
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,760
information right if you want to add a

973
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,640
bunch of

974
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,800
r's to uh to a time stamp you might need

975
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,160
to know the time zone if you

976
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,920
need to add a bunch of months you need

977
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,359
to know which calendar

978
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,560
system the the uh

979
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,078
origin is

980
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,160
uh but yeah it's it's the

981
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,079
timestamp itself always remains in the

982
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,760
gregorian uh

983
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,359
the proleptic gregorian calendar

984
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,240
okay uh

985
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,839
carson

986
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,760
yeah i think part of the confusion here

987
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,880
is that uh there are actually

988
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,800
different applications for date times

989
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,440
and if you all dump them into one big

990
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,839
bucket it's going to become

991
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,599
uh very messy so i think the the ntp

992
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,280
working group is is mostly

993
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,160
interested in something that i call

994
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,880
actual

995
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,079
time so a time that actually can be

996
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,680
mapped

997
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,640
on a time scale for instance the ntp

998
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,160
time scale or

999
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,280
related one uh and uh is

1000
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,599
is not uh subject to to

1001
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,400
let's say non-physical input well okay

1002
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,079
there are leap seconds

1003
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,599
um but in general we can

1004
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,040
treat these times as as actual time

1005
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,200
whether they happened in the past

1006
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,800
or whether they will happen in the

1007
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,319
future but

1008
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,280
but then there is planned time so if i'm

1009
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,720
going to meet

1010
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,160
on christmas eve 2022

1011
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,640
uh at the 4 p.m with someone

1012
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,480
there is no way to map that to a

1013
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
timescale because i don't know whether

1014
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,839
we will have

1015
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,800
a daylight savings time uh next year or

1016
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,319
not

1017
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,480
that is actually changing right now so

1018
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,599
so there is

1019
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,119
no way on earth i can make this return

1020
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,000
disappointment to a timestamp that is

1021
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,240
honest timescale

1022
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,559
and the more you go into these things

1023
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,920
and then you start to to

1024
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,160
discuss recurring events and and all

1025
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,280
this stuff

1026
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,839
the the more complicated this becomes

1027
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,680
and it's no longer about time

1028
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,720
it's more about calendaring and then of

1029
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,640
course there is the third thing

1030
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,520
uh which probably most people here don't

1031
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,720
care about

1032
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,839
which is remembered time which is

1033
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,000
something that happened in the past

1034
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,240
and we only have limited information

1035
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,079
about what time scale that actually was

1036
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:02,960
mapped to

1037
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,160
so let's ignore that for the moment but

1038
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,200
uh for for actual time and for plan time

1039
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,520
you you actually have to have very

1040
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,599
different mechanisms because you

1041
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,319
have to know which part actually wins

1042
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,079
a document that may be useful to look at

1043
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,920
uh in this context so in the sibo

1044
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,640
working group we are looking at a way to

1045
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,559
to represent time that is a little bit

1046
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:33,920
more flexible than the time

1047
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,559
representations we already have

1048
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,599
and i expect some of this to actually go

1049
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,359
into this document at some point

1050
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,000
parts of it are commented out in in the

1051
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,119
current

1052
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,359
submitted internet draft and it could be

1053
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,520
added at any time that that's why i'm

1054
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,319
interested in this subject

1055
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,800
yeah thank you i'd read deeper into the

1056
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,359
document

1057
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,640
your your concerns are really valid uh i

1058
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,440
talked about this briefly yesterday and

1059
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,520
the idea is that the current draft that

1060
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,640
i have

1061
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,079
uh is is not something that works

1062
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,880
well with the idea of plan time so

1063
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,480
that's not a scale

1064
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,800
that this works with right now it's just

1065
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,760
uh just like 339 works with

1066
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,640
instance in time uh this is just in

1067
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,319
addition to that so you can specify

1068
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,680
additional metadata

1069
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,839
that can help you uh you know construct

1070
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,160
uh similar objects or

1071
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,160
information uh from the timestamp

1072
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,040
to to relay as you could say important

1073
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,640
context with the time stamp

1074
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,520
but not uh do things the other way

1075
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,240
around

1076
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,440
i i think there's uh a lot of interest

1077
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,640
in expanding this to actually

1078
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,000
include uh plan time so that's

1079
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,359
that's something uh that

1080
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,400
that probably needs to be answered once

1081
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:00,880
the

1082
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,040
working group regarding this is up and

1083
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,480
running but it'd be

1084
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:13,839
really nice to have your input on that

1085
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,359
all right ira

1086
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,839
um are you still in the queue ira

1087
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:41,839
uh are people still hearing me

1088
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,359
sorry um finger fumble didn't mean to be

1089
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,960
in the queue

1090
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,559
oh okay um but but i

1091
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,319
do think uh it's him would be

1092
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,920
important to um correlate

1093
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,040
this work with uh the work that carsten

1094
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,319
and others have done

1095
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:07,440
on time in sibor work

1096
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,839
all group

1097
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,280
that does make sense oh thank you

1098
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,960
i'd reach out to uh

1099
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,319
i think kirsten uh or other people

1100
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:23,040
mentioned

1101
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,400
in the sea war uh draft

1102
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,200
offline and

1103
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,559
the other thing is i think if you're if

1104
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,000
the working group gets chartered i would

1105
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,839
ask that you uh

1106
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,760
keep this working group informed of it

1107
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,040
just so we

1108
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,640
can follow along

1109
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,160
all right anything else on this draft or

1110
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,599
or on this

1111
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,800
the report from dispatch yesterday uh

1112
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,000
so next up is uh doug arnold he's going

1113
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,960
to talk about some work to extend nts

1114
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,559
for ptp um

1115
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,559
doug did you want me to share screen or

1116
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,359
are you planning to do it

1117
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:12,880
go ahead and share it that seems to be

1118
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,839
more reliable

1119
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,720
just let me get started

1120
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,959
um

1121
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,839
there we go it's this one

1122
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,520
even with them all cued up it seems to

1123
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,200
take me a minute or two to move between

1124
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,400
them um

1125
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,319
yeah all right so there you go

1126
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,040
okay so there's if you've been paying

1127
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,160
attention to the

1128
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,280
email reflector there's been some some

1129
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,000
discussion

1130
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,319
on this topic but what i want to do

1131
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,760
today is just

1132
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,960
sort of put it in perspective and say

1133
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,079
you know what are we trying to do and

1134
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,760
why

1135
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,839
so next slide please

1136
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,599
so there's

1137
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,960
been over the last few years an

1138
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,720
increasing call

1139
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,000
from network operators and people

1140
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,359
making ptp profiles in various

1141
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,440
committees are asking for secure version

1142
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,839
of ptp

1143
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,960
um and in the the the last version that

1144
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,880
published which is the 2019

1145
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,800
edition of 1588 we did have

1146
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,319
a message extension called the

1147
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,839
authentication tlv

1148
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,480
which could be used as a message

1149
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,280
integrity protection

1150
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,760
and we had a little bit of discussion on

1151
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,920
key management but

1152
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,520
but that we didn't really have time to

1153
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,040
finish that

1154
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,240
um so we're taking it up again

1155
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,960
and in the 2019 edition we talked

1156
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,000
specifically about

1157
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,839
tesla and gdoi

1158
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,280
but now we're also including a

1159
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,160
discussion about

1160
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,839
extending nts to cover ptp so next slide

1161
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,839
please

1162
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:32,240
okay so there's there's basically two

1163
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,960
reasons

1164
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,559
two good reasons to have an extend nts

1165
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,000
to cover ptp

1166
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,040
and one is you know time

1167
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,240
server appliances that are

1168
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,799
acta's

1169
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,880
ptp grandmasters are typically also

1170
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,160
ntp servers that's probably the most

1171
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,119
more common than not they're doing both

1172
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,160
and so it

1173
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,520
the implementation would be very

1174
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,680
efficient if you

1175
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,119
had something that was pretty similar

1176
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,440
for both timing protocols

1177
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,880
and the other thing is that i hear from

1178
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,680
network operators is please don't make

1179
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,440
me deploy and maintain another key

1180
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,880
management protocol

1181
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,400
um they you know and they're already

1182
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,319
doing tls everyone's doing tls because

1183
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:20,720
it's

1184
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,359
used for https and other things that are

1185
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,160
common

1186
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,720
and so um that's

1187
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,920
you know another reason to do it

1188
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,200
okay next slide

1189
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,760
so it's you know in summary it's

1190
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,599
efficient for

1191
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,160
product manufacturers and sufficient for

1192
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:42,640
network

1193
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,920
operators okay now there are a lot of

1194
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,480
differences between pdp and ntp

1195
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,599
um that make this

1196
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,720
challenging the first of all is the most

1197
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,040
ptp

1198
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,240
profiles are multicast

1199
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,280
not unicast um

1200
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,400
most of them of the deployments

1201
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,599
have some or all of the switches and

1202
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,640
routers that

1203
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,920
are support the protocol

1204
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,680
and that's a major security challenge

1205
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,960
because now every

1206
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,480
every device in the network is

1207
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,559
participating in this information

1208
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:21,920
transfer

1209
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,040
um their

1210
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,119
pdp deployments are usually in small

1211
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:28,640
private networks

1212
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,880
uh there are some exceptions to that but

1213
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,760
that's the

1214
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,359
by far the most common thing and that's

1215
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:36,720
an advantage um

1216
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,880
often the thinking in it something

1217
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,480
that's behind a firewall the

1218
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,040
security requirements are less than

1219
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,400
something that goes across the public

1220
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,000
internet

1221
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,799
message rates are very high they can be

1222
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,079
128

1223
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,599
sync messages per second and then

1224
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:53,680
there's other ptp messages as well so

1225
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,280
you can have several hundred

1226
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,400
messages per second coming and going

1227
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,960
from the various nodes

1228
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,640
um now unicast ptp is

1229
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,680
i don't know client server mode so it's

1230
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,920
the one that's most like ntp

1231
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,920
um but one difference

1232
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,520
thing that's different is there's uh

1233
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,599
sort of a negotiation protocol

1234
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,000
that sets it up and then then there's

1235
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,359
the ptp time

1236
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,680
transfer aspect of the protocol

1237
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,799
and so they're you know that's kind of a

1238
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:31,040
key difference and also

1239
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,079
ptp grand masters keep state on all

1240
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,599
devices that they're synchronizing

1241
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,040
so it's another difference okay next

1242
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,119
slide

1243
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,880
so those are things just to keep in mind

1244
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,720
if we as we're pursuing this

1245
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,240
um so we have we have a proposal we've

1246
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,680
been putting together in the

1247
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,839
1588 um

1248
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,839
and it's basically looks like this

1249
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:03,760
uh there's a the multicast version

1250
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,720
is uh uses group security group based

1251
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,079
security it's very similar

1252
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,400
to gdoi where there's a key

1253
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,359
a key server and everyone in the group

1254
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,240
sort of checks in and gets the same

1255
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,720
key it's a shared key and then they're

1256
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,880
periodically updated

1257
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,440
um and that's

1258
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,920
you know has it's less secure in some

1259
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,280
ways than

1260
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,520
you know doing one-to-one but it's

1261
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:34,319
practical

1262
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,240
for networks where every node on the

1263
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,839
network

1264
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,920
that's authorized is uh participating

1265
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,240
um and then nts for unicast ptp

1266
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,520
um the approach we had outlined uh

1267
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:55,359
operates more like the ntp version we

1268
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,480
we put the exchange of

1269
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,240
you know the information that goes from

1270
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,599
the ptp

1271
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,640
slave going to the ptp grandmaster

1272
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,160
in what we are calling a ticket

1273
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,640
and put that into the

1274
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,640
unicast negotiation part of the protocol

1275
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,799
and then the time transfer messages

1276
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,960
which can be at these very high rates

1277
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,559
just use the authentication tod

1278
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,079
um and then there's a cyclic

1279
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,119
updates for all participants to

1280
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,280
you know refresh their keys with the nts

1281
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,160
ke server

1282
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,359
next slide please

1283
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,960
okay so this is currently it's being

1284
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,440
discussed in the ieee 1588 security

1285
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,240
subcommittee

1286
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,400
which is also chaired by karen o'donnell

1287
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,079
here that makes it easy to coordinate

1288
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,480
hopefully um but what we'd like to

1289
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,799
do is move it here and make it

1290
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,400
eventually an ietf

1291
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,839
rfc we think that

1292
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:07,359
this is the right place for it there's

1293
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,000
more security expertise

1294
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,599
this working group is familiar with nts

1295
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,559
and if you want to keep nts for ntp and

1296
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,599
nt

1297
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,000
and ptp coordinated this is probably the

1298
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,240
best place to do that

1299
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,839
um so this this is just kind of a

1300
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:26,319
summary

1301
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,680
you know what what we're trying to do

1302
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,559
and why

1303
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,119
and there's going to be proposals um

1304
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:33,920
submitted

1305
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,119
and discussed and debated um

1306
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,760
but this is you know this is what we're

1307
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,440
up to

1308
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,480
so any questions

1309
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,160
uh go ahead daniel so

1310
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,440
it's so um dealing in the

1311
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,480
multicast case here um so you so you're

1312
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,599
talking about a

1313
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,839
group keying protocol that they've sent

1314
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,839
them that that implies that the clients

1315
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,280
have to implicitly trust each other

1316
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,200
because they all share the same keying

1317
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,760
um we're trusting the switches and

1318
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,040
routers to behave

1319
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,319
correctly as part of the protocol um so

1320
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,480
what's left is our threat model here uh

1321
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,520
what what it what is

1322
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,040
what is untrusted that we're protecting

1323
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,759
ourselves against

1324
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,240
well we're we're trusting pretending

1325
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,920
ourselves against someone who gained

1326
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,480
access to the network

1327
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,880
um but don't hasn't necessarily taken

1328
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,760
over

1329
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,240
any device no it's not necessarily a man

1330
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,680
in the middle of attack

1331
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,160
um but they've gained access to the

1332
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,558
network

1333
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,720
and you know ptp is especially

1334
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,160
vulnerable to that because they have

1335
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,160
this best master clock algorithm where

1336
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,079
there is one best master

1337
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,520
and it's based on self-proclaimed

1338
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,480
credentials um and so if someone just

1339
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,480
gets access to the network they can take

1340
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,760
it over

1341
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,240
uh so are are we are we permissioning

1342
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,920
clients uh what what what parents the

1343
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,680
adversary from from just joining the

1344
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,039
group and getting access to that group

1345
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,839
heating material

1346
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,200
yeah i mean there things that are

1347
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,720
open-ended are you know

1348
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,599
you can run an authorization protocol as

1349
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,280
well so if someone tries to check in and

1350
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,599
say i want a key for this group and

1351
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,359
the key server can refuse

1352
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,680
um

1353
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,720
and then you don't have the the right

1354
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,319
key so then you can't make the right

1355
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,280
checksums and

1356
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,839
you know

1357
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,919
that's the threat model

1358
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,039
and you know this sort of thing has been

1359
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,039
used in real networks it's used in the

1360
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,480
power grid

1361
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,839
gdoi specifically has been used in the

1362
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,760
power grid

1363
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,039
to secure some of the scada system

1364
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:03,839
messages like goose messages

1365
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,359
i mean i'm not so i'm uh um i'm i'm not

1366
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,079
i'm not

1367
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:10,480
challenging the suggestion that this if

1368
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,559
this is specified it'll get used like

1369
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,799
my my question is more on the lines of

1370
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,880
is it being used for actual security or

1371
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,079
is more of or is it

1372
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:19,520
are we just creating a compliance

1373
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,319
talisman for people

1374
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,160
well you know what oh so go ahead doug

1375
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,399
sorry

1376
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,839
a compliance talisman

1377
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,000
well you know there's definitely a call

1378
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,799
for security

1379
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:46,240
people want to secure ptp um and

1380
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,000
we've had a lot of discussion on what do

1381
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,160
we what do we do with a network

1382
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,079
that is every switch is a transparent

1383
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,480
clock and um

1384
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,240
they're all altering the messages as

1385
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,000
they go through what

1386
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,880
you know are we gonna have a lot of

1387
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,200
secrets

1388
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,280
or are we gonna have one secret that is

1389
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,640
shared among authorized

1390
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,760
users it's you know neither one is

1391
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,319
perfect but it's it's a

1392
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,680
you know it's a kind of a worst case

1393
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,359
scenario in terms of trying to

1394
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,400
secure a protocol because

1395
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,920
it's it's not you know a conversation

1396
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,920
between two nodes that is just being

1397
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,160
moved through switches they're

1398
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,160
every every device is part of the

1399
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,559
conversation

1400
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,079
yeah i mean and i guess my position on

1401
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:41,920
this is the same as it's been for years

1402
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:42,640
uh that

1403
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,039
that um you're absolutely right it is it

1404
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,960
is it is a worst case scenario and i

1405
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,280
think

1406
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,920
i think i think um what that forces is

1407
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,559
just a fun

1408
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:54,079
is a fundamental trade-off um if you if

1409
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,280
you trust everything and everything is

1410
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,559
behaving correctly then you can get a

1411
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,039
lot of

1412
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,319
you can get a lot of precision benefit

1413
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:00,240
out of ptp um

1414
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,480
but if things are behaving incorrectly

1415
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,680
then you either then

1416
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:06,480
you then what you're ultimately going to

1417
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,079
get is something that basically falls

1418
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:09,359
back to

1419
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:12,640
to the pounds you get out of ntp

1420
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:15,200
and and no amount of crypto is going to

1421
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:22,720
save you from that trade-off

1422
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,680
um i i i don't think i completely agree

1423
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:27,520
with it i think there are attack

1424
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,119
attack modes that a group key could help

1425
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:31,760
with

1426
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,880
um and and the one i mentioned is

1427
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,480
because of this you know ntp

1428
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,599
has you can talk to you can ask

1429
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,520
lots of servers for time and you can run

1430
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,680
a voting algorithm and you can detect

1431
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:49,039
that you know one of them has a problem

1432
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,680
in in ptp that's that's allowed but not

1433
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,720
generally not done and so they are

1434
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,640
vulnerable to that you know a device

1435
01:05:58,640 --> 01:05:59,119
just

1436
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,359
getting into the network even if they

1437
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:02,799
haven't taken over any

1438
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,480
switch if they've taken over a switch

1439
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,079
they can do all kinds of things

1440
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,400
and maybe messing with the time isn't

1441
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,760
even the worst one but

1442
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,440
if they just get access to the network

1443
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,240
maybe they can't get the group key

1444
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,839
because they're not authorized

1445
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,960
and that would be something that would

1446
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:23,359
be

1447
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:26,480
better than doing nothing and then

1448
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,359
there's the

1449
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,640
the unicast case where

1450
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,480
if you have unicast um

1451
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:39,920
then it can be more like uh nts for ntp

1452
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,079
um and there are a lot of networks where

1453
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,640
you have unicast and you don't have

1454
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,960
on-pass support so it's more of an

1455
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,960
end-to-end uh

1456
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,000
point-to-point conversation and it can

1457
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,760
can be more highly secured

1458
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,359
yeah i i i i mean that i think

1459
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,960
the more it's shaped like ntp client

1460
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,079
server mode the

1461
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,319
the the easier it becomes to secure it

1462
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:10,079
with something nts shaped

1463
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,200
um but i'm not sure there's any point on

1464
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,319
that spectrum where

1465
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:17,520
just use nt where we're either

1466
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,359
continue using unsecured ptp or

1467
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:24,400
you or use nts secured ntp i'm just

1468
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,760
i'm just not convinced there's any

1469
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,839
useful middle ground there

1470
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,280
alright dennis

1471
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:43,920
uh dennis did you want to

1472
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,319
how are you muted right now yes

1473
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:51,440
okay sorry about that um i did also want

1474
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,480
to point out

1475
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,039
um that i think there is some

1476
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,520
agreement that when it comes to securing

1477
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,280
time networks

1478
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,480
um that the time itself is not

1479
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,520
necessarily what we're securing because

1480
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:07,920
the

1481
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:10,319
the time is a fact the moment and that

1482
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:12,400
it's really associations we're securing

1483
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,520
and so in this case the focus is going

1484
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:16,080
to be

1485
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,600
on on a secure ptp network

1486
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,839
making sure that no ptp

1487
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:27,359
clients attach to unauthorized masters

1488
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,198
if if an attacker gains control of the

1489
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,238
network and

1490
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:35,359
simply participates on the network as a

1491
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,839
timing client that's they're not doing

1492
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:39,040
that much damage

1493
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,799
it's really protecting that association

1494
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,640
between all the clients on the network

1495
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,640
and whatever is serving the time

1496
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,359
um that i think is going to be the focus

1497
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:47,839
of

1498
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,600
of whatever security comes out of the

1499
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,120
ptp group

1500
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,399
because as as doug observes the the ptp

1501
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,560
best master clock algorithm was not

1502
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,560
designed with security in mind and

1503
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,399
um it it can be easy for a rogue

1504
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:06,080
attacker to simply broadcast

1505
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,679
better bmca credentials and

1506
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,920
now all of a sudden all of the multicast

1507
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,520
ptp elements are

1508
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,560
taking time from it

1509
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,520
so i think what's being secured here is

1510
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,120
that time association

1511
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,559
with whatever is providing the time

1512
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:34,799
okay uh next in the queue uh

1513
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,198
kristoff oh wait doug did you have

1514
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,359
anything you wanted to say or

1515
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,679
no i i completely agree with dennis's

1516
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:44,000
comments

1517
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,839
kristoff

1518
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,158
is this working properly now the audio

1519
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:56,640
yes yes we can

1520
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,920
great um i was just going to add that

1521
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:02,960
i don't think we should see um ptp

1522
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,159
use cases as set in stone um at this

1523
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:08,480
point

1524
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,320
we see popping up more and more that

1525
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,320
people want to use pdp over like

1526
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,280
long land lines or in scenarios that

1527
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,640
hasn't been used before

1528
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,840
um so maybe also just the

1529
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,520
generic aspect of future proofing

1530
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,760
would be smart to think about here um

1531
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,239
instead of

1532
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,320
seeing it as a given that pdp is always

1533
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:32,320
used in like completely controlled

1534
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,280
networks um

1535
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,199
as it is as it largely is now

1536
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,440
yeah i think i think that's a good point

1537
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,800
and i think that's part of the reason we

1538
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,800
are proposing these two different modes

1539
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,880
you know one one for this kind of

1540
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,280
small little private network and one and

1541
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:54,880
the

1542
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,520
the unicast version that they can

1543
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,760
you know serve some of the applications

1544
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:12,800
in the category you just stated

1545
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,239
okay um

1546
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:19,840
any other questions on this draft um

1547
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,080
so doug was uh

1548
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,920
the primary developer of this is martin

1549
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,000
he was unable to be here today

1550
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,760
so thank you doug i think we sort of

1551
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,239
asked you at the last minute to do this

1552
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,600
um and uh

1553
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,560
there is a zero zero draft that has been

1554
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,080
posted

1555
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,679
and there's an update coming right doug

1556
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,520
oh yeah there'll be there'll be updates

1557
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,520
and there's already a counter proposal

1558
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,360
from some of the details

1559
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,880
um so yeah we'll be discussing this

1560
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,880
all right um

1561
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,679
all righty any other questions on this

1562
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:03,840
topic

1563
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,600
so um with that the next one on the

1564
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:08,320
agenda

1565
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,360
is the next topic on the agenda are

1566
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,159
the ntp v5 drafts or the ntp v5

1567
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,280
discussion

1568
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,640
um the way we thought we would organize

1569
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,120
this

1570
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,640
is james has uh done a requirements

1571
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,920
document so you would be

1572
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,880
first james

1573
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,000
uh let's see

1574
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,640
do you want uh do you want me to do your

1575
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,159
slides or

1576
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,600
yeah that's probably more reliable

1577
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,199
i'm not entirely sure of that but

1578
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,050
let's see

1579
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:47,120
[Music]

1580
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,840
application window

1581
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,360
all right excellent uh okay

1582
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,480
so uh next slide please

1583
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,600
so uh a bit of a brief overview of what

1584
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,440
this is so i

1585
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,239
last itf i think it was karen um a few

1586
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:07,440
others discussed

1587
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,840
the idea of having a requirements

1588
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,800
document to at least collate

1589
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,520
the various things that people were

1590
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,320
interested

1591
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,360
in uh fixing with regards to well

1592
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,480
in terms of the design of ntb v5 i know

1593
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,600
that there is

1594
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,400
a lot of a lot of people got a lot of

1595
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,080
different ideas

1596
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,600
so i set forth and went through track

1597
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,440
and i went through

1598
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,040
as many different things that i could

1599
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,360
find that have

1600
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,120
uh they're covering the various issues

1601
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,880
with ntbv4 and

1602
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,199
as well as some of my own thoughts uh

1603
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,320
about this

1604
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,400
um about what what ntb5 ntp v5 could and

1605
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,520
couldn't have

1606
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,760
um and so the whole point of this is to

1607
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,120
to start that discussion

1608
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,280
and and get some consensus on some of

1609
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:56,239
the difficult

1610
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,880
uh points i know that we've been since

1611
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,159
the last interim

1612
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,960
had quite some robust discussion on

1613
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:03,520
points

1614
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,960
around security and time scales and so

1615
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,080
on

1616
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,440
uh next slide please

1617
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,080
um so i've got currently got

1618
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:17,280
two versions of the draft out so i've

1619
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,280
got oh one out at the moment i've got

1620
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,239
a few editorial changes sitting in the

1621
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:23,440
github repo

1622
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,360
uh just just a recap of what's in the

1623
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,360
document if you've not read it

1624
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,679
it puts in requirements for a new linear

1625
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:30,800
time scale so

1626
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:34,960
no leap seconds uh in in band

1627
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,760
it supports or at least aims to support

1628
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,159
both

1629
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:41,520
utc and tai representations

1630
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:43,360
and leaves room in extensions to

1631
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,560
potentially support

1632
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,640
other time scales um

1633
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,560
i think the the least controversial

1634
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,679
thing that

1635
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,480
is there is uh separation of of steering

1636
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,159
algorithms away from the protocol

1637
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,840
specification

1638
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,320
um authentication as a requirement with

1639
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,040
oxygen

1640
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:04,159
with optional confidentiality um as well

1641
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:04,880
as some

1642
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,159
some statements about backwards

1643
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:08,159
compatibility uh

1644
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,000
taking into consideration uh

1645
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,280
ossification which

1646
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:12,880
uh i think it was a yuki who brought up

1647
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,360
on the list not too long ago

1648
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,760
um as well as some extensibility and

1649
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,679
there's a there's a few other

1650
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,199
next slide please there's there's quite

1651
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:24,560
a few things that have not yet been

1652
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,360
covered

1653
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,520
uh but some of these are issues in the

1654
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,640
github repo

1655
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,560
uh some of these are just on my to-do

1656
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,120
list these things include

1657
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,360
uh what might be put in requirements to

1658
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,640
deal with ddos

1659
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,679
and that as well as putting together

1660
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,960
a threat model to at least describe

1661
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,239
the kinds of things that uh

1662
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:50,080
we will deal with or or won't deal with

1663
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,920
which i think will be a critical part of

1664
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,400
dealing with the security

1665
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,440
aspect of the protocol design uh last

1666
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,239
slide

1667
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:01,760
please um so i

1668
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,000
i am asked kind of ask opening this up

1669
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,560
to a discussion about um

1670
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,040
next slide please karen um

1671
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,520
the so i would like to open this up

1672
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,040
should we be considering adopting this

1673
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,800
document um

1674
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,840
and what sort of uh process should we be

1675
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,960
using to apply

1676
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:26,000
to the protocol design

1677
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,400
um i would like to just leave that open

1678
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,080
to people and i'd like to hear what

1679

1686
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,520
i just wanted to mention that uh some

1687
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,480
work was done

1688
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,040
on a similar topic at the beginning of

1689
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,000
tiktak

1690
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,560
quite a few years ago but uh kurt and

1691
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,199
peter

1692
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,440
uh came up with a document which they

1693
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,440
called itp which was

1694
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,360
supposed to be the next version of ntp

1695
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,880
and it's worthwhile to see if there's

1696
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,679
anything

1697
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,600
in that document that might be of use

1698
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,159
i was unaware of that um okay i will put

1699
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:23,040
that on my things to read list

1700
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,880
yeah when um when the tick tock working

1701
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,960
group first started um

1702
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,120
and uh stuart and yakov were chairing it

1703
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,679
the um

1704
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:38,400
uh charter was actually to do a

1705
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:44,320
a requirements analysis and a um uh

1706
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,960
gap analysis between ntp and ptp to see

1707
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,480
what the next generation of

1708
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,520
of time synchronization protocol

1709
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,640
should look like so there is some it was

1710
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,840
a more open-ended

1711
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,600
um what's the next thing

1712
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,800
okay but there is a there is a document

1713
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,719
with requirements um

1714
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:07,040
yeah i can find it i remember they

1715
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,320
called it itp

1716
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:11,360
in order not to call it mtp

1717
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,040
yeah they there was that document that

1718
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,560
was there another requirements

1719
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,199
like the an actual requirements document

1720
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:18,320
that

1721
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,000
like the the beginnings of the gap

1722
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,760
analysis but anyway

1723
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,920
really old tic-tock documents we we

1724
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,920
actually had an interim which we went

1725
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,600
and we put together a gap

1726
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,480
document i do not recall if it came out

1727
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,000
as a draft

1728
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,040
but i probably could find it if i look

1729
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,960
around

1730
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,840
yeah if you could that would be greatly

1731
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,840
appreciated

1732
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,040
um doug

1733
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,800
oh sorry god i'm muted there okay um

1734
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,239
yeah i i would say i think it would be

1735
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:59,199
very helpful in the development of ntp

1736
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,960
version five

1737
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,880
to have this document go forward

1738
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,960
um there's there's you know lots of

1739
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,000
ideas being debated

1740
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,880
lots of passion and if we can agree on

1741
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,400
the requirements

1742
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,280
then i think we can help sort of rein in

1743
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,480
the discussion and say

1744
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,040
let's go forward in that direction and

1745
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:20,840
we have a much better chance of

1746
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,840
converging

1747
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,520
all right um daniel

1748
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,480
yeah um so i think so i think something

1749
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,159
of this shape should go forward

1750
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,440
in some form um i'm not sure

1751
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,679
whether we really need to advance it as

1752
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:42,960
an internet draft though

1753
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,920
um it's just um and i know this is

1754
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,040
something that happens all the time in

1755
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,800
the itf but it's something that i

1756
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,719
grumble about every time i get a second

1757
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,080
review of one of these

1758
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,600
um that i don't see that this is going

1759
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,480
to

1760
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,520
have any archival value

1761
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,560
once we have an actual

1762
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,239
an actual working group specification

1763
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:05,600
document advanta it

1764
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,639
adopted um so maybe this is something

1765
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:09,840
that we should that

1766
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,320
um that should just go into the wiki

1767
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:13,840
we've started and maintain it in that

1768
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,840
form rather than have it as a

1769
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,880
formal working group document so

1770
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,159
i um i i

1771
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,679
i hear what you're saying i guess the

1772
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,440
thing that that

1773
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,800
i'm wondering about is we've just had

1774
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,880
the counter example to that where

1775
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,639
a draft that was done 13 years ago we

1776
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:33,920
have just said wow it would be really

1777
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,679
good to take another look at that

1778
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:47,840
so i think there is archival value

1779
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:54,239
um uh yakov

1780
01:20:54,239 --> 01:20:56,719
yes um i saw one point is i'm getting

1781
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:57,679
into technical things

1782
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,480
maybe this should be brought to a list

1783
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,400
but there was a point there about

1784
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,960
separating the steering from the

1785
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,199
protocol i remember one of the

1786
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,840
topics that we discussed at the time was

1787
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:12,320
the fact that ntp unlike ptp

1788
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,320
has a lot of these uh dispersion

1789
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,000
parameters and things of that sort

1790
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,280
in the packet because of its uh

1791
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,520
client server rather than master slave

1792
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,120
uh architecture

1793
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,600
uh and that would be something we didn't

1794
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,199
actually get into it too much at the

1795
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,440
time but everyone realized that was a

1796
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,040
part of the problem it would be

1797
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,360
interesting if you could have

1798
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,639
a separation that is have a document

1799
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,600
excuse me i have a protocol which does

1800
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,960
not

1801
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,320
uh go hand in hand with the

1802
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,080
algorithm which is used for the

1803
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,440
stabilization of your

1804
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,520
of your clock even when it is uh

1805
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,120
rest full that is uh cure client server

1806
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:58,480
when the server forgets the client

1807
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,080
okay

1808
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,520
that does seem like something that we

1809
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,040
should discuss on the list

1810
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,840
um james did you have anything you want

1811
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,159
to say specific to that

1812
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:20,159
no nothing specific that makes that that

1813
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:21,199
makes sense that's

1814
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,480
certainly a discussion we can have on

1815
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,320
the list okay

1816
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,400
uh daniel are you still in the queue or

1817
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,920
is that a

1818
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,719
q fragment and you're out of the queue

1819
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,960
sorry

1820
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,880
um all right so the next thing is uh

1821
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,440
and we don't have slides for this uh so

1822
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,120
marislav has

1823
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,800
uh put together a draft proposal for

1824
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:47,440
ntpv5 marislav did you wish to speak to

1825
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,400
that

1826
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,360
or would you please speak to that yeah

1827
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,839
sure

1828
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,120
there is a new version of the draft that

1829
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,719
i uploaded

1830
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,679
the concept hasn't changed it still

1831
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,040
looks

1832
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,360
mostly like dntp that everyone knows

1833
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,400
it's trying to address the issues

1834
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,239
that we have described and that i

1835
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:13,440
thought

1836
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,159
we were set on addressing but

1837
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:20,320
from the discussions with that it

1838
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,000
doesn't seem so

1839
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,480
so in this version of the draft

1840
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,120
there are no changes in the protocol

1841
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:32,239
there are some general improvements

1842
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,960
there is a full description of the

1843
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,199
correction field now

1844
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:41,520
uh doc doug helped me with this

1845
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,199
there is a new section on the

1846
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:44,719
measurement modes

1847
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,800
there is still a lot of things missing

1848
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,639
to make a full description of the

1849
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,320
protocol and

1850
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,280
before trying to finish this i think we

1851
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,800
need those

1852
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,400
requirements from discussions

1853
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,159
we had on the mailing list i think it's

1854
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,320
clear that some people want

1855
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,850
something very different and

1856
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:08,159
[Music]

1857
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:17,839
we need to agree on what that should be

1858
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:21,519
okay um

1859
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,320
are there any questions or

1860
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:25,760
clarifications

1861
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,960
for miroslav and what is in his current

1862
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,840
draft

1863
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:43,360
okay so

1864
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,440
thank you very much marislav i mean we

1865
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,440
did ask

1866
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,560
one of the keys for the ietf is that we

1867
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,040
need contributions to drive our work

1868
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,400
um and so i'm really interested in

1869
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,000
in what uh you know implementers are

1870
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,080
interested in implementing and also what

1871
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,239
um

1872
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,880
vendors are willing to put into products

1873
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,239
and so

1874
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:12,560
um go ahead yakov

1875
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,679
just a short comment um i'm trying to

1876
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:16,320
read the

1877
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,520
the uh draft right now um

1878
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,840
once again my apologies for not coming

1879
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,520
uh having read all the drafts i can't

1880
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:24,960
sit on one of the

1881
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,639
front two rows uh of miteko here

1882
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:31,840
however it it it

1883
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,719
looks very nice yes there are some gaps

1884
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:35,440
in it

1885
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,320
and it is definitely a a small increment

1886
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,159
as compared to ntp but it looks like

1887
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:40,719
it's a

1888
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:44,800
uh a good solid version

1889
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,080
okay uh doug

1890
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,960
yeah i you know some of the the other

1891
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,960
things that people want to do with

1892
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,480
ntp i think i think a real virtue of

1893
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,880
what miroslav has started with is

1894
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:06,159
uh something that's very flexible

1895
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:09,360
so it can do all the traditional ntp

1896
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,600
you can get time over the public

1897
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:12,719
internet

1898
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,760
from a pool but you can also do

1899
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,159
some kind of niche application in some

1900
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:20,880
cyber physical system that people now

1901
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,000
are already doing with ntp packets but

1902
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,480
not

1903
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:29,599
the rest of ntp and so i think it it

1904
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:32,560
it's got the best of both worlds it's

1905
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,400
got the flexibility to do

1906
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,520
all the different things that people

1907
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,560
want to do with ntp

1908
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,239
okay

1909
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,639
any other questions or comments

1910
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:53,920
uh watson go ahead

1911
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,560
uh speaking as an implementer uh yeah

1912
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,440
there's not

1913
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,440
i don't know that much about the the

1914
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:01,920
details of the pll but so whatever comes

1915
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:04,080
out of this process whatever

1916
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,639
you know it's not really uh going to

1917
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,560
push one way or the other unless there's

1918
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,120
thing you know

1919
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,320
look at the straps look at the other

1920
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,560
proposals they both look the same to me

1921
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,400
um one thing did you say anything about

1922
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,360
the pll stability discussion or this

1923
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,000
long

1924
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,800
long thread on the mailing list about

1925
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,560
this particular thing and whether or not

1926
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:26,080
you need to transfer frequency

1927
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:33,840
separately and the impact there

1928
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,760
i'm sorry i didn't get the question like

1929
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,679
if this should be included in the draft

1930
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,920
this discussion

1931
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,080
yeah there was this discussion about the

1932
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,760
impact on stability of

1933
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,920
do you need the frequency or is it a

1934
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:58,880
consequence

1935
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,520
of or does that only help if your pll is

1936
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,159
otherwise

1937
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:05,760
mistuned to uh track more aggressively

1938
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,320
than it should

1939
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,860
um yeah i think

1940
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:13,360
[Music]

1941
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,840
i think it is it does help but it

1942
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,280
doesn't help always

1943
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:21,760
so it depends on the pll

1944
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,400
but if you want to minimize both time

1945
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,639
and frequency error

1946
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,000
and you don't have enough data like the

1947
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,639
polling rate is not sufficient

1948
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,920
you need to transfer both time and

1949
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,280
frequency separately

1950
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:44,159
yeah but i don't think this should be um

1951
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,239
discussed in the draft of the protocol i

1952
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,760
think the protocol should just be

1953
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,840
exchanging times time that's all

1954
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:56,400
it is needed and it's up to the

1955
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,760
implementation to

1956
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,120
decide how the clock should be

1957
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,719
controlled

1958
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:06,880
and what um

1959
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,320
what is the goal to minimize

1960
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,360
both time and frequency error or just

1961
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:15,760
one of them

1962
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,199
i think in the ntp v4 specification

1963
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:24,400
there is this pll fll

1964
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:29,120
algorithm that works

1965
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,320
but it's not

1966
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:35,360
always it doesn't always

1967
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:38,880
meet those requirements so

1968
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,639
it's clear that people need

1969
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:46,320
something else in some cases so

1970
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:53,840
the specification shouldn't prevent that

1971
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,000
okay um daniel

1972
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,199
um so before we go forward with adopting

1973
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,840
any draft specification um i think

1974
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:10,320
there's

1975
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,560
one really contentious issue that last

1976
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,239
that last i looked seems to be uh

1977
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,600
splitting this working group about

1978
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,040
cleanly in half

1979
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:20,800
um which is whether or not um ntv5

1980
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,600
should support

1981
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,239
any any unauthenticated mode of

1982
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:25,600
operation

1983
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,239
um and i think i think we should i think

1984
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:29,840
we should probably

1985
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,719
get a formal consensus call on that

1986
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:33,440
issue

1987
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:35,280
um before we before we do much of

1988
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,639
anything else because that's going to be

1989
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:37,600
a real blocker

1990
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,800
in in determining some pretty basic

1991
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,840
things about the

1992
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,960
structure of the wire format

1993
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,560
yeah i think that was part of the um

1994
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,719
marislav saying that we needed to

1995
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,320
advance their requirements a little bit

1996
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,800
before we adopted a draft

1997
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,880
so i think that'll happen as part of

1998
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,840
that um

1999
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:03,120
yaka

2000
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,800
go ahead yakov can i go ahead okay um

2001
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,560
my comment is actually about the

2002
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,040
previous discussion the requirements one

2003
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,639
but it was triggered

2004
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,920
by the discussion of the pll i think in

2005
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:16,480
any

2006
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:19,120
requirements document for a new version

2007
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,880
especially one that's going to be

2008
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,679
doing other kinds of use cases the

2009
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:24,480
discussion

2010
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,520
of what you do or how you can exploit

2011
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,679
the fact you might get frequency

2012
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,159
from some other source and not from the

2013
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,199
time itself

2014
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:36,400
such as which is being done in uh

2015
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:39,120
telecom networks uh where you use sync

2016
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,520
eve to get frequency and then 1588

2017
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,920
only for the time um i think that's a

2018
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,600
discussion which is worth

2019
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,280
capturing in a requirements document

2020
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:59,760
okay uh james

2021
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,520
one of the points that i failed to

2022
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,440
mention when i was presenting earlier

2023
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,880
because i turned into a ball

2024
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,080
of nerves was the the requirements

2025
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,760
that that i have in this document are

2026
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,199
not set in stone

2027
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,600
they're just my collection of things and

2028
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:15,840
so if the working group

2029
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,920
wants to reconcile have a different view

2030
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,560
as to daniel's point around security

2031
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,760
requirements or whatnot and there is

2032
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:28,880
then that's completely fine so the call

2033
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,239
for

2034
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,840
the call for adoption and requirements

2035
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,920
document is not necessarily a call for

2036
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,639
adoption

2037
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:38,800
on security um it's

2038
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,560
called adoption for a document that

2039
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,440
specifies the requirements of v5

2040
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,199
and and we can decide either before or

2041
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:48,960
after whether or not we want to actually

2042
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:55,840
have that requirement

2043
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,440
yeah i was thinking of the call for

2044
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,638
adoption on marislav's ntp v5 document

2045
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,199
i think the answer to the security

2046
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:11,199
question might need to be

2047
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:14,879
addressed in the requirements document

2048
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,239
um uh

2049
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:25,920
sorry carsten 2 target yeah thank you

2050
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,480
um i have a simple point of information

2051
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:29,920
i just leave through the

2052
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,600
the document and uh it mentions

2053
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,159
leap smearing and i'm wondering is is

2054
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,000
there something like a conversion a

2055
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:38,880
convergence

2056
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,600
on on the right way to do leap smearing

2057
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,679
already

2058
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:51,199
just a question

2059
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:54,159
i don't feel there's a convergence so um

2060
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:54,880
i i mean i

2061
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,000
so so i i i think the answer to that

2062
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,360
is sort of um the

2063
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,719
uh uh what google calls their standard

2064
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:07,520
smear of 24 hours noon to noon

2065
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:11,199
uh linear smear um seems to be trying to

2066
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:12,560
assert itself as something like a

2067
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,679
convergence

2068
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,360
um i think and i i think if the if

2069
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,719
the i think this working

2070
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:24,080
so i mean i think this working group

2071
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,480
is probably probably has more power than

2072
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,280
anybody else

2073
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,199
to make to turn to turn that into an

2074
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:30,400
actual convergence

2075
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,000
uh but that does feel like the direction

2076
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,719
things are heading right now

2077
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:36,960
was that something that people actively

2078
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:38,800
pursue or

2079
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,159
is it just in people's minds

2080
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,480
it's i mean it's in my mind other people

2081
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,440
can speak for theirs

2082
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,360
james

2083
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,119
i'm i'm desperate to get rid of leap

2084
01:35:01,119 --> 01:35:02,000
seconds

2085
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,159
um for all the paints of course or at

2086
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,000
least putting them in

2087
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,600
separately from from the time

2088
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,440
information so they can be handled

2089
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,639
separately

2090
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:17,119
i uh

2091
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,280
i feel like i have scars from leap

2092
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,159
second discussions

2093
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,440
that's why i was asking the the the

2094
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,239
document just

2095
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,080
mentioned them as if they were done

2096
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,480
dealed and i just wanted to know

2097
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,600
whether i have missed something because

2098
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,440
i haven't been to an ntp meeting like in

2099
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:42,239
10 years or something

2100
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:45,360
okay that answers my question so with

2101
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,159
that let me just make my my uh

2102
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:51,920
uh saturn sensio here uh of course any

2103
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,199
new protocol

2104
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,600
that has extensibility you should use

2105
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,600
sibo for the extensibility

2106
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,560
but i'll shut up now

2107
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,239
doug

2108
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:12,800
so enough uh people who work for large

2109
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,480
companies that have large distributive

2110
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,400
databases have told me they want to do

2111
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,480
leap smearing that i've

2112
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:20,159
given up on talking them out of it i

2113
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:22,960
think it's just going to happen

2114
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,119
whether it's a good idea or not i i

2115
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,040
think the justification for it is that

2116
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,080
it's easier

2117
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:31,360
to mess up the time than it is to get

2118
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,080
all the database code to do handle leap

2119
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:34,960
seconds

2120
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:39,840
correctly um

2121
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,080
yeah i mean i i i so i don't think

2122
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,080
there's there's

2123
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,639
that much controversy about about that

2124
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:47,679
part um

2125
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:50,159
there's other um there are always going

2126
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:51,840
to be applications that want to be able

2127
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,440
just assume that there's 60 seconds in a

2128
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:54,080
minute

2129
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,440
and and and takes smeared time um but i

2130
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,000
think

2131
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,320
what this working group needs to address

2132
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:01,520
is

2133
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,280
whether is is what ntp should be

2134
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,480
carrying on the wire

2135
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,480
versus what is just a translation

2136
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:09,760
performed by the

2137
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,360
ntp client for the view of the rest of

2138
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:14,159
the operating system

2139
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,440
yeah well i i think that what's in

2140
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,199
mirasoft's draft is he

2141
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:22,159
is making smearing visible so you can

2142
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:22,639
see

2143
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:24,560
yes it's turned on there's a flag for

2144
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,000
that um

2145
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,199
and and as well as some

2146
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:32,239
additional information so i think that's

2147
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:36,320
should be part of ndp version product

2148
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,440
my view on that is that um is that the

2149
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:46,880
npp packets should

2150
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,400
should carry all the information

2151
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,080
necessary in order for the client to

2152
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,760
perform a leap smear

2153
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:53,119
but we should not actually be putting

2154
01:37:53,119 --> 01:38:03,839
smeared timestamps on the wire

2155
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,639
just wanted to agree with that statement

2156
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,560
that not put the smeared

2157
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:16,960
timestamps on the wire um

2158
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,600
all right so enough about leap seconds

2159
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,840
um

2160
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:31,839
uh harlan

2161
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,800
um did you mean to raise your hand or

2162
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:35,679
can you

2163
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,760
join the key can you turn on your audio

2164
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:43,440
sorry about that

2165
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:47,199
yeah figuring out icons is always fun

2166
01:38:47,199 --> 01:38:50,159
uh expecting clients to be able to

2167
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,679
handle leap smearing is

2168
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,960
naive so there are certainly that

2169
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,760
completely valid use cases for for

2170
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,920
putting smeared time out in an ntp time

2171
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,239
stamp

2172
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,679
uh go ahead and there are really really

2173
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:10,560
good

2174
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,400
applications where it's a terrible thing

2175
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,719
to do

2176
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:22,800
go ahead harlan you're still speaking

2177
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,600
that may be

2178
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:25,360
but what we're now talking about is

2179
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,360
policy and

2180
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,840
whether or not it's a bad idea is

2181
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,360
something which is decided as local

2182
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,320
policy

2183
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,639
the ability to do something about

2184
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:36,639
possible smeared time is a mechanism

2185
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:41,840
question and that goes to the protocol

2186
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:00,400
okay oh watson go ahead

2187
01:40:01,119 --> 01:40:02,880
take too much time with smart but i

2188
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,400
think you

2189
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,119
the clients can you know the client

2190
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:08,960
implementation can compute the smear and

2191
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:10,719
adjust the clock locally it's more of a

2192
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,040
problem for servers

2193
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:15,679
where we have if you start changing the

2194
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:16,719
system clock

2195
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,159
and you're depending on packet

2196
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:19,920
timestamps this whole huge

2197
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,440
mess um so it's you know and

2198
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,880
that's probably not really a working

2199
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,480
group thing so much as a

2200
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,800
people implementing this working with

2201
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,400
operating systems to try and get the

2202
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,040
interfaces we need to implement

2203
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:35,760
smear time and ntp v5 on the same

2204
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,119
systems if that's something that people

2205
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:37,520
end up

2206
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,760
doing

2207
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,199
so what harlan what you were saying is

2208
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:51,119
something that you would want to do

2209
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,960
to legacy v4 clients

2210
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:57,040
right it's not really a consideration

2211
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,239
that would go

2212
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:01,440
into the design of v5

2213
01:41:01,440 --> 01:41:03,040
i'm not sure i understand your question

2214
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:04,480
carson

2215
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,239
well you just said there's a use case

2216
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,560
for leading clients through

2217
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,080
leap smearing event

2218
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:15,040
and i'm saying that there is a big class

2219
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,239
of clients

2220
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:19,280
that will not be able to decide whether

2221
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:19,840
or not

2222
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,880
they wish to smear leap second time

2223
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,440
and therefore there is a significant use

2224
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:25,920
case

2225
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:29,040
where clients must be told to use leap

2226
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,880
smeared time so they stay in sync with

2227
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,159
other devices

2228
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,879
in the network

2229
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:37,520
so the decision as to whether or not you

2230
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,760
put you you feed smeared time to

2231
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,880
somebody

2232
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:44,080
is a local policy choice

2233
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,119
and in and there are

2234
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:52,159
trivial ways to make sure that uh

2235
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,199
there are trivial ways to make sure that

2236
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,880
the time

2237
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,239
you resp you give somebody

2238
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:02,639
could be smeared or not based on what

2239
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,440
they're telling you

2240
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,600
so this this doesn't have to be

2241
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,199
complicated and

2242
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:11,360
from everything i've seen over the last

2243
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,320
several years of

2244
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,560
of coming up with proposals around this

2245
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,760
it's not that big of a deal

2246
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,080
okay

2247
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,880
okay um

2248
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,639
where am i in the queue daniel um

2249
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:38,080
so uh uh harlan

2250
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:41,199
this configuration of clients thing

2251
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:42,880
telling them telling them what kind of

2252
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,320
time the system should use that's

2253
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,000
that that's that sounds like something

2254
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,360
to put into

2255
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:51,360
dhcp not directly into ndp

2256
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,719
that is certainly a choice but again

2257
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,480
that's going to require

2258
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,800
clients running updated software and

2259
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,080
that's something that we

2260
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,760
that if somebody decides is a really

2261
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,440
good idea and it really is

2262
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:05,679
well then in 30 years we'll know if they

2263
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:06,480
were right

2264
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,679
yeah i mean i mean of i mean of of of

2265
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:10,159
course

2266
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,000
we need them running updated software

2267
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,119
otherwise they're still going to be on

2268
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,199
mtv4

2269
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,639
anything and anything implementing

2270
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:19,600
integrity 5 obviously has to be updated

2271
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,480
well yes but an ntb pv5 server is going

2272
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,080
to be talking to ntp v4

2273
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,520
clients for decades it'll be

2274
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:29,119
it of course it'll be speaking into

2275
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:31,440
before to them

2276
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,759
yes

2277
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,000
okay um

2278
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,920
doug yeah i just wanted to echo that i

2279
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:44,960
think

2280
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:48,320
the right way for an ntp 5 server to

2281
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,840
respond to an ntp

2282
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,119
4 request is with an ntp

2283
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:57,760
for response not not to mix them

2284
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,080
and if it can't then just drop it

2285
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:05,599
all right um

2286
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:08,880
so we actually had one more presentation

2287
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:09,679
we had had

2288
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:12,239
doug had uh put together a presentation

2289
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,360
kind of looking at

2290
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:15,520
the mailing list discussion and marisa's

2291
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:16,719
proposal

2292
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:18,560
and sort of like key issues in a way

2293
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,639
forward i probably should have moved to

2294
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,199
that a little bit before now

2295
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:24,639
daniel did you want something else on

2296
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,520
this or do you want to

2297
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:35,520
oh all right um

2298
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:40,880
so let me get these slides up

2299
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:46,000
uh application window key issues

2300
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,360
i did i did put this at one point on the

2301
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:51,199
email reflector so a lot of you have

2302
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:52,639
seen it but i just sort of gathered

2303
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:54,560
together some of the

2304
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,639
issues that were being debated on the

2305
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,320
email reflector

2306
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,920
uh next slide please um regarding

2307
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:07,280
what ntp version 5 should be um

2308
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,320
i think this is a just a statement it's

2309
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,639
going to make ntp version 4 works very

2310
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:15,040
well

2311
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,719
for many for most ntp

2312
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:22,960
applications um as sort of a general it

2313
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:27,040
use and we need to preserve that um

2314
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,600
yeah everything startup issue is not

2315
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,800
solved

2316
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,719
as we know but everything else works

2317
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:33,840
really well

2318
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:36,560
um so this has to be preserved next

2319
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,960
slide

2320
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:41,679
so the question is why why are we doing

2321
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:42,880
it greater accuracy

2322
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,600
flexibility of for other kinds of use

2323
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,280
cases

2324
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,679
mandatory security to push users to

2325
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:51,280
adopt security that's

2326
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:54,320
something that has been proposed um as

2327
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,000
well as uniform monolithic

2328
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,040
time scales like tii um

2329
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,040
to avoid time leap seconds at least in

2330
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,199
the time stamps and

2331
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,320
uh simplify ntp world by moving everyone

2332
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,159
to client server mode which also has

2333
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:10,159
some security advantages

2334
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:13,280
um next slide so these

2335
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,360
these are things that people had i said

2336
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,719
these are what ntp

2337
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,920
version five should should do uh

2338
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,639
and i think at the time when i did this

2339
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:23,119
uh

2340
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:26,239
i think this was what i found

2341
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:28,960
in terms of um the requirements draft

2342
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:30,800
had the flexibility had the mandatory

2343
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,920
security

2344
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,400
the monotonic time scale um

2345
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:40,560
and the draft so far

2346
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,360
my miroslav had improved accuracy had

2347
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,719
the flexibility as well

2348
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:49,040
and and client server only mode

2349
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:51,280
so there's some agreement but also some

2350
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:54,480
differences between those two

2351
01:46:54,480 --> 01:47:00,239
next slide to improved accuracy

2352
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,800
this is very important for

2353
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:06,320
for certain applications there are

2354
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,159
people who tell me they want to get 50

2355
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:09,679
nanoseconds

2356
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:12,880
with using ntp

2357
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:16,719
and this is generally in financial

2358
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:19,360
networks

2359
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:24,080
and so they take the ntp vore

2360
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,679
packet and they throw out everything

2361
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:27,440
else and they basically do

2362
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,800
high message rates like ptp and

2363
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,920
um and specialized

2364
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,159
algorithms with things like lucky packet

2365
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:37,760
filters etc

2366
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:42,080
and they are able to do pretty well

2367
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,280
and i would point out also that the

2368
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:53,360
the mirror slosh drafts does have

2369
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,360
correction fields that also can help

2370
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,040
with these kind of high accuracy

2371
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,639
use cases and these are usually in

2372
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,960
smaller sort of small private networks

2373
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:01,280
in

2374
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:04,320
one subnet typically

2375
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,360
okay next slide

2376
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,719
okay flexibility again for these kind of

2377
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:16,560
specialized use cases

2378
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,000
um you know when you

2379
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,080
detach the algorithms then things like

2380
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,119
chronos also becomes just another

2381
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:29,360
set of algorithms that goes with the ntp

2382
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:33,199
protocol as as well as these high

2383
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:34,239
accuracy things and

2384
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:36,639
and and some other whatever else people

2385
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,480
want to do for some specialized

2386
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:41,919
application um

2387
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:47,040
i think it it might make sense to have

2388
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,320
uh an informative document at some point

2389
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,440
saying hey if you want to

2390
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,840
get the general it case to work with a

2391
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,840
very good set of algorithms here's

2392
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,840
here's an outline of how they work

2393
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:06,400
okay next slide please

2394
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:10,800
a mandatory security um

2395
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,599
there is some precedence for this being

2396
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:14,400
you know pushed

2397
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:17,599
into uh new versions of protocols and

2398
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:19,840
people grumble at first and then

2399
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,520
eventually everyone's saying well

2400
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,719
of course we have to have that

2401
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,400
maybe there's some niche applications

2402
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,140
that aren't gonna want that um

2403
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:29,920
[Music]

2404
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:31,920
i think it's more likely that the there

2405
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,840
will some be some niche education

2406
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:36,960
that might want a different version of

2407
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:37,760
security

2408
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:41,119
so i think that's probably

2409
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:43,920
what we are going to want to look at uh

2410
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,280
to maintain the

2411
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:48,239
flexibility that we started enabling is

2412
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:49,840
to say okay

2413
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:51,760
here here's the default security

2414
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:54,320
mechanism and here's a couple of others

2415
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,080
that have been that can also be used if

2416
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,320
you have to use one of these

2417
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:03,520
so something like that is a possibility

2418
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,599
and i also want to put your security

2419
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:07,599
tends to change

2420
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:10,880
all the time new threats new

2421
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:13,199
capabilities among the threats and so

2422
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,960
new

2423
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:17,280
new algorithms and you know these things

2424
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:19,360
things are always changing so i

2425
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:22,320
i think it might be easier to decouple

2426
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:22,719
them

2427
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:25,280
in terms of documents like the base

2428
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,199
document says you will use one of these

2429
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:28,560
and that's a list that can be just

2430
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,159
maintained easily

2431
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:33,040
and then the other things are developed

2432
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,599
separately

2433
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,320
okay next line

2434
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,520
the monotonic time scale if we're going

2435
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:44,480
to do amount of

2436
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,920
times ago it really should be tai

2437
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:47,599
because that's a international standard

2438
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:47,920
not

2439
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:52,000
something like that like gps time or

2440
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,440
something that doesn't

2441
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,040
necessarily always make sense so um

2442
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:00,000
and that no leap seconds in the protocol

2443
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,440
that's really an overstatement because

2444
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,159
you can do

2445
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,800
tai time stamps and still have a utc

2446
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:08,719
offset that's exactly what btp does

2447
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:10,880
and if you want ta time you can ignore

2448
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,239
the utc offset

2449
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:14,239
and it's monotonic but you can also get

2450
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:15,360
utc which is

2451
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,639
basically required

2452
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:21,280
it's it's legal requirements it's in a

2453
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,719
lot of technical standards you have to

2454
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:23,520
have utc

2455
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,560
so um but there are other niche

2456
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,599
things where people want ut1 or

2457
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:31,440
or some other things and you know one of

2458
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:33,520
the things that's in miraslav's proposal

2459
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,840
is

2460
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,040
you could you can select other time

2461
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,119
scales and just let people know

2462
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:44,000
that could also be handled with time

2463
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,080
scales always tai but there's a field

2464
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,840
where you can put the offset to whatever

2465
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:48,960
you want it to be

2466
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,320
and you'd say it's an offset to utc or

2467
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:53,119
u21

2468
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:58,159
or there's some other ones as well

2469
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,239
so i think

2470
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:04,159
i you know i don't think we're going to

2471
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:06,080
get away from people wanting to do other

2472
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:07,440
time skills

2473
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,678
um

2474
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:17,199
okay next slide please

2475
01:52:17,199 --> 01:52:20,400
okay unicast client server only um

2476
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:25,360
most deployed ntp devices do this um

2477
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:28,159
it makes things makes the protocol

2478
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:29,760
simpler and

2479
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:33,760
help helps with some security issues

2480
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,920
and we don't have a security standard

2481
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,320
that's up to date for the other modes

2482
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:42,560
so that's another another issue um

2483
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,800
some of these modes people are using and

2484
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,840
they're happy to use

2485
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,159
that maybe we could say that's fine you

2486
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:49,599
just keep using mtv

2487
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,239
version 4.

2488
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,920
but you know there might be desire for

2489
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:58,000
some some niche application to do

2490
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:58,560
something

2491
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:01,040
quirky

2492
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,520
okay uh i think that's the last one so

2493
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,560
these are just

2494
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,480
things that were being debated i just

2495
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,679
saw

2496
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:11,280
you know there was discussion on all

2497
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:12,480
these things so i kind of gather them

2498
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,679
together in one

2499
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:17,040
one place and say these are our

2500
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,719
you know issues that we need to make a

2501
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:27,440
decision on

2502
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:29,759
okay

2503
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,639
i guess some of uh go ahead carson

2504
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:37,440
yeah karen just asked me on the jabber

2505
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:38,159
and it's very

2506
01:53:38,159 --> 01:53:41,199
maybe easier to just say this so there

2507
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:44,239
was the observation that the security

2508
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:46,400
components are always changing around

2509
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:47,679
you

2510
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:51,440
and one strategy to to deal with that

2511
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,800
is to actually offload that

2512
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,040
to some activity that already has

2513
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,480
maintenance

2514
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:02,560
and one such activity is cosy

2515
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:06,320
so we we have a algorithms registry and

2516
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,239
and all this stuff

2517
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:10,400
in place that that is moving forward in

2518
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,639
particular with algorithms that

2519
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:15,760
make sense for iot devices so maybe

2520
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,599
that's a component you may want to look

2521
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:18,480
at

2522
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:23,839
for for doing security and v5

2523
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:31,119
okay i i'd like to comment on that

2524
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:33,199
you know i i've had a lot of discussions

2525
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:34,719
with security people

2526
01:54:34,719 --> 01:54:37,440
and if they're not familiar with timing

2527
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,199
they say a lot of things that don't make

2528
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,440
any sense for timing protocols

2529
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:46,239
uh time is not data it's a signal um

2530
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:47,840
and it's different in a lot of ways two

2531
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,520
times that are very close

2532
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:51,199
together but different slightly

2533
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,119
different are basically the same and

2534
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,040
that's not true of data

2535
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:56,560
there's just lots of little differences

2536
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,159
and i think

2537
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:00,639
any security for a timing protocol is

2538
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:02,320
going to have to have

2539
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,880
a healthy dose of tiny people involved

2540
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,920
in defining it

2541
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,760
yeah i think that there are different

2542
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,360
levels here the the

2543
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:15,599
actual security protocol that you're

2544
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:16,639
using

2545
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:19,040
that will be very timing specific but

2546
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,360
the lower level components

2547
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:24,560
like identifying hash algorithms and and

2548
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,840
all all this nitty gritty stuff

2549
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,080
that you can get from from a standards

2550
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:33,840
activity like cosy

2551
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:36,239
agreed and we should we should not be

2552
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:39,919
trying to develop that kind of stuff

2553
01:55:44,840 --> 01:55:47,840
ourselves

2554
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,840
okay uh dennis

2555
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,960
um so since it's late

2556
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,840
um can you hear me yes

2557
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,679
you know we've we've had a lot of

2558
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:03,040
discussion about the

2559
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:05,520
philippe smearing and um i know there's

2560
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:06,719
been some discussion about whether or

2561
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:07,679
not security

2562
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:10,560
might be mandatory um without rehashing

2563
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:12,080
all that i'd like to maybe suggest a

2564
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,320
different approach

2565
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:17,360
and that might be that

2566
01:56:17,360 --> 01:56:20,880
do we want to consider for ntp v5

2567
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,400
making a different set of

2568
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,880
recommendations for

2569
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,560
servers that are meant to be connected

2570
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,639
to the broader internet

2571
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:31,199
than we would necessarily for servers

2572
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,119
meant to be used on a customer's closed

2573
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,519
network

2574
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:40,400
and maybe over the broader internet we

2575
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,080
make much stronger recommendations

2576
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:45,199
about security um and

2577
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:48,639
in a in a domain where the customer

2578
01:56:48,639 --> 01:56:50,800
has more direct control over what

2579
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,040
attaches to their network

2580
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:57,840
allow them to be somewhat relaxed

2581
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:07,599
watson i just want to comment on the

2582
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:09,199
recommendation thing

2583
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:13,199
uh what's the cloudflare um it is

2584
01:57:13,199 --> 01:57:16,880
not the way that i.t security is going

2585
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,880
more and more the local network is

2586
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:21,199
untrusted and its specific

2587
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:23,440
authorizations the same you would do as

2588
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,440
operating over the internet

2589
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,199
and more and more companies are in the

2590
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:30,080
position where they don't have a network

2591
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:33,119
they are using services online and so i

2592
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:34,480
think the relevance

2593
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,400
of a close you know closed network

2594
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,560
security environment that's less and

2595
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,280
less relevant

2596
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:46,159
okay um james really quickly because i

2597
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:49,040
just realized we're running out of time

2598
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:52,400
yeah really really quickly um my concern

2599
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,159
with having like a best practices or

2600
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:56,159
something to describe that is it'll be a

2601
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:57,440
serving suggestion

2602
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:58,960
and then we'll end up with more

2603
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:00,560
insecurity

2604
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:06,080
so i can't say i'm a fan of it

2605
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:11,119
all right um watson

2606
01:58:11,440 --> 01:58:16,080
are you left over left over harlan

2607
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:18,400
this is the end of the queue go ahead

2608
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:20,560
there's still a

2609
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,880
significant use case for people on

2610
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,440
networks to

2611
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:28,639
not have to not to choose

2612
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:30,719
not to use security as part of every

2613
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,880
packet and

2614
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,040
i would say that it is not interesting

2615
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:36,400
to a lot of people here

2616
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,400
and perhaps and it may not be

2617
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,880
appropriate for a number of use cases

2618
01:58:40,880 --> 01:58:43,599
it's not appropriate to all use cases

2619
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:43,920
and

2620
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:47,599
i don't want to see us make a

2621
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:49,760
i don't want us i don't want to see us

2622
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:52,239
change a policy choice into a mechanism

2623
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:53,840
choice

2624
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:57,119
or into a mechanism issue

2625
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:02,719
okay um so the

2626
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:06,400
um next item on our agenda was to talk

2627
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:06,960
about

2628
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,760
uh chartering uh we do need to work on a

2629
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,280
working group charter i'm going to defer

2630
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:12,639
that to our virtual interim what's

2631
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:13,599
coming up

2632
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:16,480
uh theater has worked on a very rough

2633
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,520
draft of a

2634
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,239
uh of a charter and we will get that out

2635
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,080
to working group to discuss

2636
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,800
uh and before i do the discussion of

2637
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:27,119
virtual interims uh any other business

2638
01:59:27,119 --> 01:59:28,639
and i know that there's one item that's

2639
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,840
in the other business

2640
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:35,199
yes so i just um

2641
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,639
did i just did we just lose him

2642
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:47,760
oh daniel just went offline well that's

2643
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:49,360
really bad timing

2644
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:50,800
so while we're waiting for daniel to

2645
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,719
come back online uh

2646
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:54,400
there's a lot of time between this

2647
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,159
meeting and the next ietf so i think we

2648
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:57,599
need to work really hard to have at

2649
01:59:57,599 --> 01:59:59,520
least two virtual interims in that time

2650
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:00,800
because i think we have a lot of work to

2651
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:01,199
do

2652
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:04,159
sorry sorry i meant to have i meant to

2653
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:05,199
hit control

2654
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:06,960
control v and i hit control w instead

2655
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:09,520
and close the tab

2656
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:12,719
okay welcome back go ahead yeah um so i

2657
02:00:12,719 --> 02:00:13,440
just wanted to

2658
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:16,480
put in a um a quick plug for uh for

2659
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:19,679
biz time um link now in chat um so

2660
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:22,080
i mentioned this on the on the mailing

2661
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:23,599
list a couple of weeks ago

2662
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:25,360
um and i know people are looking at it

2663
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:27,040
because the github repo keeps on

2664
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:29,119
keeps on piling up stars but as far as

2665
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:31,199
actual feedback i've gotten crickets

2666
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:34,800
um so biz time is byzantine fault

2667
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:35,440
tolerant

2668
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,679
uh time synchronization between a group

2669
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:38,800
of peers

2670
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:41,199
um when all you care about is keeping

2671
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:43,440
those peers in sync with each other and

2672
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,119
advancing at something very close to one

2673
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:47,520
second per second um without neces

2674
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:48,960
without caring about

2675
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,560
whether this drifts in the long term

2676
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:52,239
from any authoritative time source like

2677
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:53,360
tai

2678
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,560
um so this so this has been in

2679
02:00:56,560 --> 02:00:58,480
um what i have now for this is an

2680
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,239
implementation it's it's a good robust

2681
02:01:00,239 --> 02:01:01,520
secure implementation it's been in

2682
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,400
production

2683
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,880
with us for about a year um i do not

2684
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:05,520
have

2685
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,880
a draft at this time i'm planning to

2686
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:11,199
write it up as a right to i'm planning

2687
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:12,400
to write it up as

2688
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:15,599
as a as an experimental track id

2689
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:17,840
um since there aren't really any stick

2690
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,599
any other stakeholders that i can

2691
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:21,199
identify at this time i'm not planning

2692
02:01:21,199 --> 02:01:22,960
i'm planning to do this through the

2693
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,960
independent stream rather than a rather

2694
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:26,560
than as working group draft

2695
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:29,520
um obviously if if significant interest

2696
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,440
picks up then we then we could we could

2697
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:33,040
we could circle back and pursue

2698
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:34,480
something standards track

2699
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:37,760
but anyway um at this time i'm just i'm

2700
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,199
just interested in hearing from people

2701
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:43,360
if you're using this or if you if even

2702
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:44,800
if you just have any any theoretical

2703
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,400
applications in mind other than other

2704
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,599
than um

2705
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:51,040
um that i haven't thought of um i just

2706
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:53,280
just want just that just just want to

2707
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:56,080
keep people in the loop

2708
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,719
okay uh this was sent to the mailing

2709
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:01,840
list i don't know if you want to send a

2710
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:04,400
reminder

2711
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,759
and

2712
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,719
i don't know if this is great stuff is

2713
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:13,440

all right so um the um

2717
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,280
so i we like i said i think we need to

2718
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:28,719
have a virtual interim

2719
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:31,440
um looking at the weeks of april 13th or

2720
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:33,040
april 20th

2721
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:37,520
um if anybody has any

2722
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:39,199
major conflicts that we should try and

2723
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:41,760
avoid please send them to diateranai

2724

with that i

2730
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:02,000

2732
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:07,360

two-week meeting

2747
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,760
so i just thought i'd mention that that

2748
02:03:45,760 --> 02:03:49,040
could be a conflict for some folks

2749
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:51,199
right we could go to the week of april

2750
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:52,639
6th um

2751
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:55,280
if um that's the week after easter but i

2752
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,400
guess it's since it's going to be

2753
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:59,920
virtual it may not matter as much

2754
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,360
and that's one two three one two

2755
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:11,839
three that's only four weeks from now

2756
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,679
okay send us your comments on scheduling

2757
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:19,440
and we'll see where we end up

2758
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,199
we're now four minutes over so i guess i

2759
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:24,320
should probably end this

2760
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:29,920
