they understand not the technical

discussions about it what's the right

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,140
way obviously what we shown here as a

7
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,630
lot of proof concept there are so it's

8
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,300
good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all these discussions there</font>

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,939
and initiate a few more ideas and

00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">thoughts about the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">is in the source destination routing and</font>

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,989
the different modes we have all these

16
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:50,928
the open ability and device is so we

00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:54,248
have a role on implementation open
