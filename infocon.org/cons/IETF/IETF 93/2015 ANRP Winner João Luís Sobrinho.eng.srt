I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> very fortunate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having received</font>

2
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:11,169
this award especially because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it award</font>

research price many colleagues of mine

00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,840
would tell me that I would more

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,390
theoretical person but I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,670
problems which are rooted on what most

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,120
people call reality but from which you

9
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,650
can also extract some fundamental

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,420
problem to be addressed and I believe

11
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,689
this work combines<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two things the</font>

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:34,059
theoretical aspect and it has also a

13
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,420
practical practical aspect coming here

14
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:40,269
was it was new<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">because an opportunity to talk with</font>

16
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:45,239
people coming directly from from the

17
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,069
operators from vendors from

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,909
standardization not just from my field

19
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:54,370
of researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people and so that was</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greater opportunity and my</font>

questions and comments which enrich my

questions about practical things angles

that I have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen which are material</font>
