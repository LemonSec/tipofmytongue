00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,040
hi I'm Dan York with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">society and i'm here at the 93rd meeting</font>

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,930
of the internet engineering task force

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:20,080
or ITF here in Prague i'm here with IETF

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,240
chair yari<font color="#CCCCCC"> arco hello yaari hai damn so</font>

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">I understand this was one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our larger</font>

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,110
IETF meetings can you talk a bit about

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,579
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty last meeting we had</font>

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually more countries than we've ever</font>

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:33,370
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an IDF meetings 65 countries and</font>

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,649
thirteen hundred plus participants very

12
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good turnout we also had remote ops</font>

13
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,940
in Latin America and many remote

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,460
participants so very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,230
that's great now the technical plenary

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,910
had a topic about vehicle-to-vehicle

17
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,500
communication it was very enlightening

18
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,569
to understand sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we're all</font>

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,040
going with these wired objects and

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,960
things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's actually part of this</font>

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,730
broader context of work of internet of

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,040
things that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing a lot with</font>

23
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,290
here at the ITF could you talk a bit

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,450
about that right we have indeed working

25
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,339
been working quite a bit with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

26
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet of Things we have a number</font>

27
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups around making IP just run</font>

28
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:11,650
on on these small devices and new types

29
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,610
of radios we have working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups dealing</font>

30
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:18,220
with ways to do lightweight transactions

31
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,800
over the web in these devices and so

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,170
forth so a big part of the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,670
activities on on this space one thing

34
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,750
that happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> this week was that we had</font>

35
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,590
an interrupt test the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HC pluck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font>

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,110
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were testing some of these</font>

37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,570
technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's very</font>

38
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,030
happy to see new people in this this

39
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,130
test that had not been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF before</font>

40
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:42,970
and lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of running code so it was</font>

41
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,798
really successful even now the hackathon

42
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,740
this past weekend<font color="#CCCCCC"> also had a great</font>

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,840
amount of IOT right what was going on in

44
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">there over the weekend many many things</font>

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it did have internet of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

46
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,840
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> many other topics we're being</font>

47
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">Delphia various kinds of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rotting</font>

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,320
solutions and and mostly the hackathon

49
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:04,330
is about open source designs and you

50
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it was a big big event so we</font>

51
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,318
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heck of an accident previous</font>

52
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:12,640
ITF where we had about 50 people now we

53
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:15,250
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 120 hundred and thirty or so so it's</font>

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,010
growing quite rapidly and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also there</font>

55
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,769
we saw both new people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have not</font>

56
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,790
been the ITF before we saw not just

57
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,950
individuals part

58
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,129
betting this this hacking event but but

59
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">also lots project such as Oh PMF we</font>

60
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,200
participate in the airport<font color="#CCCCCC"> show it was</font>

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,129
really really good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and a lot of</font>

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting prototypes were made during</font>

63
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,768
the weekend a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of students it was</font>

64
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and overall I</font>

65
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:43,180
mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had just before the ITF formally</font>

66
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,730
began we had these<font color="#E5E5E5"> events like the</font>

67
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,209
hackathon or the etsy test and those

68
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">were not the only one so so we had maybe</font>

69
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:54,220
150 people or so working hard on own

70
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:55,689
code which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course what actually</font>

71
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,620
makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet run rather than the</font>

72
00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:01,060
specifications and I also saw many of

73
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,620
these things being referred to later in

74
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,870
the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the working groups so</font>

75
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,180
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> had learned about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs in the</font>

76
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,459
specifications and so forth so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

77
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,189
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really good thing yeah I was</font>

78
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:14,409
at the hackathon working on security dns

79
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,459
security issues and it was it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

80
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:18,548
great experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be there the whole</font>

81
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,829
nobody kept locked lock hours but it was

82
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,470
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as you said in a couple of the</font>

83
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS working groups later that work and</font>

84
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,129
the code was brought back in the show's

85
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,109
was a really neat to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the synergy of</font>

86
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:30,429
the rough of the rough consensus and

87
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,870
running code as we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

88
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that was just one example I didn't</font>

89
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually go the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS working groups but I</font>

90
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:38,109
saw I didn't any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> places so yeah it</font>

91
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,149
was great to see in those spaces so

92
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:41,919
speaking of security you know what's the

93
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,940
IT have been doing around security

94
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,159
encryption all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of things</font>

95
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,109
these days right so we of course care

96
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,578
about the security a lot at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

97
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,919
feel that we're responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

98
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,690
security of our protocols we think about

99
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:55,030
things like privacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

100
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,459
can we do about that and of course it

101
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,940
justs<font color="#E5E5E5"> our technical work it's just a</font>

102
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:03,549
part of the overall issue so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

103
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,560
such communication security obviously in

104
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,599
system security and policies all kinds

105
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other things also come into the play</font>

106
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,030
we do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work at the ITF around</font>

107
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,280
secured at the end we have a project on

108
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,579
redoing TLS the protocol underneath

109
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,810
https that's ongoing one thing that

110
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">would perhaps highlight here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as an</font>

111
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">example that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on improving</font>

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,789
the privacy of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns so when you make DNS</font>

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,139
queries and ask for a particular names

114
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:32,710
we're building protocols that would make

115
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,270
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to hide the question and</font>

116
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,090
answer from

117
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,859
the local access network now another

118
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,140
area<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came up in the in the</font>

119
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,730
hackathon was a real-time communication

120
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,590
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> video and all these kinds of</font>

121
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,580
things what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on what are some of</font>

122
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the highlights of what's happening at</font>

123
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,109
the ITF Iran<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right that's another</font>

124
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,530
big area at the IETF and and the new

125
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,430
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this week has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the net VC</font>

126
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,960
working group who had their first

127
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,420
meeting and this is a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

128
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,729
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with video codecs and that's of</font>

129
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,410
course underlying everything and we do

130
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,700
multimedia communications video

131
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,860
communicates you need to have some

132
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,960
codecs where you can exchange the

133
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,690
information in an interoperable manner

134
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,840
and not use too much bandwidth and

135
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,510
they're working on this and a very

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,049
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> area has a lot of interest and</font>

137
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:21,610
this this is what what's underlying the

138
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,650
ability of browsers to communicate with

139
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other as us as you know we're</font>

140
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,359
moving to a world where most of these

141
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,710
communications are over over the

142
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,000
interval all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> communications</font>

143
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,820
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the Internet and much of</font>
