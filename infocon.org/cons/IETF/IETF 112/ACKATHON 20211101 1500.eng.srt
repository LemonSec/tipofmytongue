1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,680
my

2
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,520
okay hello everyone good to see we have

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,000
a number of people uh joining already

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,239
welcome to the hackathon

5
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,840
um we're going to give it a few more

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,320
minutes just to let people

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,039
get

8
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
logged in successfully to meet techo for

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,760
some people this may be uh their first

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
time attending the hackathon or

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,600
attending this way and

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,680
um can take a little while to get things

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
set up correctly

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
not to mention the the time changes and

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
hopefully that

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,479
all of you are here so that's a good

17
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,520
sign

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,119
but i know with europe switching their

19
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,680
clocks on a different uh

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,240
schedule from say the us

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,159
uh that just adds a little bit of extra

22
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,680
confusion so

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,119
if you're here congratulations that

24
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,119
you've navigated all that correctly

25
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,040
hopefully others will as well

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,079
and

27
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,520
we'll get started in just a few minutes

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,940
[Music]

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,200
so

30
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,720
okay hello again everyone um i think

31
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,959
we'll go ahead and get started i study a

32
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,519
few people are still joining but uh

33
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,879
you know in the interest of everyone's

34
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,959
time now this may be a very challenging

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,799
time for you to join and my apologies

36
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,280

you know this session is

39
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,238
really meant to be quite informal i'm

40
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
going to run through some slides but

41
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,360
it's mainly

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
uh to share some information uh get

43
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,520
questions answered

44
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,160
that you may have

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
and uh so feel free to jump in using the

46
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,400
chat at any time we don't have a huge

47
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,120
number of people at least not yet so

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,360
it's also fine for you to just jump in

49
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,880
using the mic

50
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,520
um either way make sure you just get uh

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,840
my attention or berries and we'll do

52
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,759
what we can to help answer your

53
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,120
questions

54
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
and um

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,000
you know if i go over something too

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
quick feel free to stop me at any time

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
this session is is really here for all

58
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,199
of you

59
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,680
it shouldn't take anywhere near the full

60
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
hour but we can always spend time diving

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
into topics and at the end

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,720
if anyone wants to share a bit of more

63
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,199
information about the project i know

64
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,960
you may be leading a project and if so

65
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
thanks for doing that

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
and there's a lot of information on the

67
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,960
wiki as we'll show but i'll invite you

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,759
to

69
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,600
say a few words about your project as

70
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,120
well if you'd like to

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
so with that let me let me go ahead and

72
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,919
jump in um

73
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,800
so for those of you who have uh this is

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
your first hackathon or perhaps you've

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
only attended recently and experienced

76
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
online hackathons

77
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,120
this is more what a typical ietf

78
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,960
hackathon where we are able to meet in

79
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
person looks like in fact this is one of

80
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,120
our our biggest and best we had

81
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,039
uh if you can believe it close to 400

82
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
people in the room at one time which

83
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
actually was a problem in and of itself

84
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,199
but it was great to see

85
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
and the dynamics are a bit different now

86
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
with people spread over geographies and

87
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,199
time zones we still have a lot of great

88
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
participation which is fantastic but uh

89
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,080
but you know we meet online and um

90
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
there's a lot more flexibility than in

91
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
the schedule as to exactly how you go

92
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
about doing that

93
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,639
so

94
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,960
in order to help with meeting online we

95
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
have some great tools first of all this

96
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,919
new techo

97
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,080
uh tool that we're using right now to to

98
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,520
do this kickoff

99
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,800
but also if you haven't checked out

100
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
gather yet um i highly recommend that

101
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,840
we'll be making use of the gather space

102
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,759
what you see up on the screen and i'll

103
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,000
go into it in a bit more detail later on

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,199
is

105
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,000
a bit of the ietf sorry of the hackathon

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,960
space

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,039
and we just have tables there much like

108
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,960
you saw in the previous slide where

109
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
people can arrange teams can arrange

110
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,800
around the table

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,880
and just to facilitate

112
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,759
chatting and working within your team so

113
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,360
um you know

114
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,880
if you haven't checked out that space

115
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,800
yet i recommend you do by the way these

116
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,960
slides are uploaded you'll see there's a

117
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,720
lot of links in here you can click on

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
them to to get directly to a lot of the

119
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,400
things that i'm showing in this

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,039
presentation

121
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,479
uh first of all i should probably step

122
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,560
back a little bit um especially for

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
those of you who haven't been to many of

124
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
these hackathons

125
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
really why are we here and what's the

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
whole goal with these

127
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,880
and the idea is to really accelerate the

128
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
work we're doing in the ietf around

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,759
standards by by taking some of that

130
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
speed and collaborative spirit that we

131
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
see with open source

132
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,360
and bringing it into standards not that

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
it wasn't there before but you know that

134
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
this is a a new way or a way to engage

135
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
with more people around more than just

136
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,919
what's written down in the

137
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,919
specifications but

138
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
ideally working on code that

139
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
has some correlation to what we're

140
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,120
standardizing to help make the standards

141
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
better and

142
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
and easier to implement and more

143
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,720
accessible to developers and others in

144
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,840
general

145
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,680
and also to just attract more people

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
people who might not have considered

147
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,680
themselves uh standards people until

148
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,199
they realize that hey there's a lot of

149
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,639
great software development that goes

150
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,639
along with it and perhaps that's more

151
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,199
the angle in which they uh choose to and

152
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,599
enjoy participating in the ietf and we

153
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,280
welcome you and encourage you to get

154
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,759
involved and and we have a great mix of

155
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,599
people in the ietf

156
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,400
uh with different experiences and um and

157
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,479
the hackathon is a great way to

158
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,240
connect and collaborate with people

159
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
so the the notewell all of what we do

160
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,559
within the ietf um

161
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
we follow the rules are are under the

162
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,958
rules of the note well if you haven't

163
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,719
taken a look at that yet it's a good

164
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
thing to to have a look at it you can

165
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,240
see several bcps

166
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
referenced there

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
a lot of it's sort of common sense but a

168
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
lot of it's very good to keep in mind

169
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,200
especially in terms of your

170
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
contributions to the ietf and what that

171
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,399
means in terms of perhaps uh patents

172
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,160
copyrights ipr those types of things

173
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,519
however one of the things i like to

174
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,440
point out is that

175
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
when you're working

176
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,240
in the hackathon you're typically

177
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
working on code and uh

178
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
there should be a license associated

179
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
with that code

180
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,720
and so the code that you're actually

181
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
working on is probably not in and of

182
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
itself an ietf contribution rather it's

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,000
uh

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,640
it's governed by the the license that is

185
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
in place and the example i show here

186
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
it's under the apache 2.0 license which

187
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,880
is a common open source license

188
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,720
and so then the way you interact with

189
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,880
that community and with that code and

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,839
the terms of use there and of

191
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,279
contribution are as sent out in that

192
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
license

193
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
however when we do have the

194
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
presentations

195
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,680
um on friday

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,440
and you're presenting what you did in

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
your project now those are itf

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
contributions as usual as if you made

199
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
one in a working group session

200
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
as an example

201
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,279
and

202
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,839
okay

203
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
um now just a reminder about inclusive

204
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
language uh this is this is important in

205
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,760
that you know we all come from different

206
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,120
backgrounds

207
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
and have have different experience we

208
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
want to make this a very welcoming

209
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
uh place and a very safe place and a

210
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,800
friendly place for for people to work

211
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,880
so um you know we tend to have a lot of

212
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200
fun and make jokes in that but just be

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,360
sensitive to other people who who may

214
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
come from a different background and uh

215
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
you know we really want to welcome

216
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,560
everyone if and so um just keep that in

217
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,040
mind let's let's participate

218
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,760
um civilly and and uh when we have

219
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
differences in opinion um let's just be

220
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,560
respectful on how we deal with those

221
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
historically the hackathon's been a

222
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,519
great venue for that so i absolutely

223
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
expect that to continue but it also

224
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,279
doesn't help to or it doesn't hurt to

225
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,079
show the reminder

226
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,519
okay i mentioned projects at the

227
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,399
beginning

228
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,519
and we have a great uh list of projects

229
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
and what i'm showing right now is a

230
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,760
snapshot of the wiki uh if you go there

231
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,839
you'll see all of the projects uh that

232
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
we have planned for the hackathon

233
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,959
and uh the people who we call champions

234
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,560
who are actually leading those projects

235
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
have put together some really nice

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
information that helps you have a better

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,920
understanding both of what the project

238
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,640
is

239
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,320
and then how to reach out to them if you

240
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,959
want to participate and so

241
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,640
um now or after this uh session is over

242
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,880
if you haven't already is a great time

243
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
to engage with those

244
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
uh those champions and just you know

245
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,320
start uh discussing with them about

246
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
how you can be involved in the project

247
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
um if you're not sure which project to

248
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,880
join

249
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
um something you might want to check out

250
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,519
is this lost and found area and what we

251
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,519
did was we put this together as a place

252
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,399
where

253
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,279
uh let's say you're you're you you have

254
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,120
areas of interest but you haven't found

255
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,880
a project that really resonates with you

256
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
yet and you want to let others know hey

257
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
these are things i can help you out with

258
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
if your project needs them

259
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,440
um

260
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
on the flip side if you're leading a

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,839
project and you really need

262
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,480
some a certain skill set or someone with

263
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
that that skill set to help you with

264
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,480
your project you can also sort of

265
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,360
advertise that need here so the lost and

266
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
found is to help

267
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
match up people with projects a little

268
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,839
bit better

269
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,720
and so we you know clear it out at the

270
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
start of each hackathon you'll probably

271
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
see there isn't too much information

272
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,040
there but you know feel free and don't

273
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,880
be nervous about adding your information

274
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,760
there if you have a need in your project

275
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,320
for people or if you're trying to or if

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,760
you're interested in just helping other

277
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
projects

278
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,800
hopefully that'll be a good resource for

279
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,959
you

280
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,800
now the the agenda we're we're doing the

281
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,880
kickoff right now as i said it shouldn't

282
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,880
take the whole hour but we should in any

283
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,200
case certainly finish within the hour

284
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,920
and then really the whole week is just

285
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,320
up to the individual projects to decide

286
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,959
how and when to meet and we did this

287
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,519
because of time zones and realizing that

288
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,200
it could be very challenging for people

289
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,079
to meet at specific times so each team

290
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,480
can at least try to find a time and

291
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,000
place or times multiple times in places

292
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,160
and you know ways of working together

293
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
that work for their team

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,639
so the team schedule that you see a

295
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
picture of in the links there as well

296
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,279
is the way that we help organize that if

297
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,760
you enter into the team schedule the

298
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
times and the ways that your specific

299
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,399
project team wants to meet um that can

300
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,760
really help

301
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,000
everyone within the team and even some

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,600
new people that you might not have been

303
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,600
aware of that wanted to work with you

304
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,760
now they know how to engage with you so

305
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
i highly recommend project champions if

306
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
you haven't yet get your information up

307
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,959
there

308
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
those participating in projects take a

309
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,040
look because that's a good way to figure

310
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,639
out

311
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,279
how to get involved

312
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,880
and then at the same time that this

313
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,120
session started we have the hackathon

314
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,959
closing on friday

315
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,040
and that's really probably um one of the

316
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
most interesting parts of the hackathon

317
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
that's when all of the teams come

318
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,199
together to share what it was that you

319
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,720
you actually accomplished during this

320
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
hackathon

321
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,839
now because we have many teams we keep

322
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,839
those presentations very short but this

323
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
is a great time for you to

324
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,320
uh to share that information and so we

325
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,880
have it scheduled for two hours

326
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,800
on friday starting at the same time that

327
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,920
we started here at 1500 utc and ending

328
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,519
at 1700.

329
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,959
so um

330
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,720
mark that on your calendars now you'll

331
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
see that there is a

332
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,760
schedule

333
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
for the results presentation and what

334
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that schedule is if you click on that

335
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,800
link

336
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
you'll be able to um if you're leading a

337
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,760
project team or the one presenting on

338
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
behalf of our project team you can sign

339
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
up to say yeah i'd like to you know

340
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,639
present our results during that and that

341
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
way we get a list of all the teams

342
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,440
and uh everyone else knows what they're

343
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
going to hear if they

344
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
if they sign into this results

345
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
presentation so if you plan on sharing

346
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760
results on friday and it doesn't matter

347
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
if you didn't accomplish everything you

348
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,320
wanted to just you know share what you

349
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,639
did do and what you did learn

350
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,160
so if you're interested in doing that i

351
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
encourage you to add your team name to

352
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,519
the

353
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
results presentation as soon as possible

354
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,920
um and robert you mentioned it would be

355
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
nice to get an ics off the team schedule

356
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,240
page yeah that's uh

357
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,120
that is a good point um

358
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,759
[Music]

359
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,680
yeah we could certainly try that and one

360
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,759
of the challenges is the the list of

361
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,759
teams is constantly updating but i guess

362
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
it's not too different than an agenda

363
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,000
for a meeting so yeah with that that's

364
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,680
actually a great idea

365
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
um

366
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,320
we'll have to look into that and if you

367
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,839
can help make that happen robert that'd

368
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
be great

369
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,399
fantastic

370
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,800
um okay so now gather i mentioned that a

371
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,320
little bit earlier i'm just going to go

372
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,920
through it in a little bit more detail

373
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,519
in case you haven't checked it out and

374
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,199
just help you with some of the initial

375
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,639
navigation

376
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,560
the space for

377
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,600
for this

378
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,399
ietf meeting ietf112

379
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
is a little bit a little bit updated and

380
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,759
hopefully in some really nice ways what

381
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,240
you see here is kind of the the main

382
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,880
area when you first enter the ietf

383
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
hackathon space and there's something

384
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,959
called the mini map that lets you kind

385
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,880
of see

386
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,639
a high-level view of the whole space and

387
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,720
that's what i've done here you can see

388
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,959
the arrows pointing to the

389
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,759
uh

390
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,040
to the right

391
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,800
uh near the bottom of the page leading

392
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
you to the hackathon space

393
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,959
so if you follow that you'll enter into

394
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,199
the room where the hackathon is and

395
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,199
where all of those tables that i showed

396
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,360
you earlier are and the link is at the

397
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,199
top there it's also on the wiki

398
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,320
so when i do follow that those arrows

399
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,240
and i go into the hackathon space this

400
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
is what you see

401
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,079
and in the background i have kind of the

402
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,639
zoomed in

403
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,359
view of the space and then

404
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,359
what i did was i used the mini map here

405
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,199
so you can see the entire space so

406
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,280
there's there's eight

407
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
tables there

408
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
project teams if you want to you're

409
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
welcome to kind of use those tables if

410
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,919
you want to meet there when your team is

411
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
working say

412
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,520
oh you know such and such project team

413
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,400
we're going to meet at table c at

414
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,840
you know uh

415
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,760
1400 utc to 1600 utc whatever works for

416
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,559
you

417
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,360
and then um you know you can gather

418
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
around that table you'll see that you're

419
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,600
able to enter into an audio and video

420
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
conference with each other

421
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
a couple nice features that are in there

422
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,160
is if you go up to these

423
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,520
[Music]

424
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
the white board which you see on the

425
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,280
right hand side you can see it kind of

426
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,160
lit up in yellow similarly on the left

427
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,799
hand side you can see a notepad on table

428
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,120
c that's lit up in yellow you can

429
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
interact with that so your team can

430
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,480
share

431
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,520
a notepad which is powered by hedgedock

432
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
or one of these whiteboards that's built

433
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,919
into uh the gather

434
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
space so that's a nice way for your team

435
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,080
to collaborate as well and i encourage

436
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,400
you to try that out and make use of it

437
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
you know make it a little bit easier for

438
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,799
for your team to collaborate on things

439
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,280
of course if you're using zoom or webex

440
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,679
or whatever your

441
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
video conference uh another video

442
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,559
conferencing system that's fine too but

443
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,440
all of that's also built in together and

444
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,960
i encourage you to check it out and see

445
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,240
what works best for your team

446
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,280
so some of you may have seen uh

447
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
michael was mentioning this at the

448
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,400
beginning of the call as we were waiting

449
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
for people to join

450
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
um the ietf vpn network

451
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,640
which is we call hacknet

452
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,039
and what that is is you know many of you

453
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,200
of course are working on ietf protocols

454
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,120
oftentimes it's very

455
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
important for you to be on

456
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
a shared network

457
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,160
maybe a shared like l2 network you need

458
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
that capability in order to be able to

459
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
do some of the testing that you want to

460
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,320
be able to do

461
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,480
as part of the hackathon but for

462
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,960
whatever reason we always at each ietf

463
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
meeting have an ietf network and what

464
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,960
you're able to do now is you're able to

465
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
vpn into

466
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,360
that ietf network which

467
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
is available and there's some

468
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
instructions there about the devices you

469
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,600
need in order to do that and exactly the

470
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,440
configuration to do to get added so

471
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
check and see if you're if that's useful

472
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
for your team and if they're using that

473
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,960
hopefully you've already started getting

474
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
this set up as you need

475
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,039
specific devices in this case a

476
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,480
microtech device but it's a really handy

477
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,799
functionality that you know helps teams

478
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,840
work on

479
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,840
on various ietf protocols together

480
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,320
now i mentioned the results

481
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
presentations and this is one of my

482
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,440
favorite parts of the hackathon

483
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,799
even though it comes near the end and

484
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,919
i'm always a little sad for the

485
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,159
hackathon to end but it's fantastic to

486
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,559
see what people did and so this is where

487
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,760
we share

488
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
uh just some of the highlights of our

489
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,159
project what it was we were trying to do

490
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,919
what actually got accomplished what

491
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,240
things we learned around along the way

492
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,720
perhaps some important things that

493
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,400
your team wants to bring back into your

494
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,120
working group uh related to things you

495
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
discovered about the draft you were

496
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,640
trying to implement or the protocol that

497
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
your group is standardizing

498
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,520
so uh those are fantastic

499
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,280
learnings to take away from the

500
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
hackathon that's really one of the big

501
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,159
goals of it

502
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,880
we also like to know about collaboration

503
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
that happened like perhaps your your um

504
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
your project was really about a protocol

505
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,360
that's being worked on in one specific

506
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,520
working group but maybe you interacted

507
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,600
with people from other working groups or

508
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
maybe even from people outside of the

509
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,840
ietf maybe from open source communities

510
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,320
or another standards organization

511
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,000
those types of things are really great

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,640
to see and the hackathon helps foster

513
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,039
that type of collaboration

514
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,679
and um you know beyond just the

515
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,720
uh the regular work group collaboration

516
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,400
and so we like to hear about that as

517
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,480
well

518
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,840
although we also

519
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,039
it's very important to keep these

520
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,200
presentations short and i'll stress this

521
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,039
again on friday but i wanted to make

522
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,480
that point now

523
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,280
um five minutes at the very most

524
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
because we do have a number of them to

525
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,080
get through we only have two hours

526
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,840
again it could be a very inconvenient

527
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
time for a lot of people so

528
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,840
you know whether we woke up early or

529
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
we're staying up late so we want to

530
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,840
value people's time and the idea is that

531
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
it's a short presentation so people at

532
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
least understand what you did and then

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,240
they can always reach out to you

534
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,039
later that day the next week whenever

535
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,840
and get a deeper dive into what you did

536
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
this is just to give that that very high

537
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,159
level view and to sort of connect people

538
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,080
or help them realize that they they have

539
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,039
a reason to connect

540
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,000
now in order to help with all that we're

541
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,960
doing around code we created

542
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,880
this ietf hackathon github organization

543
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,799
and we use this for a number of things

544
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,480
some of you have

545
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,799
repositories there for the code that

546
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,360
you're working on and that's fantastic

547
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,480
of course your code can exist anywhere

548
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,919
you probably want it to be publicly

549
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,840
available somewhere so that of course

550
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,799
all of you can access it and work on it

551
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,720
if you need or would like to have a

552
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
repository created for your project for

553
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,039
sharing code

554
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,440
let me know i can get that created for

555
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,159
you

556
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,120
but it's also um within this itf

557
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,840
hackathon github org is where we keep

558
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
our where we upload the project

559
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
presentations that we'll be doing on

560
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,039
friday

561
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,360
so there is a specific repository

562
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,919
created for this ietf hackathon i'm

563
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,480
showing it there it's ietf 112 project

564
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,679
presentations and if you click into that

565
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
you'll find a readme that gives you

566
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,440
a lot of great information about

567
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,960
how to get uh first of all like if

568
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,720
if you're going to upload a project

569
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,440
presentation into that repository you

570
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,679
need to be a member of the ietf github

571
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,280
organization

572
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,559
and

573
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,440
so sign up now get yourself added as a

574
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,400
member

575
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
and then once you're added as a member

576
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
you'll have right access to that

577
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,640
repository and that way you'll be

578
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
independently able to upload and update

579
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,679
your presentation there for those of you

580
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,279
who are familiar with github you might

581
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,120
think oh why don't i just send charles

582
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
or barry why don't i send a pull request

583
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,400
and they can

584
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,880
they can add it in and that's true

585
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,799
but um in general

586
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,159
there's a lot going on with the

587
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,919
hackathon and you may send a pull

588
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,000
request and we might not get to it in

589
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,159
time and then your presentation won't be

590
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,360
there so what we prefer to do is set you

591
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
up as a member and that way you can be

592
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,640
responsible for getting your own

593
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,279
presentation there

594
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,600
now since we we make a lot of different

595
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,919
people members and and there's

596
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
uh privileges that go with that we also

597
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,000
as we should be are worried about

598
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
security

599
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
so we we ask that you

600
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
you enable two-factor authentication on

601
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,679
your github account and also to make it

602
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,320
just easier for us to know who's who

603
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,080
make sure you add your name to your

604
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,120
github

605
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,080
account

606
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,000
a lot of us have sort of a cryptic say

607
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
username as we do with perhaps our

608
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,520
emails

609
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,440
but add your the name by which you're

610
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,559
known as well that really helps so that

611
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,080
we're able to find each other and know

612
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,520
who each other is and get done

613
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
now to help with the results

614
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
presentations we put together a couple

615
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
templates one in powerpoint uh format if

616
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,520
you're

617
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,960
comfortable with doing powerpoint

618
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,640
presentations the other one is an html

619
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,840
html format and you can

620
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,240
use either one

621
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,039
and then use that to

622
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,880
both kind of format

623
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,799
your presentation and just you know get

624
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,720
it started as you typically would with

625
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
that template for anything

626
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
of course you're completely free to not

627
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,760
use those templates you can you can do

628
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,400
the presentation on your own using

629
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,880
whatever format you want just keep in

630
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,559
mind those questions are those things

631
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,720
that i said we like to highlight what it

632
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,039
was you were trying to do what you

633
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,640
accomplished what you learned along the

634
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,720
way and some interesting highlights

635
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,240
about um

636
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,440
perhaps things you're going to bring

637
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,760
back into your working group so that's

638
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,039
important that you have the right

639
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
information in there hopefully the

640
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,039
templates useful and helpful to you but

641
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,960
um whatever works best for you you're

642
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
free to do

643
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,400
and then on friday when we do the

644
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
results presentation

645
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,720
typically we have you present your own

646
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,799
presentation you'll be able to come on

647
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,279
share your audio and video and uh and

648
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,520
then walk through your slides each team

649
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,840
kind of presents their own presentation

650
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,199
and barry and i will help you with that

651
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,679
so i also need to say a big thanks to to

652
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,440
cnnec they are

653
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,120
our running code sponsor for ietf 112

654
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
and so thanks to them we're actually

655
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
able to have this hackathon

656
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,840
um you know there are still expenses

657
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,000
even though it we're meeting virtually

658
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,520
they're a little bit different than a

659
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,120
lot different than when we meet in

660
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,760
person but we still need that support to

661
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,600
keep everything make all these great

662
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,640
tools available and so cnn

663
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,960
thanks to them for for helping for

664
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,559
sponsoring us so that we could have this

665
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,120
hackathon

666
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,919
and so with that i know i went through a

667
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,400
lot of information quickly i hope it was

668
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,559
useful um

669
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,960
very happy to have any questions that

670
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,039
you haven't had answered yet

671
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,279
if anyone has those

672
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,919
and the other thing think about is if

673
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,320
there aren't any questions

674
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,760
then i'd also

675
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,520
encourage any of you who want to say a

676
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,440
few words about your project you can do

677
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
that now to help others just know what

678
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,919
it is you're planning on doing and

679
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,600
and share that information that's

680
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,080
perfectly fine as well

681
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,678
so do we have any questions

682
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,279
